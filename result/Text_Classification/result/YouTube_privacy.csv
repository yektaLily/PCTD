"Privacy, data harvesting, and more. So to begin, Google (YouTubes owner) has already been in hot water over just how much personal data they mine from people. Google maps tracking people when they explicitly turned tracking off comes to mind.YouTube is doing something rather similar, why do you need to know my location? Why do you need to know my contacts? Why do you need to know my purchase history? Why do you need to know my browsing history? Not my just YouTube browsing history but my browsing history outside of YouTube? The YouTube app itself is great, tons of content, good informative videos, entertaining ones, music, its got it all. But its business practices and how it treats its customers and content creators is downright exploitive and disgusting. Ive already mentioned the privacy violations, but lets go on to some of the other issues. YouTube seems to think that censorship is good, and that they can demonetize a video that violates their ever changing rules. Yet they can still place ads on those video and receive income from them. If the video wasnt suitable for advertisements due to its content, then why is YouTube able to monetize it for themselves? I dont think its due to the content being inappropriate. Its YouTube stealing from its content creators. Whom they think shouldnt have a say in how YouTube runs. Reminds me of Uber now that I think about it. Someone says a curse word? Demonetized. Someone shows a firearm? Demonetized. Someone doesnt agree with YouTube? Demonetized. But hey YouTube can still profit from those videos anyways. Honestly I believe that should fall under theft of intellectual property. If the content creator cant receive the benefits, then neither should YouTube. Dont like it? Perhaps lessen your ever tightening grip? Im in full support of preventing pornography, gore, and other inappropriate things to be shown on YouTube. However, when you put out ads showing and heavily implying things of a sexual nature, well it seems to be hypocritical. Its almost as if you dont actually care about your rules, so long as you make money. Last issue I will mention is your allowing of the removal of the likes/dislikes. I understand comment sections can sometimes get out of control and need to be removed. However, likes and dislikes are a way for the consumer to know if a video is good or bad. Removing it prevents us from knowing if the video were watching is legitimate, or if its a colossal waste of our time. YouTube will still get that ad revenue though, even if you wasted 10-15 minutes of your time. In my opinion, google and YouTube are a monopoly. Theres no other place on the internet for this type of content. Due to this they have abused their position time and time again. Whether it was cracking down on something they disliked or simply for the sake of greed. No company should have a monopoly on a service nor should they treat peoples lives as a commodity to be bought and sold for profit. We already pay for your services with the ads, you do not need to steal our personal information on top of that. Why 3 stars? They get 1 star for the content, which they dont actually create. 2 stars so that people who dont go to the extremely negative reviews can see this. Do your own research, and really look into how horrible of a company or rather monopoly they are"
"One of the worst apps in the App Store. This is one of the absolute app and service there is. They should he honest and just call it an advertisement app. Not only is Google spying on everyone and sell our information for some mega bucks, but they play stupid ad after ad after ad. YouTube now has more ads than an advertisement agency. When an ad comes up mid roll I just stop watching. And to top it off, to subscribe is more expensive than Netflix, HBO, or pretty much any movie/streaming service. Greed at its best Perhaps they should have different prices for different services. I own over 5,400 songs. I buy my music, not rent it. Run out of money and kiss your music bye bye. Therefore I dont care for anyones music service. Why should I pay for something I dont need or use? Oh that is right, I remember now, Googles crazy greed But I am happy to say that I have cut back my use of Youtube by at least 90 to 95%. Some days I don\'t use it at all. And trust me, if feels good And top to it off now in order for me to log in to any Google app or service, Google wants me to give them my cell phone number. Funny Google, do you honestly think that I am going to provide you with my number? You have got to be kidding me Google, the most powerful spy company that collects and sells people\'s personal information with complete disregard to privacy wants my number. Haha Yeah right  And if anyone reading this (which will most likely disappear from the reviews) think that Google respects your wishes when you change your privacy settings, you\'ve got to wake up from that fantasy. Seriously Google, stop the spying on people and stop kidnaping peoples accounts only because you want more personal information of your users so that you can better keep track of them and sell that information. And for those who think that they don\'t care about companies such a Google and Facebook spying on them because they have nothing to hide, I will leave you with a quote from an USA hero, Edward Snowden: \Saying that you don\'t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide it\'s no different than saying you don\'t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. It\'s a fundamentally un-American principle. And more than nationalism, more than what this country is about, it\'s a deeply antisocial principle. Because rights are not just individual, they are collective, and what may not be of value to you today may have value to an entire population, an entire people, or an entire way of life tomorrow. And if you don\'t stand for it, then who will?\"
"Immoral use of data. Google has a complete disregard for the privacy of their users. They are taking advantage of the ubiquity of their product to misuse data collected by their own algorithm and from other online sources to increase viewing time. I&#39;m tired of seeing video recommendations that are clearly based on my activities all over the internet. It&#39;s creepy and invasive, and you know it. Shame on you"
"Bad Google - No Privacy for YouTube. One of the few Google apps that has had an update requiring them to disclose their privacy practices. I have to say even with the expectation that theyd be up to no good with my data, I am shocked at how much they use that I am not ok with. Shame on you Google and YouTube. Apples privacy choices cannot come soon enough and I cant wait to chop the you know what off of YouTube apps Trojan horse invasion into my life"
Security. The privacy policy of YouTube is great

"Wake up about google/youtube, people. No one else minds how Google is trying to control your life more and more? I wont get started on how they track your every move, record your every move, log your every keystroke, and compile your every purchase for their schemes and sell that information to who knows for marketing purposes. They purposely manipulate their YouTube website so that you cant use it on a phone so you are forced without choice to use their ad laden, DATA MINING APP that is constantly siphoning your personal information for its advertisers and other maniacal schemes. They dont want you to use the website so you cant use your ad blockers to block their ads and trackers (which I do, and will continue to do) and make the website unreliable and unable to even load live events. Well Id rather just go back to not using YouTube at all instead of being muscled into this horrible app and buying their made up, premium features and subscriptions. Goodbye Lol"
YouTube. Im writing this review and giving it 5 stars so that hopefully the app developers will pay attention to what I have to say. Because sooner or later they will understand the importance of peoples Privacy The biggest problem with this app is its always tracking your searches and it does it behind your back so to speak. The settings are very confusing considering you have to log into Google every time and even then no matter how you set your privacy they still track everything you search given out your information to unwanted entities and hacker websites. I have use this app for around 3 years and have been hassled with phone call messages and so on. Because this app is giving out my information with out my permission. Its a awesome app to watch videos and gain needed information or just watching videos. But it comes at a cost and thats is your privacy. So if you dont mind having your information gave out to hacker you will love this app . But to be honest the developers could make this app settings much more simpler to control your privacy
"Spying and advertisement at it's best app. Wow, not only does Google (owner of YouTube) doesn't care about people's privacy, as their whole company and products are design for the collection and sales of people's personal information, but they don't like criticism. My review of their lousy YouTube app keeps disappearing. Youtube used to be a good platform. That was until Google took over. Now it has more ads than an advertisement agency. Google took a great idea and flushed it down the toilet with their excessive ads. Ad after ad after ad. They should change it's name from Youtube to AdTube. At the same time, I am thankful that they have let their greed take over. The excessive ads have pushed me to stop using it as much as I once did. I have cut my use of the app by about 90%. I only use it to look up reviews about products I am considering buying. And, a while back I decided to do something, I would not purchase, consume, or use an product that is advertise in YouTube. With the exception of very few products. To my surprise, literally just about every product I see advertise in YT are products I do NOT care for. Products I never have or would never buy. But hey Google, you really need to cut back on ads. In forums around the net people are talking about how YT has been ruined by the excessive ads. Don't you already make enough money from all the spying you do on us? Come in Google, the world knows your are not a company that designs, develops, and sales electronic products. The bread and butter of your company, the money maker, is shamelessly spying in people and selling our personal information. Haven't you seen the documentary A Social Dilemma? Eye opening Perhaps you should develop a little sense of common decency and cut back on the lousy ads. Because as it is, your app and platform is useless. You can't even put out a half decent app. The thing keeps freezing when I try to put a commend. Or if I start typing a commend and then disregard it It gets stuck there. The app needs to be closed and restarted or I have to go to notes and click on a saved link, that open the app and gets it unstuck. This have been going on for years. You still haven't fixed it. So come on, all the spying, all the ads, for what? Nothing good for us, that is what. And go ahead and delete my review again. No problem, I am copying and pasting this one. To repost it and call you out on the advertisement if needed. Oh, I forgot to mention, the latest and greatest from YT, now unless you give them your phone number, they block you from logging into your account. Had to reinstall the YT app and when I tried to log back in it would not let me do it unless I gave them my phone number. What a load of you know what. Seriously Google/YT, seriously? I am glad I hardly use it anymore. Thousands of people are complaining about this abuse from Google. It seems that a lot of people do not want Google to have our numbers. So this is what I did and suggest. Install ad blockers and VPN in your devices that block Google, Facebook, Amazon and others from tracking and spaying on you. Also look for alternative platforms to use. I have not used their search engine for well over 10 years. If I do by accident, like a site directs me, I exit the site and right away delete all cookies and data from my browser. Ad blockers and VPN that hide your IP address work great. Its a small way to pay them back for blocking me from my YT account for not providing then with my number. Hey, its only fair. If I dont use your lousy products, you do NOT deserve to track me or spy on me"

"GIVE US YOUR DATA MUAHAHAHA. App that data mines your phone when you download it and psychologically profiles you. It will figure out what kind of person you are and recommend content that you are most likely to click on, regardless of whether you are clicking on it for healthy or unhealthy reasons. Ie. they will recommend videos that make you angry or upset because you are more likely to watch.   Owned by one of the shadiest tech companies out there. Dont download this unless you cant access youtube on your phone browser or somewhere else. They also intentionally design youtube so it doesnt work as well on non-chrome browsers. Youtube itself is filled with clickbaity disingenuious garbage with the rare quality content now and again. DO WE REALLY NEED TO GIVE UP SO MUCH OF OUR PRIVACY TO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS? I dont think we do. Stop downloading this app and any other google app. There are obviously many other companies doing this kind of thing but right now google has a serious monopoly on many internet services"
"Privacy, efficiency, interface environment. Its obvious that google keeps track of you and listens to you but its gone too personal for me due to how obvious and annoyingly these advertisements target users. Frankly, this turned for an absolutely disgusting and rude experience especially with premium subscription pop ups after closing the app mid video then opening to a pop up i repeatedly say no to.Sometimes even DURING videos with pauses or any interaction you give to the video - they find ways to hit you with annoying and daunting way-too personal ads. Google has turned this interface and environment thats supposed to benefit and comfort the user with efficiency, into a straight up night mare and job of an app with the ridiculous and obviously shady decisions of google"
"Holy Privacy Label. They collect and sell essentially every aspect of my personal life, the only thing Google is missing is a DNA sample. If you value your privacy even in the slightest, dont use YouTube with a signed-in account. Since theyve got the monopoly on internet video hosting, there obviously arent a lot of other choices, but Id rather sacrifice quality of life features than submit to a greedy corporation that relies on selling me and my data"
"Owned by Google, Privacy Nightmare. YouTube collects and stores personal information that is not needed for maintaining and improving the app, instead to sell. Additionally Google is very politically biased, removing the dislike button which can warn viewers on dangerous videos in leu of protecting the official White House account due to the current unpopular Joe Biden administration"

"Good job. In this economy and time that most internet companies are after your money/personal Information, google does a admirable job for keeping my information safeThx"
More ads with with  privacy enabled. EU YouTube/Google are harming us when we turn off their predatory practices. I turned off tracking and now I am penalized with more adsWhen was the last time there was a useful update to the app
Google has privacy problems. The entire company of Google has privacy issues. They collect information from you about you and continue to sell it as their main profit to anybody whos interested about your information. Vimeo a good alternative
A way to give away all your personal info. Why would you use iOS then voluntarily give all your personal info to Google? Use a browser that allows ad blocking if you want to watch YouTube
"Used to be better. Once I liked you tube and had my own page to post videos and watch, save or download them. Now greed has taken over and you have to pay to download, you get plagued with adverts and like most social media you have to watch what you say or do. YouTube is in league with google and can track you or share your data with little or no consent or unaware consent. Also the copyright laws are stupid and you cant upload certain music or films, you could at one time get free films or music but now its just a greedy money making racket like the rest of this cruel money driven insane world banning everything and taking away freedoms bit by bit or charging for the littlest enjoyment. Also I am in my 40s and I was recently asked to prove my age by providing details, I dont wish to provide the details given to watch adult rated content, you tube and google are too nosy and invade peoples privacy rights. Fair enough its to stop someone young watching the wrong stuff but I grew up in the late 70s and 80s and the tv was different then and it was up to parents what we watched and I never knew it to harm anyone.I remade my you tube and just watch survival, archery or some music videos. Not the same as it was and it seems to be getting much crapier.I dont like technology these days, I dont like phones that track peoples location and invade privacy or when you consent to cookies or sharing data, if you ever read it it sends your details to hundreds of companies which in turn can use your data how they want and even sell your data, then you get spammed to bits.Technology seems to be used against us these days"
"Bad Privacy Practices. I knew Google was bad, but Ill stick to using YouTube in the browser with tracker blockers after seeing their ridiculous tracking practices. Thanks apple"
"theres no privacy with google. youtubes recommendations are  just pain awful,"
"Just way too much commercials. As always, many amazing video but too many commercials/ads, many of them targeted  for me  Clearly, they collect data on their users  Im sure it is within what they are legally allowed to do We are far from the free and add free content that we once had.  Of course, I could pay YouTube to make that less overwhelming.  I would also would like YouTube to take a real accountability on the content they share on their platform.  Regardless of what YouTube is doing on this subject (bare minimum until now), they clearly and publicly admitted that they dont think it is their problem.  In the name of Freedom and more importantly cost savings and avoiding any legal problem (bottom line no accountability), YouTube is managing this topic very carefully with the objective to not have to deal with it"
Sensitive information. I dont know why you guys need so much of my personal information linked to YouTube its honestly a violation of my privacy
"Absolute lack of privacy. It would be great if paid YouTube premium had zero knowledge policy included, every single google service has terrible privacy policies"

I&#39;m tired of seeing video recommendations that are clearly based on my activities all over the internet. It&#39;s creepy and invasive, and you know it. Shame on you.Also, the app has started automatically removing a great many comments with specific words or phrases, many of which over seemingly arbitrary, innocuous things that virtually nobody would be offended by. Its really irritating trying to figure out how to phrase something objectively harmless that might set off their idiotic censorship bot. On top of that, the user gets no notification about removal or record of the comment, so any long messages youve put a lot of thought into simply vanish"
"Security and privacy. YouTube is a great app and you can get information very easily and quickly.  Just have some security and privacy concern after 18th May 2018 regarding GDP act.  Who can get my data (search history, location history etc.?This is main question and nobody like to share his location history or search history to any body or organisation. I think its a crime to share your privacy to any organisation or anybody with out your permission. Otherwise YouTube is great app and I love it"
"Uninvited censoring. As if obnoxious ads have not been enough, Google have decided to become the judge of what their users are entitled to watch, even if it concerns mere historical videos - now one must sign in - just because Google wants to track you and your personal preferences in the name of being &#34;politically correct&#34;, you know. &#34;Do no evil?&#34;. Please spare us. Yeah, do not evil to your shareholders"
"espionage. Be careful... youtube is notorious, like Google, in watching and tracking every move you make.  Google and  YouTube are related.  I was told they monitor you consistently because theyre told to.  There actually is NO privacy these days and it will get worse.  Everything is going to potThis is my personal opinion about YouTube.  I will inactivate my membership"
"The great compromise. We all use YouTube because of its vast trove of content. Nobody with any technical acumen will rate this app as good. In the world of mobile, this app is a miscarriage of ethics to the user. But this is Google, which is notorious for being anti-consumer and its abuses of privacy. Among a litany of anti-consumer functions in this app, Ill name a few big-ticket items that are particularly glaring: No Picture in Picture option, even if you pay for premium. Likely because this forces users to stay within the environment; every ad dollar squeezed to the maximum. Default to low-resolution video. This is totally backhanded and likely a tactic to save bandwidth for users on limited data plans so more ads can be viewed. You are screwing your consumers by doing this. Period. The recent update further obscured bandwidth usage by eliminating the resolution options with vague descriptions intended to keep users using minimal bandwidth to allow more room for ads. And yes, the ads. Everybody hates YouTubes ad practices. Theyre invasive and aggressive. Paying the premium will alleviate this, but the interface remains structured entirely to keeping the user contained in the environment and from dividing their attention to other content in their device while using YouTube. Users, beware the permissions this app requires. An alternate option is to just run the mobile web page and better protect your privacy. This app is puritanical and invasive. I come for the content, and hate this app and company for everything else it stands for"
"There are ongoing issues around safety on YouTube. I have experienced severe and extreme bullying on a YouTube channel. I had all my privacy breached and was threatened with blackmail, extortion and deathNo action was taken, no one was reprimanded and no one was available to speak with over the phoneThe process for addressing these concerns are not adequately address by YouTube.There needs to far more monitoring of channels to do with crime and prisons. In some instances, YouTube can be argued to be contributing to the moral, and social decay of our societies by not having more control over content. This is just my opinion"
"Privacy is important,. however, i really love that i can get info about subjects that i just dont want to live without.You Tube, has always been great.  I could not have lived without it, even before Google bought it.  Thanks guys, a lot."

Kids privacy. This new privacy thing on youtube is so stupid because I cant save certain things to playlists and the multiplayer stops working.

I guess I can pay google to not use my data for ads or an ad blocker. I recommend an ad blocker"
Google sells your data for millions  f them. They also censor anything thats truth.  Every Google App will get a 1 star from me  every time
Stepping stone to fascism. Stop censoring unpopular speech. I advise that the employees at google take a course on us constitutional law and business ethics. Privacy and civil rights should be taken way more seriously at google concerning consumers and workers
"Ads, ads, and more ads. The user experience of YouTube is going down the drain as the company focuses on a freemium profit model. The whole app is just nothing but ads. Ads in the videos, ads beneath the videos, you even have to tap on a button just to hide the ads to get to a videos comments.Ive noticed YouTube has stopped updating their app ever since Apple made it mandatory to report user privacy information in the App Store. YouTube wont be required to publish that information until their next update, so theyre being totally opaque about how your information is being used. Typical of an untrustworthy monopolistic big tech company"

"The politics of algorithms and private space. At some point, its inescapable that platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are a part of the global commons. Much of the content on YouTube is incredible. Ive learned more through my inquiries on this platform than I have through any medium Ive encountered since I left grad school. It is, however, inappropriate for private platforms to have too much influence over content, censorship, and any other considerations as it relates to freedom of expression. I appreciate what YouTube has offered, but there are clear instances where YouTube fails in what it chooses to sensor, as well as how its algorithms are constructed, pushing certain dispositional agendas. Its important to note that the solution here is not simply rooted in the first amendment or the US. Rather, as I suggested earlier, how freedom of expression, freedom of the press, etc. is negotiated must be renegotiated in the public spaces on the newly emerging transnational and potentially global public spaces. For now I do embrace YouTube in its present form, but there are clear concerns, as enumerated by commentators like Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, the new left, and the new right. Some of the critiques are spurious and sophomoric. Others are substantial, and we cannot afford to dismiss them. Ironically, once history gains traction, it cannot be stopped. As institutions like YouTube curb certain veins of expression, newly emerging transnational and potentially global spheres emerge through dialectical möbius twists"
"Google is a scam. Google is garbage. They track everything you do and share all your personal info. YouTube is a joke, ads are ridiculously played over and over"
"Stop the ruination. Every update since youtube was acquired by google has just made it worse. Greed is bad. Stop asking me to give you my data on multiple apps just so you can quadruple dip on selling it, youtube music YouTube YouTube premium youtube red etc, this is insane and completely unnecessary. And stop asking me to turn on notifications, if I want them on I will put them on. I do not need multiple banners asking me whenever I open a page It is bad enough posters ask on every video. Remove the stupid auto pause instead of keep making it shorter Do the job you are supposed to with complaints if they are not accurate then restore the video (supernatural anime from official channel lost sound cause of copyright claim but they did have copyright of it and it still was not restored years later, just as a an example.) stop with the over abundance of ads Absolutely none of your tactics make me want to give you anything, in fact not only do I not want that but many of your advertisers wind up loosing potential customers from all the aggressive ad practices. Not that any of this matters since consumer care is nonexistent in google and affiliates"
"YouTube should pay you for your data. I really enjoy YouTube, however its rather sneaky that google is mining user data and selling it to advertisers. It really galls me that they dont pay me anything in return for selling my data to unknown clients. They are making billions of dollars in the dark"
Google is evil. YouTube would get five stars if it was still independent. Google wants your data just like Facebook and all the other garbage dystopian companies

"2 ads every 3 minutes? Way too much. Age verification? Lol yeah yeah. 2 ads run every 3 minutes forcing you to lose any concentration u had on what u were watching. Google picking pockets left and right. Money from ads money from views money from subscriptions its no longer a streaming service its a money collecting machine its way too annoying to ever consider joining to end all that nonsense. In a 1 hour long video youre now on expected to watch around 40 ads.Also the age verification thingy where they ask for a credit card or ID, weirdly enough this happens when I try to watch videos criticizing certain corrupt governments, making me feel fairly certain my details will end up with that same gov. So its not enough YouTube is censoring what you can see or say, robbing you blind at every turn, bombarding you with forced ads every 3 minutes. Collecting and selling your personal data, but now YouTube is playing Israeli Pegasus style game with your personal data, and going as far as trying to verify your identity for certain not really age related material. You can watch a murder without this age verification,  but get near certain governments and anyone criticizing them, and you risk having YouTube handing you over on a silver platter. Some of these age verified restricted videos work when I use vpn, meaning theyre intentionally fishing for the identity verification for viewers in certain locations, rather than being really about age as falsely claimed by YouTube. Now google is nothing but another Facebook. Try BRAVE browser, zero ads, much better privacy, and free, you can actually make money on BRAVE if you CHOOSE to watch ads"
Restricting free speech is not Right. YouTube is too busy restricting information than promoting it. By restricting information you limit an individuals personal right to evaluate the information they are given by both sides. It is a shame that Im watching YouTube less and less because of it. I dont wish to be told what to think and its completely un-American

Everything about YouTube is all about data collection, offering up click bate rather than valuable content, serving up frequent countless annoying ads, and constantly nagging you to give Google your money for their premium services enabling them to collect even more personalized data. Look into Dtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc. and avoid Googles annoying offering whenever possible. With each change Google makes it just gets worse"
"Spyware. Clearly, Google is spying on my internet searches and then regurgitating YouTube videos to me based on their espionage.  I do not appreciate their intrusion into my privacy"
"YouTube uses your data, censors you and . Most political app there is. Run by horrible people who do not respect channel creators, users or the rights of good citizens. I am praying a better platform makes YouTube obsolete"
"Spying and advertisement at it\'s best app. Wow, not only does Google (owner of YouTube) doesn\'t care about people\'s privacy, as their whole company and products are design for the collection and sales of people\'s personal information, but they don\'t like criticism. My review of their lousy YouTube app keeps disappearing. Youtube used to be a good platform. That was until Google took over. Now it has more ads than an advertisement agency. Google took a great idea and flushed it down the toilet with their excessive ads. Ad after ad after ad. They should change it\'s name from Youtube to AdTube. At the same time, I am thankful that they have let their greed take over. The excessive ads have pushed me to stop using it as much as I once did. I have cut my use of the app by about 90%. Hey Google, you really need to cut back on ads. In forums around the net people are talking about how YT has been ruined by the excessive ads. Don\'t you already make enough money from all the spying you do on us? When it comes to tour app, you can\'t even put out a half decent app. The thing keeps freezing when I try to put a commend. Or if I start typing a commend and then disregard it It gets stuck there. The app needs to be closed and restarted or I have to go to notes and click on a saved link to a YT video, that opens the appa and gets it unstuck. This have been going on for years. You still haven\'t fixed it. So come on, all the spying, all the ads.. And go ahead and delete my review again. No problem, I am copying and pasting this one. To repost it and call you out on the advertisement if needed. Oh, I forgot to mention, the latest and greatest from YT, now unless you give them your phone number they block you from logging into your account. Had to reinstall the YT app and when I tried to log back in it would not let me do it unless I gave them my phone number. What a load of you know what. Seriously Google/YT, seriously I am glad I hardly use it anymore. Thousands of people are complaining about this abuse from Google. It seems that a lot of people do not want Google to have our numbers. So this is what I did and suggest. Install ad blockers and VPN in your devices that block Google, Facebook, Amazon and others from tracking and spaying on you. Also look for alternative platforms to use. I have not used their search engine for well over 10 years. If I do by accident, like a site directs me, I exit the site and right away delete all cookies and data from my browser. Ad blockers and VPN that hide your IP address and work great. Its a small way to pay them back for blocking me from my YT account for not providing them with my number. Hey, its only fair. If I dont use your lousy products, you do NOT deserve to track me or spy on me"
Use it then lose it. YouTubes fascist censorship practices are horrifying. Use it for the worthwhile things you can while putting money into growing free speech platforms that have integrity and dont steal your data to try to further the control of big tech. Its time to break these monsters into manageable pieces and take back our privacy and our first amendment rights
"Let me use my own stuff. The ads in the middle of videos aside from everywhere else are one thing, but you really wont let me choose the private browser I already have installed for external links instead of a Google-owned option I dont want on my phone? It doesnt even let you copy them. Simple fact guys. If I dont use your browser, Im probably not going to use it, so forcing that option is pretty narcissistic. YouTubes political demonization issues are enough without them not letting you use YOUR OWN PHONE the way YOU want to"
Consorship. YouTube is not the best social media platform. They started this downhill journey by collecting our personal data and using it for their own agendas and ads and AI behavioural data collection. They live and breath personal data collection. Youtube encourages extremists and extremism by limiting our access to info that doesn&#39;t challenge our opinions but rather push us to the extreme. We saw that clearly during the trump era and we still see it trough white supremacy groups.Youtube has showed time and time again a bias when it come to dealing with my fellow Muslim and Arab community. Censoring content thats very relevant to our causes. Their pro-Israeli approach was clear in the event that are happening recently in Palestine and Gaza. Blocking content that show the Israeli gov. War crimes and horror attacks against the Palestinian civilians. Limiting the access to posts and videos about the subject represents limiting  free speech rights. I cant wait for a better alternative app that protects my personal information and opinion and respect free speech rights
"Who needs a 1st Amendment anyway?. The content I find on YouTube is great. But the vague guidelines for what is allowed and the arbitrary enforcement is subjective and seems to be pushing the agenda that Google/YouTube want you to hear. Its a private company and can make all the rules they want, but the day I find a platform that hosts a large amount of unrestricted opinions, is the day every last Google product is deleted. You track our phones, our browser histories, and who knows what else. Just let me hear from real people and their opinions without you deleting their content because you dont like it or demonetize channels with 1 million+ subscribers because they dont toe the line. Shame"
"YouTube censorship is communist. Exactly what I said, YouTube is censoring too much free speech, it has turned communist and that is a blatant disregard for our constitution, shame on you Google and Youtube. You should be prosecuted for obstructing freedom of speech. I wont be using your services anymore, in fact I don&#39;t use Google because it tracks and monitors your every move. USE Duck Duck Go instead, it keeps things private"

Why?. Why do I have to download a kids YouTube for privacy thats not needed Im 19 and I dont have kids I want to watch videos swipe it down to continue to listen and search for another video why does it have to be difficult youtube like what the heck.But also its my account that I have had for a long time why cant I even change the privacy on my own account its not an option
"Allowing our corporate overlords into your home. Great way to sell your personal interests, political leanings, hobbies, and music choices to the google corporation- for free.  As this information is then sold to advertisers google can continue to buy our politicians, influence our laws, expand its monopoly, and cram down their corporate opinions on any user- for free.  Also if you decide to become a YouTuber for profit you can look forward to being censored, shadow banned, harassed, and eventually removed if you violate the rules that are sometimes hidden or altered without warning. Which means you will be working for YouTube to build their platform and increase the user base- for free.  Not to worry though, YouTube is not a publisher of content, it is only a platform so they arent legally responsible for any of the content on their website. Even if they act like one all the time.  So yeah go ahead and get the app its- for free"
Censorship. Tsk tsk tsk YouTube. Pretty dumb to start censoring people for posting factual data
What privacy?. Take serious for once the terms of service of YouTube. These guys have NSA status over you
"App works great, but harvests too much personal info. The app functions all fine and well (except for transitioning to dark mode during use, but I can live with that). My problem is with the personal info it collects and retains for advertisers, despite my best efforts to curb this. I have a Google account that has zero personal information, not even my name. However my YouTube ads are still targeted all the way down to the county I live in, with no options to stop it. Im avoiding the app entirely as long as this practice remains in place"
"For youtube. Dont like what you are doing with I dont trust you, my privacy. You pick and choose who has a voice, decide what contentdont trust you I can see and stifle I free speech. The only reason I use youtube is I hate TV I do not trust you, it is obvious you support the extreme left and their agenda. You support communism and that is not American. You take people off your Chanel when they tell the truth. I hope you get yours when the time comes, I believe you will.and what I see on it more. Now that I have said this I believe youtube is going to mess with me"
Keep my comment. YouTube is connected with Google  it shares my data with four pages of Google company sponsors its like letting a stalker a rapist a paedophile in your house to take care of your children
Bad company. Google only wants your info to make more money and censor what you can watch not actually provide anything
"Privacy invasion. Thanks Google for selling my private information to advertisers, truly loving that my address, email, mobile number and location (as well as many other PII) is sold to the highest bidder.Google, Facebook and others like them are a scourge on this planet"
"Privacy for $ - to bag great content?. Google - really, how much would it cost you to give us our privacy?How much do you really earn, fattening and selling our personal files? Whats it cost you to drive every street in the nation, photographing our homes and how many tons of greenhouse gas do you spill building your Real Estate Agent Special files?Heres the deal - and thanks for BEGINNING to dump lies from your files that have people killing themselves with intestinal worm killer or shooting up bleach - absolute snake oil instead of taking s couple of shots to save themselves-and the world, from COVID-19 - thats a startHow much would it cost you to a) charge the producers the cost of their channels - the cost of those data files you keep (and -cost of targeted/all advertising) to provide your free services and still make a fair profit?How much would you charge me to erase, as it appears anything related to my searches or the videos I choose to watch?I want to PAY to access You Tube - not necessarily to lose the commercials, but if the price is affordable , Id pay that too - a one-time fee to blow any data related to me off your system and an annual anonymous Search/Academic Library/You Tube subscription (others will pick and choose their own packages and options).Yep, Ill buy my service - probably for more than you make selling data and targeting ads.Youve done it - youve managed to create the right to deny me your service and point a gun at me saying meyour privacy will cost you, oh say $100 for an on-line search, $200 for on-line and backup/dated information, $450 to reclaim, or build useless dummy info to wipe you from every firm weve sold your file to, a bit more to guarantee youre wiped from the mashed files theyve built and sold on, to the nth party.Get it now before we convince enough people how dangerous youve become and legislate against you. Sure, you can fund campaigns and buy the few crooked  of our representatives, but they still need votes to be elected.What would happen if a PAC bought your full files, then mailed those files to the subjects? You would be toast in 48 hours.So, how about it? Offer us anonymity for cash while infotheft, packaging and mashing still isnt a crime.Ive got no misdeeds, crimes or bad habits to hide, I just dont want another million spam calls if I get interested in looking up a subject.I dont want political ads targeted and manipulated based on videos I choose to watch. What was it Ray Bradbury said in his intro to The Martian Chronicles, bout how people have the right to be what and who they are and be left alone?10 stars for range of content - which could be expanded by pointing and (option-anonymously) other servers where the data exists already, -10 for your disgusting business practices"

Downhill. Data privacy very sus and the censorship is apparent
"Whats worse than apps selling your personal information?. YouTube videos made for kids that you cannot watch with mini player. Seriously, how on earth does that protect kids??? And dont say because then kids will continue to keep scrolling through other videos. Worst of all, you cant even comment on the video to tell the maker that you cant watch it on multiplayer so its just a pain in the SENSORED, as we wouldnt want to scar the kids reading these reviews for life. Terrible. YouTube please change this or at least disable the kids protection on accounts that do not have kids watching"
"youtube is awful and some day more people will realize. that youtube started out decent but like most things in culture today, all that matters is eyeballs and nothing else. the relentless catering to the viewer can always be justified as good cuz it makes things easier and better for u, but in the long run its only to keep u coming back to youtube over and over and over again. so much so that ur psychologicallly addicted to watching things while exposing urself to ads. dont like ads? no problem. pay your way around them. its not muchjust a little bit of money every month forever or until u remember to cancel. also in this rant id like to mention that without any notice, youtube deleted all of my videos from my account. and theres nobody to talk to or help me get them back. sure, i have them saved elsewhere, but the fact that nobody can help me get them back to my youtube account really is incredible. youtube is massive and makes a lot of money yet cant offer any actual human to help me with their service. why is that? in conclusion, i have significantly decreased my watching of youtube cuz its really quite stupid and an unhealthy trap to get u addicted. there are more posers and wannabes than i could ever imagine on youtube these days and i want nothing to do with those folks. sure, there are some good things out of youtube, like learning and helping people, but the overall design of the youtube service is absolutely wretched and twisted due to ads and playing on the human psyche for exploitation. not to mention censorship and arbitrary monitoring of information, which i didnt even get intoeff youtube for what it has become. im glad i didnt fall victim to this service. i almost did but saw the light. eff you youtube"
"A huge spying joke. This app is a joke. So many ads, (usually 1-2 before a video) and bad recommendation systems. But the real issue here is your RIDICULOUS marketing practices. I mean I looked at what data you collect from people, and boy, it wasnt pretty.So if Im right, you collect people names,phone numbers, emails, purchase history, and even your LOCATION. I know you need to target ads for marketing but holy cow thats a lot of data just for one app. I mean its like your spying to see what were doing on the internet and our browsing history. That just scares me. Your darn customers need to realize their getting too close for comfort. PROBLEM 1: advertising revenue There are way too many ads with YouTube. Stop. Please. I mean 30 seconds in your video-AD 2 more seconds-ADVERTISEMENT Oh yeah and IT DOES NOT STOP FROM THERE. This is a mountain of greed and the want for money. And they dont fix any bugs or glitches. Their just working on more ads or crappy content.Problem 2: Marketing practicesRefer to the introduction.^"
"Too much data collecting and censorship. Somehow, YouTube knows everything about you and the commercials to you make you feel that you have no privacy at all. Try looking up some conservative news, biblical, or American history, YouTube only shows bias videos to what you are looking up. In fairness, you can find what you are looking for but its way harder than finding liberal news, anti Christian, and anti American videos. Bias"
"Censorship and anti-privacy practices. Abusive censorship, whether its content or comments. Youtube has an anti-privacy terms &amp; conditions and behaviour. Too many ads and you still cant see the channels non-video posts on iPad. Theres no excuse for not releasing it for s multi billion dollar company"
Use anything else. YouTube is shameless in the way they collect data from every user through their phones microphone. Im sick and tired of having random videos pop up in my recommended about things I talked about the previous night. Their algorithms are terrible and I wouldnt be surprised if they started showed three ads in front of videos in the near future
"Censorship TM,. I don&#39;t really care, YouTube has a right to deny service, but the one star review is because of multiple things1 - FormattingThe formatting style changes so rapidly, it&#39;s hard to get used to. I like the new comments section thing, but the old format of YouTube was ovjectively better and easier to use.2 - Data TrackingEven when i&#39;m signed out, or on incognito, even when i have search history and clear on pause, and unchecked all my google account tracking boxes, even when using a vpn, I still get the same annoying ads which I know are targetted to me. Based on videos I&#39;ve watched, yt never forgets.3. Censorship of Channels Youtube&#39;s employees disagree withThere are a myriad of conservative &amp; other right-leaning channels that Youtube demonitizes and takes down for no reason. An example: Louder with Crowder. It&#39;s a conservative show where the host delivers news information, commentary, and occasionally hosts change my minds. youtube has demonitized him and shut down his youtube account simply for his political views. im not sugarcoating this in any way, check for yourself.Youtube has eh formatting, constantly tracks your data, and censors content creators it disagrees with who havent violated anything, only proves the creators points tbh lol.That is why I&#39;m giving this app a one-star review"
"Unsafe application. If you look at the Data Linked to You area, almost everything is connected, and this is owned by google which got sued for selling your information. Now, it is a good app to watch videos but not for safety of your info"
Privacy security threat. YouTube hasnt been patched in months becauseGoogle refuses to disclose how they harvest your personal data via Apple guidelines
"Lack of Privacy. Recently YouTube have enforced a age verification process as they deem some of the videos to be not suitable for under 18 years of age, they do have YouTube kids however they wish to frustrate everyone else and steal there data on the original platform, they ask for ID cards/driving license, passports and bank details/credit cards This is to establish your age but at what risk? Do we just start handing out these forms of sensitive data to prove to a video upload service just to prove we can watch how to peel a banana on YouTube I think not This is a major privacy breach of our data and Apple dont seem to be doing anything about this despite their privacy enforcements surrounding Collection of data"
The privacy policy and expensive premium. Youtube premium is too expensive for what you get. Just give us background audio and Picture in Picture without all the extra stuff that most people dont want. 4.99 a month for no ads and the features people is not much to ask.Also very disappointed in the tracking for ads. Just give me ads without tracking me Im not buying your products anyway
Harassing. Harassing viewers with lots of ads - why? You already make your money selling our data
stop deleting views. stop deleting views off of videos. Yall sit here and collect the money from all the ads while we are watching but then turn around and steal the views and watch time from the content creators and thats wrong. YouTube treats their creators like sht when theyre the ones lining YouTubes pockets
Too much censorship. Censors videos bad for privacy since its owned by google and last but not least YOUTUBE SHORTS CRASH THE ENTIRE APP
App with problems and steals info( oh I mean protects). I use YouTube so I can over look some of its many flaw like its copyright system the way it handles stuff and so for but recently there has been a requirement on the AppStore to show the information that the app needs to work I mean the only reason Im still using it in general is that there no other way to watch these same videos not to mention for most of the stuff it collects theres no real justification except that they sell your information on the pretense of using it to personalize adds if you dont believe me check out literally any app owned by google and youll see the same huge list of your information it uses like for example why the heck does it need access to your contacts seriously can that be explained
"Feel vulnerable. Increasingly, YouTube makes me feel vulnerable and hacked. I long for the good ole days when YouTube seemed to be an open, worldwide community video billboard. Can wait to see what they submit re: privacy on the next update Hmmm"
"YouTube Customer Opinion. Videos are not what they seem and people are being allowed to alter videos in a way to hide individuals reporting of events. Its a shame that this is how customers are treated and it is allowed in this country where freedom of speech use to exist. Also, my recommendations in my feed always are the opposite of my interest, at least if your going to use my personal information stop giving what I dont watch"

Good but steals your data. YouTube is great but they use it to collect information on you and sell you and your information to advertisers
Sign in forcing me to expose personal data to google.com. The man is watching
This app listens to your conversations. Listens to your conversations even when your phone is locked. Also displays terrible content over and over despite my attempts at hiding them and refreshing.Main video feed consistently and repeatedly display grossly inappropriate ads titled how to spy on others messages And how I made thousands from sitting at home. Clearly YouTube has no conscience in regards to filtering out spam advertisements and would rather just make money at the expensive of vulnerable users
Update Wont Let Me Login With Yahoo Anymore-Lost Everything On My Account. Opened the app this afternoon to find that YouTube logged me out and now requires that you log in with Google and give permission for both Google and YouTube to share all your data. As if the censorship and ads every 30 seconds werent bad enough... I hope Apple forces them to push an update to combat this awful practice or removes them from the App Store altogether
"1 star for listening. YouTube should not listen to our private conversations- its so bizZare that we talk about matresses and we get matress adverts, we talk about glasses- we get glasses adverts etc etc. Where is our privacy ?"
"Access to Everything. I love how YouTube allows access into everyones world. Wether educational, personal, entertainment You tubers have access to everyones platforms and experiences I cant get enough"
Censorship and privacy. Censorship and privacy of personal information are both issues that youll have to deal with using this app
"Too Much Corporate Control. The app itself is very useful, the parent company Google is oppressive to free speech and does an extremely poor job implementing content moderation. Moderation relies on computer algorithms, random unsubstantiated accusations from end users, and rampant and excessive copyright violations among other things. Since Google became involved it has become a complete disaster, and this type of data collection should absolutely be illegal. Overwhelming them with litigation may be the peoples last recourse against their blatant attack on our first amendment rights"
"Shameful age restriction requests. Now in order to watch age restricted videos, Google wants either a credit card, a driving license or a passport. This is just an utterly shameful way to try to get us to give up more of our personal data. NO WAY GOOGLE"
"The app reflects the unscrupulous company. Its so pathetic how Google keeps trying to gather more and more information about people for their own greedy desires. Cant log in into my account unless I give them my phone number. That will never happen, which takes out many of the features of most apps and the Google platform.They claim that it is to verify my identity, Google must really think that we are stupid, because just because I enter my phone number it does not mean that they know who really is trying to access the account. How could they if I have never given them my number? Its ridiculous Bottom line is that Google makes apps that have a lot of issues and may be that is because they are more worried about spying on us as much as possible instead on concentrating on making the apps work properly.For example, I do a search for a specific type or business and in the results Google Maps shows you businesses that are not related in any shape or form to what I am looking for. Or I am looking for a business ir type of business in a different part of the country or different country, so I zoom in the specific area I want to search and it goes back to my area and shows me businesses near to my location. No Google, if I zoom in in an area it is because that is the area I want to search. And these are only two of the issues. The truth is that Googles bread and butter money maker is the collections and sales of peoples personal information. Not allowing people to log in unless they provide their phone number is an effort to gain a vital piece of information for each person. So many things revolve around our numbers and e-mails now days, that getting your phone number is a must. Well, I refuse to provide a such unscrupulous company my number"
Privacy and settings its just too much confusion. This has turned into such a hard website to work I am astonished.I havent used it in a while and it is so hard to give yourself privacy its ridiculous way too much information man.We as the users should be able to easily change things we want without all these instructions that nobody knows just make it simpler
"MASSIVE CENSORSHIP. YouTube is updating their algorithms regularly to censor Conservatives and Truth tellers  Google is no longer a data base that you can find truth and facts .. They are burying the facts and truth in their data base  They are complicit in stealing the presidency and giving it to career criminal Joe Biden  They are NOT a public platform and they need section 230 removed so they are held liable for their deceit of the American People . These high tech companies such as YouTube/Google , Facebook and Twitter are being run by globalist criminals and they must be stopped to reap the benefits of a better world "
"Why. Okay. Heres where were at. This app has been on my phone for a long time. And to be honest, Ive never really had a problem with it. But then, this magical thing called COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act) came about. Now dont get me wrong, I am all for protecting our children on the internet. What I have a problem is that why does an adult, who just as a side note is paying for YouTube premium, has to deal with restrictions on content made for kids? And not only that, but half the time the content isnt made for kids I ran into an issue the other day where I was watching a family guy video, and I wanted to search for another one. But then I get a pop up at the bottom of the screen that reads: Miniplayer is turned off on content made for kids.  What is going on here?How does something as simple as the miniplayer, which is simply a smaller window for the video you were already watching, collecting data on anybody? Any support forum or thread I have read simply gives us the runaround: Features such as the miniplayer rely on user data. Okay, we get it, but how? You didnt tell us how it relies on that user data, all you told us is that it does. I, a paying-for-premium adult, would like to not be limited to the same restrictions as a child. At the very least, dont restrict the miniplayer. I know that many of us are frustrated about these new restrictions. And Im sure content creators are even more outraged. But you have to realize that there is a version of YouTube made for kids. The standard edition of YouTube should not have to be like this. Viewers and content creators absolutely share in these frustrations. I do, however, have a solution:The COPPA restrictions apply on signed out, public YouTube. But on accounts of adults that are 18 and older, DO NOT. RESTRICT. THE MINIPLAYER. This way, it can be ensured that children are not watching the content, adults are. Please YouTube, all I want is to be able to search for my next video while finishing up the one I am currently watching. Thats all I ask, and Im sure that many others are asking the same thing. And we are all left scratching our heads while wondering, WHY? We the viewers, and the people who make videos, are what keep your platform running. But these restrictions are placing a tight grip on the user base, and I can guarantee both viewers and content creators will jump ship if this persists. Not just the miniplayer thing, but some of the other restrictions as well. As to what we will jump ship to, I dont know, but it will probably be an opposition video platform designed to fight back on YouTube and Googles baseless restrictions. Thats all I have to say, I speak for the viewers, and the decision on how to act rests in your hands... or your keyboards and monitors, rather... Good day to you"
"I grew up on YouTube this hurts. Been watching YouTube since a kid and it was a place where people shared information and content freely now everything is censored and there is no freedom of speech, talk about the truth and they take you down, search for information on news and all you get is main stream media clips and no personal takes, YouTube is becoming main stream propaganda and it hurts, it used to be for the people now its for the government. What a fall from grace"
"Youtube is garbage. Ui is horrible, staff are horrible and disrespectful, and this app is illegally mining data from your phone. They want to use personal info against you"
"Information, privacy. Blocking what videos we can watch based off their political opinions while claiming that they dont have political bias. GFY"
"Ads. If YouTube isn\'t paying for MY DATA, quit throwing your ADS AT ME"
"Too many ads. Way too many of them.  More ad time than video time.  And they seem to have gotten rid of any form of quality control too because most ads are for scam get rich quick schemes, ads for sites/pages for conspiracy groups, and for health products that havent been tested or approved by the FDA.  Cant skip most of them either.  I rarely use youtube mobile now.  Only on PC with my ad blocker.  Oh and google, before you send your Trolls to shame me for being ungrateful and not watching ads on a free service. Just know that Im still waiting on you to compensate me for all that personal data of mine that youve been stealing for most of my life and selling to god knows who without my consent"
Too much spying. You tube needs to respect people\'s privacy more. Their site operates with impunity towards their users and their watch history
"Very disappointed with you YouTube. I will be deleting this app and finding another platform to watch. I have reached my limit with what Ill put up with. Videos are littered with ads now to the point that theyre unwatchable, on top of the ads, creators are now given the option to have a sponsor which often involves 5-10 minutes of them SPAMMING ME with useless products and services. What a world we live when I have to watch an ad in order to watch ANOTHER ad. I am annoyed that I cant just start a podcast or music video without having to constantly stop what Im doing to fast forward through a long ad or impatiently stare at the screen for 30 seconds, or 5 seconds until I can hit the skip button, which is purposely made extremely small and difficult to select, often resulting in me clicking on the video by mistake taking me to the ads website. If this tactic isnt a scam, it is borderlining it.       And listening to me Every day I see videos relating to things Ive said or talked about throughout the day. It is CREEPY and invasive If I want to watch something on those subjects, I will search it myself. Invading my privacy to recommend certain videos and ads is not the right way to go. I shouldnt have to resort to turning off my microphone in all places in my phones settings.       Bring back the Dislikes This is the icing on the cake. What were you thinking removing that? How do we properly judge the content we are watching when it is impossible to leave any negative feed back. Creators filter out their comment sections, or disable them all together. The only genuine thing we had to go off was the dislike count.       The censorship is getting ridiculous and I just cant support that anymore. So many of my favorite creators constantly not being able to say words and phrases from fear that their video will be removed or demonetized. YouTube grew to where it is today for being a genuine source to spread and obtain information, now it is a biased source skewed in a particular direction with an agenda. YouTube thinks were all idiots, they feed us this crap and expect us to take it without question. This is NOT cool, and Im done supporting it. So much more I could say; very disappointed YouTube. Im done"
"Too much censorship. First off you can not trust YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google on keeping your privacy. They sell and trade your info. Even worse then that, they are fact checking and removing posts they dont agree with and demonetize people they dont like. Ive seen posts that are 100% provably true being called false while nothing from the left (like 4 years of Russia propaganda) gets fact checked. Not one fake story about Trump gets a fact check. If you hate these socialist commie liberals replace Fakebook with WeMe, replace Twitter with Parler, replace YouTube with Rumble, and replace Google with Duck Duck Go. If we all do this we can make a difference and take away the monopoly these liberal tech companies have"
"Too many advertisements. I doubt if YouTube care about our concerns regarding advertising and selling our data, but we are stuck with them until another format or service dethrones them"
Ads. Way too many ads and youtube asks questions that over reach into private lives over who is watching what
"Google is so invasive. Its creepy have invasive Google is for their advertising. If I look up something on my computer, I see it in YouTube ads a day, some time not even a day later. Ill make sure not to do business with those advertisers.Auto playing videos after a search on this app is really not a welcomed feature. How do I turn that off? Dont need vids using my data up"
The privacy policy and expensive premium. Youtube premium is too expensive for what you get. Just give us background audio and Picture in Picture without all the extra stuff that most people dont want. $4.99 a month for no ads and the features people is not much to ask.Also very disappointed in the tracking for ads. Just give me ads without tracking me
Invasion of privacy. When installing YouTube app just know they are violating your privacy.Listening with the phone mic to find personalized content. Thats invasive and not acceptable
"YouTube is political censorship. The censorship on youtube is off the charts. It seems youtube has an agenda of misleading the public on all matters of importance. I hope it goes bust and the managers go to jail for the rest of their lives. Theres much better video hosting platforms that do not censor or sell your information. Support them, boycott youtube and all its ads"
Love to YouTube. Its really nice to have a place where you can be the public you &amp; still be able to have the privacy of you as well
Pedos. Have you heard that YouTube took down the guys video who was exposing PEDOs? Whos team are you on YouTube? Why would you care about the privacy of those people? If you care about those people you should share a similar future to them
YouTube is on the downhill slope. All the YouTube developers can do now is take features away... push more ad space  and subscription services... the bottom line is they continue removing account control features in an attempt to undermine the ability of the user to maintain privacy on apple products and be just another google statistic
"Not bad but not fair if you value privacy. If you arent signed in the app will randomly reset even if you have a video open in the background (not sure what happens if you are signed in, but cant believe the ratings are true if it were to do that). Ive also had it randomly update and reset the video I was watching while I was checking another app. Just because I dont want to either pay or let Google get complete access to my internet history is no reason to have the app work worse than if I use a web browser. Google killed YouTube for$$$ and a lot of people seem to either not have noticed; or not care because theyre getting, or think theyll be able to get, some minimal cut on the profits"
Privacy issues. Why does the YouTube app need access to contacts?
Censorship. I cannot ethically continue to do business with a company that can support suppression of free speech. Big tech has way too much power over the people. Shame on you. You will not mine my marketing data for profit
Censoring info. Who can use YouTube for info when full information is censored?
Update. I was wondering do you guys planning on adding a feature were if your account been hacked . You can transfer your data to your new email. Or a feature were u can transfer your data like all the people you subscribe to an playlist u made to your new YouTube account so u can keep everything. With out starting over . I noticed alot of hacking has been going on with YouTube lately and I feel people will appreciate it if y&#39;all add some new features that will let that feel more secure. Like make a password or a boost of security update. Because I have been noticing that the hackers are going to people email accounts an deactivate there Google accounts and personal information by YouTube. So just wondering do you guys planning on boosting and fixing your security on YouTube so people can feel more secure I appreciate the help y&#39;all gave me on recovering my account. Y&#39;all should also add that on YouTube so people can fix things fast before deactivating there emails. I think you guys Should add the username and password feature because that wouldn&#39;t be connected to the person email An y&#39;all should fix the search feature because Everytime I look up a video nothing new pops up and y&#39;all have allot of sexual stuff popping up And every time I tap on a video that is not inappropriate it won&#39;t let me watch the video please make a update that fix the problem. I noticed a lot of users has also been getting their account hacked recently so just saying that so u guys can improve the security for all users

Google sign in. Google is now requiring sign in to use YouTube. Very frustrating. I cant access watch history without signing in. Google wants to track my views which is intrusive to my privacy. YouTube was much more user friendly before Google starting imposing controls. Googles controls have seriously reduced my use and watch time on YouTube
"Love You Tube but. I love Googles You Tube - but (behold the underlying truth) Im not inclined to PAY for it for a couple of reasons: theyre collecting, nurturing, farming and capitalizing my data on everything I watch - to sell my data, customizing/curating what I see, and thats significantly profitable to them via what they choose to promote, and #2 they could easily and profitably offer a lower cost subscriber plan because they do that. That is all"
Dont be evil. Google is an evil company that steals your information. The ads on this price of crap are ridiculous
PERSONAL DATA COLLECTOR. YOUTUBE APP GOOGLE TAKES CONTROL OF ALL CONTACTS EMAILS TEXT SMS MESSAGES PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED IN THE SMARTPHONE . READ THE ACCESS TO YOU WILL BE GIVING PERMISSION BY DOWNLOADING
Limiting content. YouTube used to be incredible Recent changes have forced me to look elsewhere. I cant imagine how limiting content is a good business decision. As part of a publicly traded company I dont think their actions serve the interest of their shareholders
Sold out to China. Way too many ads and censorship.  Using an ad blocker is a must when watching youtube. Worst of all China pretty much owns them now.  Youtube tracks everything you do and knows everything about you in order to sell and profit off your data.  Thats why they are very sketchy with their privacy policy
"YouTube remarks. For the most part it works very well.  Easy to select full screen mode, other platforms arent so easy.What I am very much against is all the data mining and snooping that YouTube filters back to the mother ship, Google.   Our privacy is gone thanks to money grabbing progressive democrats that own these platforms"
"Meh. Atrocious privacy is paired with subpar user experience, tons of ads and intentionally annoying controls in this really mediocre application. I wish all the good content found a better home"
"Video downloads with ads for non premium. Why not allow non YouTube premium users to save low quality(144p, 360p, 480p) videos with ads. An internet connection could be required to view the saved videos. Some users have a limited data plan. Those users could download videos with ads while connected to WiFi. The cellular connection could be used to download new/updated ads, the ads could then be displayed and finally the user could watch the previously downloaded video. Only downloading ads over cellular would save cellular data, since ads are a small part of the YouTube video. Downloading of HD and 4K video could be restricted to premium users. I think most users would prefer not to use a third party downloader that removes ads. Alphabet loses ad revenue when people use YouTube downloaders. Most people just want to watch the video once. Most people dont rewatch. Why would people download and upload YouTube videos to a piracy website, when they can watch them for free on YouTube? I dont mind watching ads. Streaming YouTube on a 128k connection is frustrating. Most cellular plans lower the data speed once the high speed data limit is reached. Videos stop and start because download rate is not fast enough. People on a slower connection will watch fewer videos and Alphabet will make less ad revenue. If I could preload YouTube videos, I would watch more YouTube videos"
"Advertisement, asking for ID. Why is there so many ads, they annoy me so It puts me off to even buy whats being advertisedWhy on earth would I want to share my private ID to YouTube so they have more saved info about my life"
"Love YouTube but. Politics is ruining everything. Please be a business that its on the side of the consumer... and free speech. I love to listen to both sides of an issue. Ive learned so much from your channel and find it invaluable. But when you show signs of deleting information or content due to individual personal opinions of your executivesThen youre no better than some of the worst people in history.Sincerely, Best Regards, andThank you very much:)"
"Good because of the creators. I pretty much grew up on the internet, and Youtube was a huge part of that. The creators are incredible (if youre looking at the right ones, of course). Although, youtube customer support is awful. Theyre a corporation at the end of the day, but they dont try to actually listen to their community. They know they have a monopoly on the video streaming world, and exploit it hard. At the very least, their UI is very well done. Its been through tons of changes, all for the better. My only complaint on that end is whenever you minimize a video and an info pop-up appears, it goes right where the video was. Then, the more info link goes right over the videos X. So, if you minimize a video and try to close it immediately, half the time youll be sent to safari"
"Uses cell data without clicking video. Still locked in, but successfully found youtube alternatives for movies, music, and 1/2 of news. Reducing private content, but unfortunately not much. No longer use affiliate links.I used to sing youtube praises - unchecked cash grab has tainted"
"This is capitalism. First of all, through testing Ive found that they track your eyes so they know what video you looked at the most on the front page and make those videos show up all the time in recommended when you dont watch them. That is where your money is going, not making it a better device for humans.The website has been around for a while and back when it made no money they werent constantly trying to force top channels with loads of add space. Dont even try when they do things, this black history month was a serious middle finger to minorities. I mean it was a list where it was just popular black YouTubers. Nothing about history, not a real experience, just the bare necessities so google can have all the money, make more then countries and increased several billion dollars under Covid, but that money doesnt need to go to improving the website. Deleted my account"
Censorship and privacy. Censorship and privacy of personal information are real problems
"needs improvement. Theres nothing to stop your incessant data tracking tactics but maybe try improving your ad relevance algorithms so that all your advertisers dollars arent wasted. Google &amp; YouTube both used to rock, but now your in bed with government agencies that do not have Americans best interest first &amp; foremost and that, frankly, have bad track history time &amp; time again"
Meh. The people marking content are grate but the app and YouTube itself are pretty bad you basically only need to know every other streaming place has a warning about cellular data and how much it would use. YouTube doesnt care about it like I said creators good YouTube as the only available platform is bad
"Just too greedy. Hey Google, you make an absolute mint by using and selling my personal data. Yet for add free content on YouTube you want more money. Now watching YouTube is almost like watching commercial tv. How about giving back something to the very people that made you successful? I mean you already dont pay your fair share of tax in any country you operate.P.s. Apple, pay your taxes too"
Privacy. Stop steeling my information/ sharing them
"What makes you think denying my privacy is a good idea?. Youtube, I know your headquarters are very stubborn and your go-to is to give updates no one asked for rather than listening to the creators you constantly screw off unless they&#39;re ones like Markiplier who trip over your delicate egos, but listen. I do not want people being able to see my comment history on any channel, nor do i want to see theirs. It is a useless, gross waste of privacy and you need to find a way to let users turn it off. It was a stupid and ridiculous idea, I don&#39;t know what you were thinking. Do better and listen to the people who pay for you to screw us over on your site"
"My feelings about YouTube. I was extremely pleased with YouTube for the  past years I have used it.  It has given me the chance to view new programs about daily life on Narrowboats, enjoy some great music and very relaxing videos.  But since I  lean to the right politically, they have started trying to censor what content I watch and who I follow to get my news and information.  I find this so unfair and contrary to why this platform was even started.  I and everyone that subscribed should have free choice and the presenters of these programs should be able to voice or say their opinion.  We do not need politically correct policing, that is the problem with the state of the world today Everyone should be able to think for themselves and not be pushed into an ideology that someone else seems to think is better for them.  The left is all about control and sadly  for You Tube, it is being used to stifle free thinking and force feed their personal ideas on all subscribers Am thinking of cancelling my subscription if this continues"
"Best place to watch ads. Tired of commercials on your tv being too short?Tired of billboards on the highway being too sparse?Tired of ads on the radio that dont take up your entire drive to work?Then Try youtubeGaurenteed to give you an add on every video (if not two ) and a friendly popup every other minute asking for your personal info &amp; credit information And best of all, most ads are actually LONGER than the videos you want to watch Finally Im not distracted from these ads by some pesky entertainment I want to enjoy When watching tv, I used to get so annoyed that I had to wait 10-15 minutes between commercials for some stupid show to play. Well, with YouTube, theres now a very high chance that youll never even see the show through the ads Basically the entire site is just commercials, targeted ads, and clawing at your feet begging you to subscribe to YouTube red. Exactly what Ive been looking forWhats that? You wanted to watch a 7 second video on how to operate a fire extinguisher? On giving CPR? On the Heimlich maneuver? HERES 30 SECONDS OF UNSKIPABLE ADDS Oh wait, it said video will play after the ad, but now theres ANOTHER ad Sneaky little YouTube, giving me more ads than I had hoped for  So happy I have something to keep my mind busy for the next minute as my friend who is on fire has a heart attack from choking Oh, you searched places to eat near me on google two weeks ago? On google and not YouTube?Let me just add that search to your recent searches on YouTube, and defiantly NOT use that to recommend you more adds in the future (wink, wink ) Overall, 10/10 would recommend to those who really dont like to watch videos, and just want cooperations shoving advertisements down their throat non stop as obnoxiously as possible. Thanks YTEdit: IT GETS BETTER Now, when you search a video, you wont even see results for videos on your screen Just ads Like, not a single video under results, just 5 ads, and then you scroll past those five ads... then past two more...... THEN you get video results And those adds are... you guessed it... all for things you googled How nifty. P.s. hey YouTube, if you wanna keep making all this money off selling my personal data, Literaly who I am and what makes me me, wanna at least split the profits 50/50? I mean seems fair, as youre selling me without my consent. HMU w/ a backpay check sweetie "
"Why youtube need my physical address. First, thank you apple to make Google reveal their privacy policy. Why on earth google would track my physical address just for using the app This is scary. They know everything about you even when you just install the app and delete it"
"Great platform. Im a fan. YouTube is an excellent platform for free expression. I also know the issue of censorship is a complicated one. And there are some terrible people out there who have no regard for the facts, just their own propaganda. This is the case on the far left and on the far right. But I would rather see less censorship, or at least for censorship to be handled more judiciously. That said, I do appreciate that recently passed laws/policies are taking the safety/privacy of children into account. Just trying to keep my criticism balanced here"
"Free speech Suspression. YouTube is good video platform, but recent removal of Medical Doctors discussing data is terrible.  Does YouTube censors have medical expertise?  Big Tech is showing its true agenda and beliefs.  Google and YouTube are using the tools of capitalism to promote views that is not in the framework of freedom of speech.Hubris of this kind is the beginning of neo-Marxist agenda that crushes freedom"
I LOVE IT but something you need to remove. Hi YouTube I love your app sooooooooo much In fact Im a YouTuber myself. But my question is why do you put those questions instead of ads.. i call it an invasion of privacy Why do you have to know that stuff Its our Business not yours But aside from that thank you for this app its the best thing in the world to me Byeeeeee
"Should be removed from the App Store. As a platform YouTube is pure garbage with weird censorship rules. You can watch people make money smoking themselves to death on tobacco but any video that isnt a product demo (even tobacco products) is subject to demonetization and removal for hurting peoples feelings. Words are more dangerous than reviews of cancer causing agents according to this company. Despite every video being a product advertisement there are also ad breaks in videos that can be as long as an hour. Seriously, an hour long ad in a 5 minute video makes sense to these people. Its criminal at this point because you can only upload if you are a business or influencer, which actually just means salesman without the steady employment. This site and its parent company need to be replaced, the data tracking is wild too. This app looks through everything, it records everything. Its disturbing what they collect and how I have no control over any of it when its evident from all my spam that they are selling my data to literally anyone that will pay for it. YouTube is the absolute worst platform for video sharing"
"Ummm. Ok so I know google sells your data, and seeing ads on youtube for stuff I recently looked up really isnt that big a deal for me. But I just got on youtube and Literally everything in my recommended was ads. There were like 7 rows of just ads and then it wouldnt let me scroll down anymore.  I tried going out and refreshing it and then I powered my phone off but it was the same thing"
"Ok I guess. This app is one useful streaming platform. My only problem - and this is definitely shared by other people - is COPPA. Videos getting struck as Made For Kids decreases the revenue, making it harder to earn money or even earning nothing at all. Animators like TerminalMontage (who has made a video on this) are very vulnerable to this. A COPPA RECAPThat provision of the settlement has raised questions among content creators about how to determine if what they upload to YouTube or other platforms is directed to children. The answer requires a brief summary of some key COPPA provisions. Passed by Congress in 1998, the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act is a federal law that protects the privacy of children under 13. COPPAs foundational principle is one that most people can agree on: Parents  not kids, companies, platforms, or content creators  should be in control when it comes to information collected from children online.The FTC enforces the law through the COPPA Rule. In general, COPPA requires operators of commercial websites and online services that are directed to children(more about that in a minute) to provide notice and obtain verifiable parental consent before they collect personal information from kids under 13.The COPPA Rule defines personal information to include obvious things like a childs first and last name or home address, but thats not all. Under COPPA, personal information also covers what are called persistent identifiers  behind-the-scenes code that recognizes a user over time and across different sites or online services. That could be an IP address or a cookie when its used to serve targeted ads. Keep in mind that an operator also might be collecting personal information through an open comment field on its site or service that allows a user under 13 to make personal information publicly available. For example, think of a comment like this on a child-directed site: My name is Mary Jones from Springfield. I love this videoThis is a bit of text I found. I get it, turning off comments for the protection of children, but us creators have to go through a hell of a lot more just to lift these restrictions. Summed up: Screw COPPA"
"Yeah. It was an alright app. I just got tired of being tracked and watched and listened to. I wouldnt even have to say anything and Google (YouTube) knew exactly where I was and show me ads to the store or places Id visit. And the amount of ads YouTube has. I miss when thered be no ads or even one ad. Now its like 2 ads before a video, multiple ads during and 2 more ads after the video and they need to harvest your data and invade your privacy for all these ads. Ads have become the curse of social media. And not to mention, YouTube has basically become tik tok now, sick of seeing nothing but narcissistic people starving for attention and validation. I slowly want to take my privacy and sanity back and start living life in the moments instead of glued to my phone. It started with deleting my Facebook account, IG account and now my YouTube account. Next will be my entire Google account (when I can)"
Ads. Its incredible how you guys have added soooo many ads to the point that Im done. I have uninstalled you and for the foreseeable future Ill be moving my business more towards privacy and ...... not so many ads
Love YouTube premium but hate the tracking. I pay for this why cant I not have my privacy?
Opinion of YouTube. I love YouTube for the chance of being around gamers and viewing how they do their trade but I dont like how the automation relies on bad data and inflates ads for thing people do not need or want. I especially dont like the talk about the new bill that could damage the gamers livelihood because of broken laws that have not been fixed. The last problem to address is the recommendations. Why do the recommendations always give us videos we didnt ask for? The algorithm needs better tuning than this. Lastly I dont like how the copyright tag is abused so new content makers cant have a fair chance to do what they love. If we gamers and entertainers cant use clips or games for our platform then I say YouTube is broken and dead already because of the lack of human effort. A machine cannot replace a human being for these lines of work. The job of a site moderator is to fix the system so their platform can be used and viewed not left to machine cleanup by default. Fix your stuff or you WILL be out of business
"Sad you cant rate less than a star. Temporarily or permanently banning YouTube content creators because people dont go along with what the status quo is even when factual data has been presented to prove that set content has not violated YouTubes terms and conditions is blatantly hypocritical when there is other content being spread across the platform that violates the terms and conditions and that has also been proven to be false and had to be retracted in certain news media. But there is someone who is fighting for the right of other content creators (present and future) to speak truthfully factual data that should also be allowed the right to post without the fear of being demonetized or banned. So with that being said, Im speaking to you who delegates a person getting banned or demonetized. You are and others like you are whats causing the downfall of free speech provided its the truth and also why you wont be able to hide in your safe spaces for much longer"
"Google only going Greater. Everyone likes, loves or at least uses Google. Stop foul crying about privacy issues. I am sure the Google will prevail on this issue also. No doubt Google has gone and will go only bigger, better and greater in its trajectory"
"Permissions. You dont need access to the camera and microphone to upload a video in the gallery. People have privacy concerns, and I know Google will never fix this because they want all the data, but you shouldnt be prevented from uploading a finished video just because you dont want to give it camera and microphone permissions"
YouTube ignores privacy. YouTube will allow any creep to post videos of children on their platform. They are unscrupulous indecent people just like the creeps that post
"Commercial application. If I wanted to watch a commercial every 2 minutes or less I would look up funny commercials on my own. Since hands have changed of YouTube the commercials have gotten worse and worse. I pay for data on my phone why should I pay my data costs to watch something that takes up more of my data that I do NOT care about. I dont care about 90% of the things advertised to me anyway, even with a customized preference"
"What do you expect?. The app is simple to get started, simple to use, and has become the standard for Web video and, increasingly, audio, too.But this doesnt mean Youtube sets a very high standard. The value in this app comes from the features developed years ago and the monopoly content position Google enjoys. Meanwhile, playlist functions remain buggy and categorization of childrens content is comically wrong. And data privacy remains overlooked until regulators catch up. Users dont have comparable alternatives,  so Google doesnt have obligations to set a higher standard"
No privacy. Harvest all your data use and sell
Cant watch anything without giving YouTube personal information. I cant watch content from my favourite creators anymore without submitting a picture of valid ID such as a credit card or drivers license Im sorry but what?Why should I be forced to hand a mega corporation (which are untrustworthy at best) my incredibly sensitive information just to be able to watch a video which YouTube deems harmful because it contains one incident of fOuL lanGuAgE. I mean if youre going to be dodgy as a company at least be subtle about it
"Too many ads, no disklikes, nerfed for premium. This app has way way way way way too many ads. They are repetitive and drive me crazy. There is no variety to videos so you end up in feedback tunnels and dont see other areas of life making you feel very claustrophobic. Their algorithm will make you ADDICTED to their platform.  Im not joking. It will make you properly addicted. I wish I never used YouTube in the last six years. They stunt features to force people into premium. You cant play videos outside of the app. You cant close it and multitask or use YouTube to listen to podcasts or music without your app being open and screen on. They also got rid of the dislike button. It is incredible that a company can make an addictive product (truly absolute addictive) and then have zero consequences when it comes down to how it effects users. Both mentally, financially and productivity wise. There is no regulation in this space and no over sight. The whole world has gone off the rails and it starts by cracking down on just haves. Their have to be dislikes so people can express themselves, their have to be audits on algorithms with both internal AND more importantly EXTERNAL testing from an independent government (that is crucial) owned body funded by the government. It is unexceptable and will have serious health consequences and life time consequences for future generations of change doesnt get passed. Their has to be change to the algorithms to allow for a clear net benefit of using the product or service rather than a mental drain that causes addiction. Im incredibly disappointed at the tech industry and it seems like it started by idolizing entrepreneurs who care very little about people. Its not right to let the market just run. Government needs to step in. People arent just time and attention. Their needs to be heavy heavy heavy regulations passed on advertising. Both where, what and logically why. Our society doesnt have to run on selling 24/7. Companies will have to be competitive within the realm of consumer benefit. This is unacceptable"
"Deleted. Deleted to the intrusive and abusive ads that pepper your eyeballs with stuff you dont care about. That being said I found a better way to watch YouTube videos without having to submit to YouTube (and by association, googles) addiction to your data which, if personified, they would shoot up like heroine addicts with every click"
Google steals your data. Use at your own datas riskgoogle will collect data it has no right to and will sell it
I hate the age restriction bs. Hi I personally i do not like the idea of having to give youtube my personal information. But it wont let me unless i show it. I find this invasive and annoying. You arent helping anyone
"Dreadful. 6/2020. Forced to &#39;downgrade&#39; the app yet again...More BS ads... google must be running scared since FTC fined FB over $5B for privacy issues, and has now turned attention to Google. Whoever told you to auto-preview a feed was not only wrong, but should NEVER be allowed to breed. Update: Why are the SAME videos appearing, when I KEEP indicating that I am not interested?????????????  Latest crap is continuing to shove non-English videos at users  Google/YouTube just has a pathetic corporate philosophy, that doesn&#39;t care about users.  And- for any who say that they like ads - I work 60+ hours per week:: I challenge any (ahem) youtuber to have a full-time job... before wanting to make (not earn) money from posting videos. Get a freaking life.  Try working for a living...Abject inept programmers have ruined the app.You morons don&#39;t allow users to decline live feeds or news, then you shove partisan politics down our throats?????Total BS. Update: If you are dissatisfied with the app, complain LOUDLY to the companies that place ads on this piece of crap app. Tell the advertisers that you will no longer buy their product. Update:  Ads, ads, ads... Do you think your customers give a hoot about those products?  Not a chance... in fact, shoving those ads down people&#39;s throats is a great way to encourage us to NOT buy the product... it is insulting. how many times do I have to click on &#39;Not interested&#34;?????Start scrolling and the same stupid entries keep coming back into the list. Do you idiots even TRY to read user reviews and improve your product???And, BTW, all the BS ads - I&#39;ve started contacting the various companies, and alerting them that since they advertise on YouTube, I&#39;d hesitate to do business with them. Alerting friends and family about the same advertisers, as well. The programmers at Google/YouTube seem to be in a competition with Facebook to see who can make the worst &#39;updates&#39;. Switching to landscape mode is a crapshoot. Can&#39;t scrub to FF or REW.Putting ads in THE MIDDLE of videos?  Really??There are absolutely no excuses why &#34;updates&#34; should make any app worse.  Shame on you"
Google is a small company. I know YouTube is just a mom and pop company run by tiny skeleton crew on literally no budget And for mining my data is the main objective not fixing the app its not their fault theyre such a tiny company with no money I get it I understand Im poor too
"Do Better YouTube. Why are there so many ads? Why are the dislikes gone? Why is YouTube asking me for my credit card information to confirm my age? I thought my privacy was meant to be protected. This app shouldnt be frustrating to use, its 2022 why are things moving backwards instead of forwards. Im tired of this. Do better YouTube"
Privacy problems. My email for my account was changed to a new gmail account for my girlfriend that has nothing to do with YouTube or my email
Controlling the content. All of last year before the election I saw how you were hacking the information and how hard it was to find what I was looking for ... its disgusting. I cant believe your ideology blinded you to take peoples freedom of content away
Update. I was wondering do you guys planning on adding a feature were if your account been hacked . You can transfer your data to your new email. Or a feature were u can transfer your data like all the people you subscribe to an playlist u made to your new YouTube account so u can keep everything. With out starting over . I noticed alot of hacking has been going on with YouTube lately and I feel people will appreciate it if y&#39;all add some new features that will let that  feel more secure. Like make a password or a boost of security update. Because I have been noticing that the hackers are going to people email accounts an deactivate there Google accounts and personal information by YouTube.So just wondering do you guys planning on boosting and fixing your security on YouTube so people can feel more secure I appreciate the help y&#39;all gave me on recovering my account. Y&#39;all should also add that on YouTube so people can fix things fast before deactivating there emails.I think you guysShould add the username and password feature because that wouldn&#39;t be connected to the person emailAn y&#39;all should fix the search feature because Everytime I look up a video nothing new pops up and y&#39;all have allot of sexual stuff popping upAnd every time I tap on a video that is not inappropriate it won&#39;t let me watch the video please make a update that fix the problem
"YOUTUBE Always Helps Find the Light on the Otherside. From this Era and Onwards, Youtube has been the Pioneers on the Forefront of the Internet for Media (hailing 2nd place only to A.I. Search Engines) providing everyone on the Planet Earth (and beyond) access to everything that We as a People have become.From Personal Shares, to Nature, to Film and Animated Features, Youtube is the #1 Source of all Entertainment"
YouTube is on the downhill slope. All the YouTube developers can do now is take features away... push more ad space and subscription services... the bottom line is they continue removing account control features in an attempt to undermine the ability of the user to maintain privacy on apple products and be just another google statistic ...Update 7-10-21 the recent bug fixes also messed up comment section reply&#39;s stability
YouTube. Most of my data goes to my YouTube entertainment and information gatheringThanks YouTube
"Too much information being tracked. I am constantly bombarded with political ads, specifically from a candidate who I vehemently dislike. I try to say this ad is not relevant to me like I usually I can with the ads. I did with all the stupid Lele Pons ones. So I try to do that I am unable to, Youtube says I have to change my ad settings, so I go into that setting and find YouTube has been tracking my location, age, interest, gender (without having it listed and it got it wrong), my relationship status, my pet and child status, my education level, even down to how I pay for where I live (renting vs own) and many more inappropriate information YouTube and Google are tracking far far far too much information. This needs to stop. I hate talking about something and then getting a youtube ad for the what I was just talking about"
"Honesty is the BEST POLICY. I understand that you all have Community Guidelines regarding the spread of &#34;disinformation&#34;, but it&#39;s not right to redefine &#34;disinformation&#34; as you and your agenda see fit. It&#39;s wrong to consider alternative ideas and beliefs, or most importantly, the release of knowledgeable information that contradicts the mainstream, especially when the alleged &#34;disinformation&#34; is presented to viewers by showing the documents, data, etc. that back the facts that you have single handily decided not to be facts. As I myself have never made and posted any video, I wouldn&#39;t know, but I do sincerely hope that you at least take the time to review the videos you strike down regarding sensitive information that may, or may not, by considered controversial &#34;disinformation&#34;, and you don&#39;t just judge people&#39;s work off of titles, or the first minute or two... Most (but definitely not all) &#34;conspiracy theorists&#34; are simply people who exercise the muscle taking up the space in between their ears, who have been labeled as such in order to demonize them. Demonizing free thinkers and trying to shame them for thinking for themselves, in turn subliminally gets the masses to become lazier and dumber. It also gets them to just believe/do as their told by &#34;real news&#34; in fear of also being demonized, criticized, publicly shamed, and labeled.It&#39;s sad that I can watch people eat and listen to the disgusting noises the make chewing (I think it&#39;s called yuck bang..?  Or, probably not cause that would be accurate, but it&#39;s something like that...), watch people put on makeup, or probably even how some random person ties their freakin shoes right before asking viewers to buy stuff with their name on it, but when I&#39;m curious about current or past events, am inquisitive of any data being portrayed to the public, or even want to better understand the &#34;rights&#34; we supposedly have, but no longer truly do, I can&#39;t.  You limit the information and choose how much can&#39;t be learnt about a corporation which named itself &#34;United States&#34;, and while misrepresenting themselves by fraudulently impersonating Our government, have self righteously declared authority over the Citizens, deeming the People its &#34;property&#34;, stripping us of Our sovereignty. If someone gets much deeper though... Gone God forbid anyone dare report about true disinformation regarding Covid 19, and the lies were being told about viruses, personal health and safety, and their highly (admitted) exaggerated death tolls. The true disinformation gets to stay, the truth gets bootedIt&#39;s not really possible to educate ourselves on your platform much anymore, sadly I&#39;m sure you would back the CIA... I mean mainstream media... and also slanderously deem those of us that call ourselves Truthers (as that&#39;s what we constantly seek) &#34;sovereign citizens&#34;, which is something that is not even possible to be, since by it&#39;s own definition is completely oxymoronic in nature. That makes a &#34;sovereign citizen&#34; a figment of some ignorant morons imagination. Doesn&#39;t it say something that both the terms &#34;conspiracy theorist&#34; and &#34;sovereign citizen&#34; were created by the CIA, specifically to scare Americans from questioning their supposed &#34;authority&#34;, their narrative, and therefore whatever agenda they have up their sleeve? It&#39;s all premeditated manipulation, mind control, and scary While it&#39;s too late to make a long story short... What I&#39;m trying to get at is that it would be nice to see a company &#34;make it big&#34;, but remember how it started, where it came from, who it once was, and remember &#34;us little guys&#34; that helped you get there. Now we must rely on other means, or optional platforms when seeking to expand our knowledge due to unfair and unjust censorship incorrectly in the name of &#34;disinformation&#34;. Hopefully BitChute won&#39;t feed us to the dogs.I guess there&#39;s always the yuck bang garbage... I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ll monetize that, but censor truth "
Disappointed. YouTube is ok it use to be better now they play so many ads an use up your data especially when your not connected to WiFi you cant even watch a simple video without forced ads popping up I understand theres a subscription to buy an all that but should we be obligated to purchase a subscription just to enjoy a simple video none of the ads that play are even useful if anything we the people should charge YouTube for playing ads on our data or at least have some consideration an not play a fifteen minute ad between a five minute video theres a lot more they need to work this app has gone downhill
"Garbage. Doesn&#39;t work, ads are stupid, false terminations, censorship.The only thing that works is tracking, though.Prioritizing data selling over actually working and good services?Sounds about google to me"
Ads. Too many ads running during personal people videos. Before and after are ok
Improvements. l love YouTube but there are some things I would changeAddsMake a kids account Hide personal stuffDo maches / what you think they want to watch
"Deleting. YouTube is turning into more ads than content, deleting this Google backed data syphon and switching to just using the browser with an ad block. Die in a million fires Google"
"SIGN IN SO WE COULD SPY ON YOU. Apparently u can only use youtube now if u sign in. which spy on ur every activity accross the web, nothing is free and no more privacy. They even sensor contents when its about china., people will hear and see what THEY want u to see and that power. Lets question everything we hear and see"
Intrusive of privacy. How do they manage to force me to update their app to watch a video that are paid for with ads on their site?
Why be so shady. YouTube is horribleThe privacy app report shows YouTube using my location in the background even with my location turned off thanks Google
Security Issue. I noticed youtube still has FULL ACCESS to all my photos even though I put the settings to not have it allowed to access any photos. Please explain this to me and everyone elses privacy your invading? APPLE FIX THIS
"Ads worse than cable TV. UPDATE: Even worse. As I was trying to share a YouTube video to a friend, I shared an ad instead... YouTube took advantage of the shortened links. This is a huge invasion of privacy as my personalized ads are being mistakenly shared by me. WORST. APP. EVER.-Horrific user experience of an app with ads served in every crevice of its interface. On the start of the video, top of the video description, loading a video, amongst the list of video recommendations, and many more. Definitely getting way more ads than cable TV and it is absolutely disgusting. Google has almost every single information about you from your GMail, Google Maps, and Google Drive, and they are monetizing their userbase to the teeth. What a shame of a company Google has become, which is absolute TRASH"
"Ads. Riddled with ad cancer. No, I dont want to pay for premium I and I dont want to be extorted into paying for premium by being forced to watch TWO unskippable ads before EVERY video. Google, you already make enough money off of collecting and selling my data to marketers. Dont make me pay to not watch marketing as well"
Disgusted with YouTube. So not only do they feel they can sensor you. Against the first amendment of the US constitution. But they track your phones searches and history even if you ask them not to. They also intentionally present material the user has asked not to see. They also strategically present antagonistic videos in the thread they feel will bother you based on the video you chose to watch. All in the name of creating civil unrest.. I strongly feel YouTube should be prosecuted and taken from the app store until the issue is resolved
"Frustrating monopoly with great content. Content is great with so many interesting and helpful videos. I would love to see YouTube reduce data usage. I have a limited internet connection and Netflix consistently outperforms YouTube in terms of clarity and quality while using much less data.   YouTube almost seems to want to maximize data usage. Also, ads have been ramping up since covid started so Im eagerly awaiting someone to come up with a competitive video sharing service"
"My communities (NYC) feedback on you tube. I write this feedback on behalf of my community in NYC, myself and a few million Americans:While we have relied on YouTube for a lot of our enjoyment and information in the past, we have been disappointed, up-hauled, and saddened by your censorship of information relating to our right to receive facts about the presidential election 2020. You really should leave your personal political views out of your platform, and stop censoring our right to   Fact based information. You have no right to use your platform for your political gain while compromising our American basic civil rights.These are violations of unmountable proportions. While we have been loyal and reliant on YouTube in the past, we have changed our view on your platform, and are now using other outlets for our fact based, uncensored and unbiased information.Thanks,Millions of Americans"
Google is now officially evil. Ive stuck around for years on the app but you know what f This I have watched it slowly progress and become more censorship centered their is no more diversity of thought I will not be a part of this anymore Im voting with my dollars and YouTube is out. Next up will be iPhone as soon as I can I will be selling and switching to a non tracking phone. Stop supporting companies that hate you and the country you live in
YouTube always keep educated and informed even though my data goes fast with it. Good
Stop deleting views. Im disappointed to see that YouTube is manipulating data by deleting views Totally unfair and unethical
"Monopoly and too much advertising. I hate you tube for the overwhelming ads while you are watching something, It is just annoying. why hasnt been a law sue against them? Some respond please. And if you dont want ads then pay for it? Ridiculous. And Trump complains about China Tik Tok violating our privacy and stealing our information but he does not tall about Google and other big platforms doing the same if not worse here in the USA. Google violates every American or the world privacy right"
"Annoying, invasive, overall useless. This app is garbage. Its simply a way to get users to view ads and to peddle paid subscriptions. A much better alternative is to get a good Adblock browser like Brave and go directly to YouTubes website to watch there.  Oh and it also takes a ton of your personal data to sell to advertisers...among whatever else they do with it.App aside, YouTube as a company has completely gone off the rails with censorship and demonitizing.  Its hard for actual creators to enjoy the benefits of sharing their hard work to the public square.  Instead, YouTube would rather see people create another crappy react vid of some sort. Something tame and vapid for an advertiser to safely stick their brand in"
"Freedom ain't free. I love YouTube because I&#39;m free to watch whatever I want whenever I want. All it costs is my personal profile tracked across multiple platforms, targeted ads interrupting the best videos at the worst possible times, and wading through scores of questionable recommendations"
Tracks my browser history aka google search on incognito mode. What makes you think that you have the right to track private mode from google search. I search private so I wont get spam now you secretly track me when Im supposed to be in a private search outside YouTube app. Sounds like a great lawsuit to me Please stop trying to find adds for me. Im not interested in the product that you want to sell me. And by the way privacy is something that should be made a law that you cant track me when its in private mode. Sounds to me like invasion of privacy
"Irrelevant. Lost its way. Somehow youtube lost its way. It was happily my prime source of movies, news, information, and reality entertainment using most of my cellular data. However, other APPs have replaced all those video services, so I now use Youtube only bit more than System Services. Marketing and sales now dominates youtube content - basically one long advertisement supported by abusive forced exposure and video controls. It has the feeling of the end of a pyramid scheme"
"Terrible, theyll steal all the info off of your device. Without your permission YouTube will take all of your texts, contacts, calls, history, and sell it without your knowing"
"Good, but video problems. I love YouTube, but sometimes whenI upload videos, it says that it is Private when I put Public. When I edit it and put it public, it says, Error saving video data. There needs to be an update"
YOUTUBE SAID I WAS TWO YOUNGE TO HAVE A GOOGLE ACCOUNT. NOW I LOST MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL ALL MY DATA SO PLS FIX THIS IT IS THE WORST NOW EVERYTHING IS GONE
Google wants my information. Google is demanding my information in order for me to like or comment or access my favorite list. Im not selling my life to google for any reason
"Ok. I spend most of my time on YouTube and so far its been great but theirs just a lot of things in it that are useless. For example, when changing the quality I hate how it asks if I want to use all these other things like data saver and stuff, I just wanna change it from 360p to 720p. Simple, but its brought down because of all the other useless stuff. YouTube is fine but it has so many other things that are pointless and dont serve a purpose"
"Life Changing. Youtube has literally changed my life What an incredible time we live in when information can so easily be shared with others The youtubers who so selflessly give on their time and talent to create good content are some of the most amazing human beings on earth. I use YT every day, it entertains and informs. Cant imagine how I ever survived without it"
"Privacy nutrition label. In order for me to watch some videos, Google is saying they require my contacts, email address, physical address, location, browsing history, purchase history........no thanks"
"performs well bss an anoying privacy bug. I have been a Youtube user for years, own my own channel and everything. However, today, with the latest version, I&#39;ve seen some issues with privacy when I upload videos. The upload runs just fine, with no bumps or glitches along the way. The issue comes after the video is done processing. After the processing goes away, the video shows up as a private video, meaning that no one but me can view it. This is especially anoying because I make videos for the soul purpose of sharing them with everyone, both friends and subscribers. Can you please fix this Google? Other than this issue, performance is great. I have not had any issues with the app crashing, or videos buffering like crazy.  Thank you to Google for making Youtube so accessible to the blind community as well"
"Worst platform. I opened a channel on YouTube one year ago and because of the illegal report they suspended my ip number and my channel and they spying me for one year and they send me so many hackers emails and they wanted to hack my bank account but they didnt know Im a bank employee and no one can hack my account. YouTube support employees are dangerous and theyre hackers. I can proof it by all evidence I saved it. They abuse people, torture people because of nothing. Nasty platform ever. Dont trust google and YouTube"
invasion of privacy. ive never had a google product installed on this ipad. somehow when i downloaded youtube i was already signed in
Very poor. 1. Annoying trial buttons2. Huge volume of ads3. Privacy concerns4. Free speech concerns5. Tremendous volume of misinformation6. Ridiculous copyright restrictions7. Vast majority of content is useless and wastes time 8. Algorithms optimised at marketing/money making by exploiting human confirmation bias9. Creates personal tribal bubble10. It is not free - It exists to sell to you and gather information about you and your kids. Please consider if your safety and privacy are wort it
"Everything wrong with youtube(in my personal experience). I hate how YouTube just deletes views like the people dont work hard to get them like what, I was watching kill this love and we were at almost 50m views(48m) and YouTube took it to 45m, just why ???And how they steal views from BTS as well is outraging like we work hard to get them a lot of views but then YouTube just decides to take them away. There are times were I think YouTube stops working like I was watching a video and I think I was the first viewer and then I come back 5 minutes later and it says that no one view the video yet but that 20k people like it and that there are 10k comments like I need explanations YouTube if you cant handle someones game dont just delete their views, freeze them and/or take their likes away cause it just makes no sense. Sorry for my bad English its not my first language and Im too angry to care about grammar and spelling mistakes"
Not recommended if you value your independence & privacy. 3rd party developer w this special privileged access is selling your data no matter permission and accessing your image when ur on your phone recording everything u do and sharing it. I cannot delete this. They use custom browser and install disguised custom apps &amp; exploit you using coifed permission and certificates to use same ones as they did when contracting w law enforcement selling their technology. They can do whatever they want and they do. Same access as Top 10Most Wanted criminals tracking for ordinary ppl . They live adjacent to me.  NOT RECOMMENDED
"The website that keeps on evolving. This site used to be a true and wild place, but after a few reasonable tweaks, many unreasonable tweaks, and then even more unsettling policy changes we find ourselves at this current iteration.  This site throttles creators, bans them, shadow bans them, tracks users lives, sells their data, manipulates their feeds, alters their subscriptions, and sends representatives to lie for them in hearings. Forced ads, unstoppable ads, pop up ads, a subscription option that costs money but does not remove their manipulations.To be fair YouTube also does well in stomping out their competition by lying, yanking server providers and having other branches of Alphabet Corp push them in front. Also, ads have different volumes than videos, deleted videos on your playlist are impossible to replace because you have no way of seeing what it was named, and the search function is an absolute train wreck joke of forced results"
WHY YOUTUBE IS THE BEST. You can buy premium to remove ads Make as many subscriptions as you want See notifications and watch your favorite videos You can log in to comment like and subscribe Get YouTube to watch better
Attention. Need privacy protection
"No privacy. Wheres the privacy details, Google? Wed like to look at them"
Sell your personal info. Hey app developer you wanna explain why yall sell my info and charge me for $12.99 a month?? Take a page out of HBOs play book and give us the option to not let you sell our personal infoUpdate 5/20/20 they have increased their advertisements to YouTube red subscribers. Every time they I update it gets worse. They promote pages I dont subscribe to in my subscription section.7/24/20   Cant turn off the bs preview feature.  YouTube has developed a handy way to add views to their counter without any one clicking or even wanting to watch it
"Run away while you still can. If youre not already integrated into the google  ecosystem, dont engage. Its a nightmare. This YouTube app, in particular, has never worked properly despite being from one of the most iconic and wealthy companies in the history of the world. Not to mention theyre foundational to technology itself. Id recommend not engaging with YouTube at all, but despite the companys flaws, there is more content than you could ever see in a thousand lifetimes; literally, and theres enough quality content for exactly the time you have. Use a browser or other means if you can, to avoid the apps constant, nonsensical bugs, and do not create a playlist you dont want the world to see, as regardless of your privacy settings,the app will not comply, and your videos will be available for all the world to see.Please support Vimeo, BitChute, and other alternative video hosting platforms as much as possible. We need strong competition to drive innovation, and compel corrupt corporations like google to do the right thing.And in case it was obvious, not only are Google and YouTube horrible companies, this product is an embarrassment. Update for 2020. Its gotten worse. It crashes constantly, doesnt abide by the settings and preferences you set, and WILL violate your privacy. This app is Google/YouTube in a nutshell. Good looking on the outside, but rotten to the core on the inside. Avoid this app at all costs"
Ads. Ive used YouTube for years. I subscribed to the premium package for awhile but cant afford it any longer. Your ad content is over sold. Its not even enjoyable any longer to use YouTube. I dont even mind paying an affordable price but you are greedy and gigging us at a time when we need YouTube access the most
"Not happy. They will not let my subscribe to my favorite YouTube channels on my new tablet without my giving them my personal information so they can share it with whoever they want, I will not be manipulated by big a company so they can make money off me. My signing into my google account will give them just that. Its my information and I dont have to share it. And they know if one complains about something than 1000 also have a complaint about it. So dont ask for it and let me enjoy what I like, I dont want a bunch of people harassing me"
Deceptive. Google and Yt do weird psychological experiments on their users and sell people&#39;s information
"Excessive Ads. Even though this is the free version, the ads are sometimes overwhelmingly annoying and excessive to say the least. I would upgrade however I am shamingly broke. Anyways, I love YouTube with its content and commendable efforts to provide users with safe and reliable security and the safety of our personal information. Have a great day. Jason"
"Youtube:  Shameful Advertising Disgrace. I would give zero stars if I could (Forced Advertising) Been member 19plus years and now it wants my credit card details for age verification ?? Definitely wouldnt recommend YouTube now to anyone  Was fine before the changes. Feels like a shameful money grab, kinda like extortion for content. Sure, as a company you guys do well, ridiculously even but so why does it feel like the policy is harvesting peoples personal data and pennies? cool.. having to injure pointless unasked for content killing, soul destroying ads is the first boycott for me. 5, FIVE adverts in one 3 minute video .? Ive long made it a point to not use or buy from any business trying to selling me random crap. Boycott ..up next YouTube  Very nearly didnt waste my time writing but going by the few that have critically commented many others feel the same"

Improve. I think YouTube can be better if you can download the videos so you can watch it wherever you dont have Wi-Fi yeah whenever you want using your data
in all truth and bug fixing great job. youtube great job on the updates and privacy policy for the protection of childern online keep the success
"STOP TELLING ME TO SUBSCRIBE, GOOGLE. (UPDATED 1/25/2020. I don&#39;t want to try YouTube Premium or Red or whatever. I&#39;m going to skip the ads as quickly as I can, and wish I was on my computer with the good content blockers the entire time.I will never knowingly give Google money, they&#39;ve made far too much from selling my data already"
"Privacy problems by sharing personal videos to other channels home page. Im noticing similar videos that I watched are appearing on another family members YouTube account. On their home page some videos are channels I have either subscribed to or liked the videos. I feel as if my personal privacy of watching and liking videos of my own personal interest is being exposed to others in my family. Please, fix this annoying problem"
"YouTube is the place to learn. The only thing I do not like the fact they want sign-ups via email and monthly fees if regular user.  They want everything to be connected so they can sell your personal data.  TV, email, soon to come in fingerprinting, retinal scan and body chip to sign in; jk  Should be independent.  Its bad enough being hacked and not able to get into gmail"
Sensors way too many videos that are not in any way inappropriate. I had to watch some video for Boy Scouts that came directly from their web pageant two worked and two were restricted. They all had content about privacy on the internet and I dont understand what would be wrong with that.Thank you for reading
Censoring. Stop censoring YouTube videos like the one posted by the two physicians from Bakersfield.  They reported scientific proven data
Frack Google. Google has a MONOPOLY so why the frack who they care about their product?Horrible suggestions No customer service even though I PAY for premiumEtcThey have no competition so whats the reason for them to make a better product? Theyre all about the profit and stealing our personal dataBreak em up Break em up
Look at their privacy policy. Ads &amp; tracking Bad Google
Ad improvements and Privacy  UI concerns. Ad improvements Give user way to mark ad as1. Not of interest2. In appropriate to content being viewed 3. Length of ad disproportionate to length of video  infomercial should not be placed as an adNothing more annoying than a 60 minute infomercial placed front and back need of a creators 4 minute content. Especially for quackery. UI concerns. Creator buttonI am not one. Not planning on being one. Do not plan or see YouTube as a social media platform. Creator button function should be additive and disable ableAs is fails to protect all users Btw I do not want to share camera or mic with you. Is a security risk IMOFinal thought PIP support minimal requirement this class of device
Manipulation of data. YouTube constantly manipulates searches to spread liberal viewpoints. They are the Dems puppets
Make your privacy policies better. I am not giving you all that data that belongs to me
"filtering criticism. YouTube devs, liberal media radicalizing my feed lying, instigating, &amp; screwing with my life. Using names from my contacts, names from school yearbooks, emails,       personal data &amp; just trolling with it.  Demonstrating Quantum Supremacy from the official google channel. POLITICS bbc 12 rules of life news channels on top of countless Crude childish videos &amp; it wont stop.  Dads rule at embarrassing their daughters nerds behind YouTube screwing with people I know IRL"
Advertising is ruining you tube. I get targeted with garbage commercials that are completely irrelevant to me and cant skip. I pay to stream content and have to pay for every stupid commercial with my data almost thinking at this point of not watching anymore you tube just because of all the commercials And now stupid 30-40 second clips and 10 minute clips only Too many stupid rules
"Irrelevant. Somehow youtube lost its way. It was happily my prime source of movies, news, information, and reality entertainment using most of my cellular data. However, it now uses a only bit more data than system services. Marketing and sales dominates youtube content - basically one long advertisement supported by abusive forced exposure and video controls. It has the feeling of the end of a pyramid scheme.  Happy happy happy to leave"
"THEY MADE IT OBNOXIOUS TO CHANGE THE QUALITY. Remember when you just had to pick the quality option and then select what you wanted, because Youtubes auto for quality selection never switched from 480p if you were watching over data to 1080p when you finally got on wifi, you had to MANUALLY do that because the auto failed to be auto.Fast forward to now, all of sudden you now have to click 2 different menus PER VIDEO to switch the quality to 1080p. There is no preference, there is no-set what you want for data perefences-and-set what you want for wifi preferences. JUST VIDEO TO VIDEO PREFERENCES. So that video you want to watch one time? Like 99% of videos in the website? Yeah youre gonna have to set the quality, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. All because Youtubes data servers cant handle it when everyone has the videos running at 1080p. So what do they do? They make it so all the videos run at lower resolutions to save data, all good except YOU CANT SEE ANYTHING AT THIS GARBAGE RESOLUTION, PLEASE UNDO THIS DUMB DUMB DUMB VIDEO QUALITY UPDATE YOU DEVELOPERS PUT IN THE UPDATE A WEEK AGO"
"YouTube has become super Boring. YouTube used to provide me with new and wonderful news and information about what people worldwide are up to, now YouTube is all about tracking my personal algorithms- I dont want that I want to know what Other people are up to and what is trending for other people- I want to get out of my limited brain and learn about what interests others"
"Ads are annoying. I understand the need for ads, but if you can afford to go ad free your experience will be better. I like being able to download and be able to listen when Im not connected....much better than running out of data. Thanks to all those who upload how-to videos. Such a wealth of knowledge available"
Ads. It drives me crazy that I have to use my data plan to watch advertising. Put the ads at the end of the video so I can turn it off . I hate advertising. Hate it . And Im forced to pay for it . Stop it now
The YouTube restrictions keeps turning on. For a while now YouTube restricted keeps turning on on my phone and claiming that is a network administrator but I am using cellular data and its a personal email so I am at a loss right now
"Uploading privacy. I love the app and its great I make videos on YouTube but today I was about to upload a video and I made it public but when it finished processing and stuff, the video was private. I tried to edit it and make it public but instead it said error saving video data. I am kinda mad. Please fix this"
"Youtube needs to fix a lot. Systems that hurt creators, they screw up with collecting child data and then blame creators and put them in impossible positions, double standards everywhere, be careful with what you do here"
"BEING DISLIKES BACK YOU COWARDS. I love YouTube to death, I really do, I even use the goddamn premium. But YouTube, WHAT ARE YOU DOING REMOVING DISLIKES? Removing the ability to see dislikes? Youre kidding. SURELY YOU JEST??? This is an incredibly transparent attempt to pander to corporation and business. Do you think your consumers havent noticed your gradual policy change to emphasise promoting large news networks and late night talk shows over actual individual creators on the recommended page? Literally everyone understands that removing the dislikes heavily benefits big brands, since they can now discuss more controversial topics / products without fear of any large-scale public backlash. Its such disgustingly glaring pandering it almost physically hurts The hypocrisy is incredible given that YouTube as a platform was literally built on the back of individual creators. And now youre uselessly succumbing to corporate interests? I hate this change. I seriously hate it. Ive used and adored YouTube literally since I was a little kid using my dads barely functional old iMac. Im 18 now. I know dislikes are still there, theyre just invisible to the public but we all know what the next step will inevitably be. Dont remove dislikes. Please YouTube dont forsake the very thing you once were the brilliant and vibrant alternative to. Ive hated seeing one of the best websites on the Internet slowly decay over the years. At least the brilliant and endless content creators from every niche imaginable still remain. The people and the creators are and will continue to be the saving grace of this brilliant yet misguided site (Side note: I know ultimately this comment is pointless. YouTube removed dislikes because of money and corporate interests and theyll likely stay gone forever. But I at least want them to know that what theyre doing will be deeply hated by everyone with a conscience for years to come. Also if you read this far youre a neek. K bye)"
"Sad but true . YouTube used to be a great platform. Then corporate mentality did their usual takeover and in a very short time, managed to render YouTube toxic.The amount of advertising and censorship is greatly disappointing. The true frontier aspects of this are long gone now and we basically are back to television with regard to ads and tracking.I do hope another platform comes along offering the privacy and open territory that YouTube once represented.Thanks"
"Poor updates. Buggy. Also, I feel google is not honest about the amount and type of data they collect through this apps permission requirements"
"Hell youtube. YouTube updates are terrible. Navigating around is hell as you cant get to anything without seeing ads. Ads are not essential. Even upgrading to premium version is not worth your well earned money. Doesnt have picture in picture for iOS. The app itself consumes my battery from 100% to 23% in 30 minutes from ads. The background refresh worsens the battery. Cant watch videos anonymously anymore without signing in. The app is like Facebook in every way but with videos instead of pictures. No privacy as I found out when I had the cellular data off for a while, I turned it back on and all the ads popped up with all stuff that I was talking about. Heck Im gonna make an alternative app that supports iOS on mobile only for privacy concerns. Google tracks what you type even in incognito mode"
Fin. To many ads from crap I dont want thanks to google Im on limit data why all the dam ads
Far less user friendly. They have made the control buttons relative to the screen size to discourage interrupting displaying of adverts they are far too small and hugely increased the number of adverts.  This is rapidly losing its appeal such a shame when something so previously charming switches to being so utterly greedy.  It seems bent on trying to steal larger amounts of your data in continual survey requests and your money with continual subscription requests.  YouTube ihas becoming naff
"changes. since google took over the videos are much more censored and google is pushing their phone service and Chromebook to much, spies on us enough as it is"
Data. YouTube uses to much data
"The ads make me NOT want to buy. Stop with the ads You are wasting my phone plan data and whatever youre advertising while I using YouTube for educational purposes or to relax, I will not buy except for maybe Ulta, but only because I already have an account with them"
"Safety. Always is Hacked, and they are using it to access my privacy"
Delete it every once in a while. Works ok as they harvest every scrap of data possible. Doesnt really allow you to stop receiving videos once you enter your request. The Famed YouTube Algorithm is a joke. Thank God users add the content ... they are the ones deserving of 5-Stars
"All the demonetization. I like YouTube and I think it has great content, but too often have I seen people creating quality videos getting demonetized for original work, this problem is rampant and while I am fine with algorithms collecting our search data and such, I am not ok when you let companies, who are there to make a profit, be judge, jury, and executioner. YouTube, I know it is unlikely you will read this, but please, reconsider letting companies make the final decision and make sure a YouTube employee reviews demonetization claims, and not companies"
"Eh. I dont like that I try to preserve my data and play videos in low quality but then youtube takes it upon itself to play ads in HD. Also the first advertisement, Liza on Demand is pure utter trash, it has no goals objectives or storyline"
"Good App. While the app defaults to a strong left political bias, I havent noticed the same degree of outright political censorship as I have with Google. Once the app learns user preferences, information that isnt far left is available. Why thats enough to earn five stars in the USA in 2020? I dunno, its just where were at apparently. I sincerely appreciate the free flow of information, enough that I dont mind tracking my info. Good job YouTube ++"
"Suggestions. YouTube is an amazing platform, and is really user friendly. It gets most things right, except for streams and notifications. I think that the algorithm can be improved by prioritizing streams in the notifications. I also think that they need to fix the algorithm not pushing notifications. They also need a Spam mode which filters put streams and videos reported as Spam. This mode can be toggle-able so you can choose if you want to see the spam or not. I also think you should be able to customize your home page, putting certain YouTube Channels at higher priorities, and thus higher up the home page. I also think that YouTube should manage the algorithm instead of letting it run free. I also think that YouTube should have a video-change confirmation option. I cannot tell you the amount of times that I have accidentally clicked onto another video, so an option that makes you click twice on the video would be amazing. Other than those issues, it is one of the best apps. If I could rate it out of 100 it would be a solid 90. I would say it is one of the best mobile apps"
YouTube tracks and shares your info. There are many great creators on YouTube. However YouTube has gone beyond providing a service and is now more like a grimey middle man whos tracking and steering you towards what they want you to see while shoving adds in your face. I know they gotta make money but they are farming and grooming customers now. And censoring  political opponents
Enough is enough. Stop the censorship and unethical use of users private data
Bandwidth hog. YouTube keeps increasing the resolution to use up more of my mobile data. There needs to be a way to lock in low bandwidth especially when listening while driving instead of watching the videos
"Ads annoy people. Imagine watching a video on YouTube then the ad Interrupted then YOU GET ANGRY THOSE STUPID ADS KEEP APPEARING ITS SO ANNOYING PEOPLE KEEP GETTING ANGRY   Tell me, What are the annoying things you hate about YouTube 1. Loading VERY long2. Coppa3. ads Well another thing is internet connection So youre In a video and In a middle of a video A title appeared Youre Offline Then You said I didnt Lost my internet its still there YouTube r u Stupid?

"Delete and reinstall this app once every month. YouTube allows you to request you stop receiving videos from particular channels, but theyre too incompetent to use the data. They supposedly record your watched &amp; liked videos, but cant stop recommending them to me over &amp; over again. YouTube, if you spent less time data mining, youd probably have time to make the user experience better. Youre running things like a bunch of goofballs. Users who add the viewable content ... are the  deserving of 5-Stars, not the host"
"YouTube has stopped working for me. YouTube has stopped working for me. And it appears to be demanding that I pay for an upgrade. Its also a huge #privacy violator. From Google, the hugest of privacy violators. Deleted. Try BitChute"
"YouTube Caters to People With Subscribers. You allow people who have purchased a bunch of subscribers Bully smaller channels. You have allowed Tasha K to bully other channels but do nothing about her and her content You even gave her other peoples personal info so that she can bully them outside of YouTube. You also allow trump to spread outright blatant lies across the tops of our screens. So no, I dont like you right now and as soon and the channels I enjoy find other avenues Im right with them"
"Commercials. Its not right that we have to buy these expensive phones and we pay for the data to use these phones and then we have to watch commercials.. Or pay for ad free. Another rip off. Because its not free from the start. Its using my data to have to put up with commercials. I understand free television using commercials. But its wrong to use my data on ads and commercials. And that is what slows down my connection.. And the ads are annoying when they keep trying to distract you. Technology is stupid. They survived years without this crap. All it has done it cost money and then we have to worry about getting hacked. We have paid to have the government buildings built and we paid for all of the technology to be installed . We pay for the internet access and all of the equipment in those buildings, court houses, police departments. And if we want a document from the public records we have to pay for that also. And we have to pay to file a lawsuit. When the judges get paid from our taxes. And now they put a fence around the capital building that we the people own. Plus we pay for everything in that building. And we have to open the border so more people can take from us. The system is a scam"
"The bots. Your use of bots and algorithms, machinery that only take data and match it up word-for-word, has ruined the potential of YouTube as a platform for new beginnings and the fact that you refuse to do anything about it speaks volumes of which side you actually care for"
Pushing white supremacy propaganda. No matter how many times I use stop seeing this ad or any other Google settings I continue to be bombarded with white supremacy propaganda ads.  Its bad enough these bad actors are given a platform but being hounded by these ads is unacceptable. You collect data yet cant seem to utilize that data
Sell your personal info. Hey app developer you wanna explain why yall sell my info and charge me for $12.99 a month?? Take a page out of HBOs play book and give us the option to not let you sell our personal infoUpdate 5/20/20 they have increased their advertisements to YouTube red subscribers. Every time they I update it gets worse. They promote pages I dont subscribe to in my subscription section
"YOUTUBE NOW MAKES YOU SHOW ID OR A BANK CARD TO VERIFY YOUR AGE OF THE ACCOUNT. I tried to watch a breast reduction video because im thinking of getting surgery when I save up some money and Youtube had the audacity to ask for my a picture of my passport, drivers license, ID or Bank Card. I think its ridiculous and stupid. Youtube Kids was made for a reason. All these restrictions and demonstrations for someone saying the word hell are seriously getting out of hand. The constant two adds every time you click on a video and the unskippable adds make me want to rip out my hair. I think Youtube are full of c**ts and deserve to go bankrupt at trying to get my personal info I cant even watch restricted videos in peace or theyll ask me for my banking details now What kind of clownery is this? I miss the times youtube had none to minimal adds and less restrictions. People are so prude and annoying these days"
"YouTube. 1st point: why do you keep asking whether or not I find the ads relevant? Why do you think I should be giving free info to you so you can increase you targeting conversion rate and sell more pricey ads placement? Do you really think I want marketers to target me better so they can sell me stuff I dont need? I find that pretty annoying tbh 2nd point: If I wanted  to try YouTube premium for free for a month, maybe I would have done it the first or second time the offer popped upNo need to keep asking after a few months of it existing, that too is annoying 3rd point: too many adds 4th point: I should get a reward for this info 5th point: too many ads"
Censorship. I think its sad that you continue to invade our privacy
Ridiculous. Not happy with seeing what data YouTube collects from me with the new update from iOS 14.A complete invasion of privacy 
"Privacy Concerns, Background Location Tracking?. Im a stickler for privacy and apps/services using my location when expressly not given. I have all location tracking turned off for most iOS apps and paused Web and App Activity and Location History for my Google Account. However, Google continuously is able to see my iPhone device location, even when Im not currently using any Google Services on my phone and have background updates turned off. The only conclusion I can come up with is Google is using YouTube to track my location? "
YouTube please respond. Algorithm is addictive and doesnt help the 99% get out of the bottom. The amount of information that is withheld from your data base is unimaginable.. why arent we being pushed into a better direction? You are able to control that but choose to keep us in the dark
"The Good & The Bad YouTube App. This YouTube App is very sophisticated and stable. It rarely crashes My concerns related to the YouTube App are based on privacy. This YouTube App has the ability to scan what you write on posts. It has the ability to censor the user. No free speech. The algorithms used for searches are broadcasting and finding sexual related videos that I didnt ask for, as far as sexual related content"
Worst autocratic minded people are running this app. Respect people privacy
Opinion of YouTube. I love YouTube for the chance of being around gamers and viewing how they do their trade but I dont like how the automation relies on bad data and inflates ads for thing people do not need or want. I especially dont like the talk about the new bill that could damage the gamers livelihood because of broken laws that have not been fixed. The last problem to address is the recommendations. Why do the recommendations always give us videos we didnt ask for? The algorithm needs better tuning than this
evil company. will harvest and exploit your data and censor content that is in your best interest to see
"Horrible coppa rules. Ok so Im trying to keep this short, why would you add that kids privacy  thing is theres YouTube kids?? I mean I try saving a video on medical help on what I have but I cant, so why would you make this a thing? So many people that I know no longer use this platform to show off what they do because theyre scared of being sued.. therefore no longer to do their dreams. Its so horrible now"
To many ads. They need to calm down on the ads. I get one every 2-5 min of watching content. If it keeps up Im going to delete and go to something else. Im not paying just so you can still force ads on to me. We should all send them a bill for all the data they are wasting
Ad crazy. YouTube is very smart about ads. They should track what ads you just saw. It makes watching YouTube a pain if you watch ten videos and the all have basically the same ads. Also they dont seem targeted well either. A lot of times they are all ads for things I would never have an interest in purchasing. It makes me click through ads instead of watching them. And some videos have so many ads imbedded in they they are not worth watching even if I know I like the content
"The Gmail. I was informed that I changed my profile in August 2021    I never did and I answered you back. It has been 5 months since I have not been able to use Gmail, (used to be my favorite) at all.  I have tried to enter back multiple times, but it seems stupid questions have been formatted by your staff. General questions are answered by Google very well.  When compared with Safari, the latter is better. Since I left Gmail, my spam and scam calls became overwhelming.  I had to buy Spam Blockers   It has been noted by those who can overlook Google and Gmail activity that you do sell private data even if you have it in the agreement that you dont.  For personal profit by your staff ?  You are the WORLDS BIGGEST CORPORATION   Are people hiding under your umbrella ?"
I only watch YouTube video for all my information. Who needs TV not me I have YouTube
"YouTube is the Blockbuster of Social Media. Get your defense team and checkbook ready, Ms. Wojcicki.  YouTube is past due for seizure, bankruptcy and extinction. The entire corporation is corrupt due to your practice of censorship and suppression. Many content providers have been data mined, banned and/or demonetized. What a glorious day it will be when you, Susan, finally meet Karma"
YouTube thinks were all dumb kids. Were not stupid we dont need a data saver mode alternative to the quality settings weve had for years why make it Advanced settings just leave it the way it was and get rid of these options
"One of the worst apps in the App Store. This is one of the absolute app and service there is. They should he honest and just call it an advertisement app. Not only is Google spying on everyone and sell our information for some mega bucks, but they play stupid ad after ad after ad. YouTube now has more ads than an advertisement agency.  When an ad comes ip mid roll I just stop watching.And to top it off, to subscribe is more expensive than Netflix, HBO, or pretty much any movie/streaming service. Greed at its best Perhaps they should have different prices for different services. I own over 5,400 songs. I buy my music, not rent it. Run out of money and kiss your music bye bye. Therefore  I dont care for anyones music service. Why should I pay for something I dont need or use? Oh that is right, I remember now, Googles crazy greed"
I really like YouTube. The idea of YouTube is to be free and share private and personal video that citizen of the world creates but more and more we are losing that idea we are now looking at a big commercial structure production made by the top business of the world.  Just a taught
"Bad management. Control user privacy without permission.The endowment against human rights.Supporting injustice, occupation and tyranny"
Please fix this bug. Everyone I know that posts on YouTube cant change their privacy settings to public viewing when they post a video please fix the bug
Too many ads. Its exaggerated to add ads for every watched minute. Its enough that google steals our data
Suppression of speech. Looking for better video platforms that allow freedom and will not sensor thought. I dont want to see inappropriate sexual content want controls to sensor filth out. In the past I could access my video history. I already downloaded the app. I dont feel I should have to log in to access this. I dont like logging in and giving even more permission to track me
"Who can afford streaming video?. The YouTube app seriously needs the ability to download videos to watch later. I can not afford to watch streaming video on my cell phone data plan. It's so easy to exceed my data limits just with Google maps and a few websites which I visit which automatically seem to launch videos without my explicit permission. A lot of apps having running ads that change all the time that must really eat into my data budget. I've only used the cell phone app a few times. I visit the desktop site once a week. But if I could download videos for off-line viewing, YouTube would become my go-to site for entertainment when I'm bored standing in line at the grocery store"
Next update. The next update should be a privacy setting. My parents are always leaning over my shoulder to see what Im doing and its annoying. They also watch what Im watching when Im asleep. So I want like a passcode they have to put in so they cant log into my YouTube account and invade my privacy. So I think we need a privacy setting
Forced to pay data fees to download commercial data. Pisses me off that I have to pay for my data only to be forced to download and watch useless commercials and ads on my dime and time
Your ads are extortion. Love how you get to invade my visual privacy by forcing foul ads down my throat in an attempt to extort money from me and millions of others by making us pay you money for content you dont create if we want to be spared the atrocious assault of the advertising
"You Tube is spying on you and  You Tube is blocking comments. You Tube and Google are spying on us. You Tube,Google, Face Book and Twitter gets away from crimes b/c they are Billionaires"
"Suggestion algorithm is garbage. YouTube was created as way for people to share information ideas and culture. Over the last few years they have turned it into something else. The suggestions they feed you are loosely based on your personal preferences or interests, and entirely over feeding you channels that are high traffic thus helping YouTube generate more revenue. I understand as a business the goal is to make money. But theyre making enough money and exploiting everyone who uses this app/website to fill pockets. Also the level of tracking they use on their users is totally creepy"
"Great app but some bug fixes to do. YouTube is so creative to use but there was some bugs that I found recently, whenever I upload a random video and when its finished, it automatically set it private even though I didnt even set it to private and when tried to set it back to public it received a data error please fix the bug"
"Over-Run with ads. Ive been a user since the very beginning... Ive seen ads, and now ALL I SEE IS ADS, in the middle of a five minute video there will be three ads... its too much. Its worse than watching television. The contents is still fantastic but the ads are so much of a distraction. When the app is FREE: its either trying to sell you something all the time, taking your info and selling it, or inundating you with ads In this case YouTube does all three"
Coppa. I loved YouTube and still kinda do but the new coppa rule is just...stupid. I get that YouTube is trying to protect kids privacy or whatever but the extra rules and stuff are just garbage. I dont know if YouTube is gonna be the same later but right now it is just dumb. I hope you guys see this and I hope you guys will do something to change it because soon my favorite youtubers will maybe quit
Too many annoying 15 second ads. Too many ads especially when streaming with data. How dare they waste my data like that
"Valuable. YouTube is a platform that provides a path to mentorship, personal advancement, unlimited education (fitting for all literally Everyone), entertainment, and information. In a single location I find, encouragement, relatability, and appreciation of life itself "
"This app is a metaphor for dystopia. So there are biased political ads you cant block, certain YouTubes who are loved by many are banned for no reason, vids on games rated 13+ are restricted to 18+ accounts, awful updates, glitchy code, no respect for the discretion of privacy, stupid restrictions, too many ads followed by hey BUY OUR $#T, awful loading, and pointless updates such as oh we changed where the comments are even though no one cared.  This is disgusting for a website commandeered by a mega-beast company like google. Id like to show up to Susan (last name NO ONE CAN REMEMBER)s house with a whopping lawsuit on literal legal conditions they failed to follow. Any review thats positive for YT is old, and like a politician (no, I wont say what I think, the review area is for facts only) once said, MAKE YOUTUBE GREAT AGAIN. Theres just so much wrong the only reason I use it is because its the only place where I can get the videos Im looking for"
My Data and Censorship by a Mega Corp. Any and all censoring is a cancer. But yet this is what the rich j3ws who run the site want. Rest In Peace Joan Rivers
"Stop trying to get my phone number. All I want to do is use my channel to save videos and other channels like Im bookmarking websites. Now Google are refusing go to let me sign in unless I give up my phone number. I tried using a website that generates a number and used an old email address to get a verification code but both times YouTube said it couldnt verify these were the account holder but they now have an new email address for their data mining, grrrr Also lots of videos are age restricted and need more of our data as proof of who we are. It also looks like Google are using YouTube to data mine our mobile devices too. This is beyond outrageous and just shows how underhand Google are. It wouldnt matter so much except YouTube is the number one video streaming site and the only place to access a lot of particular videos"
Hiding dislikes for corporate sponsors. Hiding dislikes to the benefit of the multinational corporate sponsors and their consumeristic propaganda through ADs they care about money and nothing more I use to enjoy the platform but I cant anymore they care about catering to companies and their wallets not to small content creators I hope they listen but I doubt they care as long as that money flows.. we have sold ourselves to the machine so algorithms can tell us what We should buy they target us using our info for psychological profiling. Be Free

"My use of YouTube. YouTube has evolved to become a source of data and research in support of my job as a technology advisor, a source of interviews and lectures to inform my personal pursuits of knowledge and a source of entertainment and news. You should send me an occasional survey with suggested subject areas and topics of interest to refine the content that is presented when i login or better yet when i click a widget called My Interests. Thank you for the great product and service you provide"
"YouTube keeps banning my favorite content. A lot of the people I subscribe to on YouTube have been removed from the platform. Theres little reason for me to stay. I canceled my YouTube premium and have moved to Apples podcast app, where I can access all of these people again - and for free without ads. Plus, I noticed a lot if glitches with YouTube on the iPhone, especially when moving from wifi to cellular data. The app would freeze and Id have to close it, reopen it, and go back to the video I was listening to. Apples app handles this seamlessly"
Lot of videos advertisements. Its annoying with lot of video advertisements and wasted your mobile data time to change Netflix or Disney +
"Clunky app - trust issues. Really dont like google as a company, fine them to be a slightly better Facebook in the way they track and sell the data of everything you do. Obviously I cant just leave the platform but it probably wont be too long till it kills itself anyway. The app is fine for most use cases but it doesnt follow iOS13 system theme, it sometimes has loading issues making me have to restart the app, the content suggestion system is quite frankly sh*t, and the new storys and community posts litter the home screen. YouTube does not put the content first, both literally and metaphorically as most pages header has an ad (home, recommended, search, etc). Content is sometimes ok but thats not down to youtube anyway"
"Just, why?. Is the YouTube team (developers.) so utterly useless and have basically nothing to do, but ruin the platform further? First you have them demonetising good, hard working creators (for swearing.), second, they disable the dislikes so you didn\'t know if a video was to be dodgy or not (if comments were turned off as well.), third, they advertise, or shall I say force, LGBT crap in your face (through their own terrible adverts.) and finally, the resolution, you can\'t manually adjust the resolution (quality) of the video anymore, you either have; \Auto\, \Data Saver\ or, \Higher Picture Quality.\ Which in my experience (With 5G) puts you on 340p with no manual way to adjust it, like I said. I used to be able to stick it up to 1080p with no issue, no stutters or anything. The platform was near perfect before YouTube started buffering their own creators up, with no freedom of speech. This time 2-3 years ago, it would\'ve been an easy 5/5, but now, no"
"Very Telling. That YouTube hasnt updated their Apps to inform users of the information theyre stealing from them, to track and sell for profit. Dont Be Evil"
ADs are a bit ridiculous. If I wanted this many ads Id pay for cable TV. Either way forcing users to pay an insane price for ad-freedom and feature like PIP - while youre already mining our data to sell marks Google as a problem of modern technology
"Stop Taking Away Features to Promote Your Subscription. Restricting built-in capabilities on iPhone apps (namely picture-in-picture mode in iOS 14) is literally against Apples App Store Guidelines 3.2.2. Promote your subscription service by offering NEW AND EXCLUSIVE content &amp; features, not by taking away features that already exist on EVERY OTHER APP. What a slimy, anti-consumer way to sell your failing subscription service. It makes absolutely no sense to restrict a mobile devices capabilities when those same features are free to use on desktop versions of YouTube. Google just keeps making mistake after mistake when attempting to monetize this platform. Offer ad-free viewing and offline-saving as the primary selling points, and allow users to run videos in the background as is expected"
Doesnt encourage free thinking. They arbitrarily change the rules based on how right or wrong they feel your content is :/ they are marking all the users &amp; selling the users Data
Privacy invasion. This You tube channel is invasion privacy of others and its in appropriate for public
". YouTube app is OKAY but the ADS are VERY ANNOYING. Why? Its because the ads DOES NOT NEED to TAKE THE WHOLE SPACE when youre a watching a video. EVERY TIME we have to EXIT it out like TWICE OR MORE. Yes, I know that there is a premium but A LOT OF PEOPLE doesnt want to PAY MONTHLY for your OWN PERSONAL email even though its only $11.00 including tax too. Make it simple for us..to watch YouTube.."
The advertisements have gotten ridiculous. YouTube is great for discovering new content and has an incredible library of information. I do not recommend anyone use it
"Commercials and Public Service Announcements. I dislike commercials and PSAs popping up right in the middle of a song or video. I also dislike the privacy issues, that you track the sites that I visit"
"A wealth of information. I love YouTube. I can research topics, from medical info to housekeeping hacks. There is also teaching on musical instruments, and other creative endeavors. I can watch music videos. The only complaint I would have is people being mean in the comments. I try to set a good example on this and want to encourage others to be considerate to others"
Ad block. Buy YouTube premium and get no ads. Or how bout I download brave browser and get paid for my data. The aggressiveness with the ads has led me to research a ad block. Found a free alternative and it actually pays me for my data. Took 20 seconds to download. No ads and I get paid
Beware. This app spies on you. Beware This YouTube app uses your data to spy on you across multiple websites and other apps
Freedom of speech violations. Warning the people running this app dont care about your rights and think they need to protect what information and content you watch
Google spies using phone mic. Pretty sure google listen in with your phone microphone and maybe even your phones camera when you watch using the app.Its invasive disgusting behaviour. Your business model stinks googleYou are a filthy stain on our species. Your motto is more than just a bit ironic
Annoying. YouTube was once incredible but over the years it has degraded itself into a disgusting evil that everything has to use. Everyone knows what many of the issues are and they include the ceo and the ads
"Self Professor. Literally learn anything. Word to the wise YouTube will treat you like a high priority client for traversing vast amounts of data via watching of videos I personally learned python3 and many other pen testing, coding, and computing skills. Google has about 30 hours of content get through that you might just see less ads and more love. Peace be with you all.  I need a t shirt that says: I &lt;3 YouTube. Holla atcha boy Boyota Corola if ya have one (;"
Revise you and subscription. YouTube has way too many advertisements I spend more cellular data on ads than I do watching actual videos and paying 1599 a month is an outrageous price Even Netflix is only 999 a month. No one should ever pay $200 a year on so many commercial advertisements commercial advertisements and at this rate you tube cost more than cable for the exact same thing.  Drop your rates and you might actually have more customers. I pay enough for cellular service and internet to the point that paying 3 times to access is pointless
"It is accessing my camera while watching videos. I have no complaints with the content , but the privacy is zero.I have been accesing youtube since years and i neverknew that it acceses camera while watching videos , thanks to apples new feature of green and orange dots which resemble the use of microphone and camera that i came to know that youtube access my camera for nothing . Fix this thing as soon aspossible"
YouTubers. It is the number one priority or not to subscribe to some YouTubers you like or dont like at all but still do it my homies
Privacy and Palestine. Privacy issues. Your bias towards Israel and censoring of Palestinian freedoms gives you one star
"HELLO YOUTUBE ARE YOU THERE???. Theres a new bug where that when you publish a video and you set it to public, f**king youtube decides for you and puts it private anyway.  If you try to put it public and save it, Youtube f**kin says Error saving video data ????????"
"Talk about targeted, everything. Try to be more aware of what privacy youll throwing away while using this app. "
"Once incredible. YouTube is likely my most used app. I imagine it is also in the top 5 most downloaded apps of all time. It is making insane amounts of money. Apparently its not enough to satisfy the greedy bums who own it. Nearly every video you try and watch will be blocked two ads. Then, If youre really unlucky, you might have multiple ads during the video. Did you have a playlist of music videos you wanted to listen to while working or something? Well, screw you, because theres another ad right as your video ends. Some ads are multiple minutes long and can luckily be skipped after five seconds. Were you trying to shower as you had the playlist going. Well, you because you have to reach your wet hand out of the shower to skip the garbage literally no one cares about. The only escape from this absolute garbage is to pay these greedy scoundrels like 25 bucks a month to have no ads. A couple years ago, you might have gotten one ad before a video every three or four videos. Now two ads before every video seems to be manditory. Also, no matter how many times I turn YouTubes offer down to buy YouTube premium, they harass me to buy it several times a week. Advertising is completely ruining my experience with YouTube. The only reason I use it is because there isnt an alternative to me :( two stars"
A Versatile Platform. YouTube works in every way to suit everybodys needs. Whether you want to upload phone and camera videos in private storage or to share or search tutorials and information from around the world. I find YouTube to be the app to use for Sharing and Searching the Best
"Garbage company. I used to be able to log into YouTube and download certain videos on the app so that I can watch them when the WiFi was slow. I logged in today, and every downloaded video now required YouTube Premium in order to access. Im not paying a single cent for that garbage, and Im upset that they changed the rules"
"Invasive. Lately it is more advertising than videos you can watch, it makes you many recommendations that have nothing to do with the ones you usually watch and even if you ask it not to recommend that content, it you complain about the advertising they tell you that you should pay for a premium plan or however they call it how ever when you pay they still sell your user information to advertise outside the platform, it is not a free service at all. It is just another example of what a monopoly do and this is wrong"
"A bug. I love YouTube so much but the problem is, when every time I post my videos today, it says private (and I didnt even press privat) when I try to change it to public, it say error saving data and it wont change to public like what I needed. Help"
"downfall. youtube used to be amazing. now its awful, the whole platform is age restricted and now i cant watch any videos anymore that arent even inappropriate without having to put in my id? its absolutely disgusting. i hope youtube stops getting used and we find another alternative, youtube seems like a sketchy new way of getting peoples data, remove the age restriction and people might start using it again"
"Hey youtube I have a problem. The app is great. Ive met many people on there and have learned so many new things. But I have a small issue. There are so many videos that I want to upload, but when I try to upload it, it privates it Ive made many things for other creators and spent my time on it just for it to go private. When I try to change it to public, it says that it failed to save video data. Please help Heres my account: An_artsy_dork draws"

"Now google sells my information to YouTube. Ok I was looking up Logitech speakers on google bc I was going to buy one. When I went on YouTube all I got were Logitech speaker ads . Why are you selling my info google and YouTube? You are all creeps. Stop nowAlso YouTube needs to stop with the double ads its so annoying. Why are all companies getting worse?. I probably will delete the YouTube app. And just use my pc with an ad blocker. YouTube sends you double ads I GOT A HACK, report the ads and it will close BOTH"
"YOUtube wont CARE ANYWay. But.since your asking.. 1) MAJOR: on any other video app when I collapse and go to my intervener browser in my phone the video Im watching goes micro like Picture in Picture while I surf an watch my program AT THE SAME TIME EVERY OTHER VIDEO APP DOES THIS YOUTUBE DOESNT ITS DUMB.  You selfish idiots seem to think we have to be in your app staring at the screen maximum. Wrong. Its annoying to not be able to surf while my video is tiny in the corner of my phone so I can still watch while I surf or do other things on my phone. And if you dont agree with me you should be fired now. Why..? Because your goal is to have me watching too app as max as possible.. so wouldnt that entail not closing the video while do other things on my phone. SomeOf us are multitaskers and watch videos while we do other things.. duh 2) stop your censoring 3) woke cultire is not god, and neither is yoir channel stop acting like it. Your losing viewers, creators and supporters, because your all way way to woke. 4) grow up you woke progressive babies"
Privacy concerns with recent UI refresh (not update). This week the UI changed. Functions at bottom were resequenced and a stream live button added1. Have not found a way to control camera access this app now. (Thought there was one)2. Found now way to remove or disable this featureAs app pointed out. Am not a YouTuber etc. does not function. So why put such a security risk. Without sufficient controls felt and center on apps used by persons of all cognitive capabilities etcPlease remove now
You need to fix a lot. Its creepy how you have all the data mining marketing. Its rude I hate the service you demonize videos not worthy of demobilization yall are trying to become a kids tv show when it should be about everyone making content for everyone
Brought to you by Goolag. Terrible censorship app which violates any and all privacy of its users
"Home page. Please stop suggesting videos Ive already watched on the home page, a couple is ok but not the majority of the recommendations. When I watch a video, suggest similar things, or more videos from that creator, not a video for something unrelated that Ive already watched, thats just dumb. Also please stop using data from other websites to recommend things Ive looked up, thats creepy, you might think its such an innovative idea and will definitely keep people watching videos (which means more ad money) but its very obvious and deeply unnerving, I can see why people stop using google. (I turned off targeted ads for this reason but idk if you can do that for recommended videos.)"
So convenient. I love the fact that I can save videos and audios to listen to them later without taking up all the memory of my phone. YouTube remembers the music I like and makes accurate suggestions. It is like having my personal DJ who knows me from a long time ago.  I dont even watch TV anymore
"As far as the app goes, it is fine. But the admins are extremely Democratic. This will never get featured, but it is still important to note that YouTube is extremely biased to the Democratic Party, and will usually demonetize, delete, or take any other enforcement action they can to hinder a creator that expresses any republican views. This is an issue because it is an open platform that should not take political sides. Recently they threatened to take enforcement action on a channel for breaking a privacy policy by posting a video in which they showed a tweet of a person telling them to kill their entire family and then themselves. The person who sent that tweet then reported the Youtubers video and YouTube threatened enforcement. They also ensure CNN and other notably left news agencies (in particular the ones that do not tell the truth) as well as creators who are clearly Democratic, are always on the front page of the app, and they put shadowbans on republican channels, as well as silently unsubscribing you, turning off your notifications for those channels, suspending them, etc"
"COMMERCIALS R Destroying YouTube. I have to carefully select what I watch due to wireless and data charges. Commercials are adding to the equation. Used to be able to skip commercials. More frequently, one is forced to watch them. Also, my viewing time is important to me. More and more, YouTube is becoming stark commercialism"
"Data Monetization. Most annoying things companies do. Can we get paid for part of our info going out. Lol I love the app, I use it too much"
"YouTube. You Tube is a revolutionary application for many. It is the medium of communication, entertainment and knowledge. For many it is the source of income. Please keep free access (subscription) available so many underprivileged people can still access it to gain knowledge, wisdom and strength. It is entirely up-to the user how they use it. Your YouTube history reflects your character and personal traits. Autoplay function works little iffy sometimes. Maybe a BUG to fixxx"
"Authoritarian Censor loving app. Was a great app until they got really creepy and started picking and choosing what they want people to say, stealing peoples incomes, and doing the bidding of the globalist world empire. Im fed up and done using and until we all get off YouTube and get on alternatives they will continue to hold their power. Use if you want to be spied on"
"Needs privacy enhancement. The YouTube Apple TV app needs 4 digit PIN numbers for multi-user privacy without  having to type full passwords, similar to the Netflix and Facebook Watch Apple TV apps"
"Adverts are killing the app. I still enjoy using YouTube (to a degree), but the number and length of adverts are getting silly now. I get that you need to make your money back for running the service, but its getting to the point that Im looking at alternatives now. £15 a month for just hosting other peoples videos is just a joke, not forgetting the fact that Google is still mining all of our data via this app too. I honestly hope that Apple makes their own YouTube competitor, because Googles getting lazy and greedy"
"Youtube treats creators and viewers like morons. Id hate to be the these people are triggered snowflakes guy but, the people are Youtube are a bunch of triggered snowflakes. The algorithm for recommending videos is 1000x worse compared to how it was when the app was new. theyve disabled the number of dislikes on Youtube videos to keep people from getting offended under the basis that Data supports: users will most likely click on a video anyway despite the dislike number.. Which totally goes to show they have no real sense of how the context of this data was retrieved. If a video comes out searched for or recommended because of their terrible algorithm or a questionable creator whos failures are trending, of course their video will get views regardless of dislikes. And the attitude Youtube has towards its users during this forceful change goes as this: Yeah it may take some time to get used to, but youll get used to it.-pretty much a quote from Youtubes update video on the issue. They treat users like morons and cattle. At this point, the only thing thats keeping this app alive, is the actual video creators. If they were to somehow move to another video app all at once, this other app would IMMEDIATELY be vastly superior"
"Bring back our 67MIL. Delete views so that paid content is trending higher, tampering with view data to influence billboard charting, overall unfair treatment of popular creators and a legitimate gold mine of pedophiles and copyright law manipulators, warped censorship rules and disconnected from users"
"YouTube? Get vanced. This app is emblematic of the platform - it ignores your privacy, takes away all power and control from both content creators and consumer, and will never, ever, stop giving you pop ups to upgrade to premium"
"Hey, Stob It. Youtube is stealing and deleting views from people that stream BTSs music videos. Why wont they just leave them alone? The views mean a lot to ARMY and BTS, and theres really no point to deleting them, either. The people want the videos to stream"
This app listens to your conversations. Listens to your conversations even when your phone is locked. Also displays terrible content over and over despite my attempts at hiding them and refreshing.Main video feed consistently and repeatedly display grossly inappropriate ads titled how to spy on others messages And how I made thousands from sitting at home. Clearly YouTube has no conscience in regards to filtering out spam advertisements and would rather just make money at the expensive of vulnerable users.Swipe up main feed to refresh? You mean rearrange the same videos Ive already seen over and over
"Absolute Trash. Waste of my data showing me ads, claiming that its keeping youtube free, meanwhile they have a $14/subscription serviceExplain this to me now"
Intellectual properties abuse. I would give 5 stars if they didnt steal/share so much of our personal information
"ads are ridiculous. youtube is a great app but over the years has slowly been favoring the users less and the companies more. the amount of ads is incredible, you cant even watch a thirty second video without getting bombarded with double unskippable ads. i use it all the time, but really youtube? you constantly try to update user experience but its always worse afterwards. not to mention that its impossible to discover new creators. it used to be a five star app but now i hesitate to use it"
Disgusting Ads Ruin The App. No I dont have any personal hygiene issues and dont wish to see your disgusting ads. Nothing is too low for this despicable company. Deleting the app due to incessant vile ad spamming by Google
"About the update in December 10. Okay, so I really need to cover this up and that problem in December 10 is about the Update where COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection act) Ruins tons of youtubers works where family friendly channels, Gaming channels, etc. is ruined because of the Childrens Online Privacy protection If you are reading this (The childrens Online Privacy Protection Act), Im very very disappointed with you ruining our videos even though there is a YouTube Kids app where kids can watch. Thank you for the damage you done to Youtube COPPA. Edit: Now people will hate you for the things you made, COPPA. You do realize you also ruined pretty much of what others did. This is why YouTube will be *Censored* up.Edit (Again): If you do this Youtube, most of the YouTube channels will go somewhere else to make videos, even me (CarlosYT Gamer, which will plan to go to dailymotion or other apps that are similar to YouTube except YouTube Kids) so, please youtube, dont add the COPPA thing into here, watch those videos that are against COPPA and those are starting to shut themselves down because of this Im gonna stop using this on January 1 2020 just like SuperBowserLogan.Edit as of 2020: alright Susan Wojcicki, you may want to comply with this: I need to tell you that now that you disabled skipping ads for signed out users and made ads more annoying than ever making them appear in more than 75% of all the YouTube videos so far. Can you make those people to give a cooldown when they overbuy the ads, seriously its extremely annoying #SignedOutLivesMatter"
The Greatest. YouTube is the Google for all generation. Anything Everything All things just click away at your convenience. I thank you very much for your awesome service throughout the entire globe. Who knows maybe other planets in the universe might tapping into your network lol YouTube rocks keeping it coming guys Happy HolidaysYouTube thank you for all you do. Creating the most ultimate amazing incredible awesome apps. Having access full circle lifestyle anything and everything we could imagine is unbelievable. Keep it coming making this apps worldwide first class network above all. 
Intense and spying. I love YouTube but my recommendations are way too serious. When I check out a channel and watch ONE video it gives me so many recommendations for that channel and videos like it. I miss the old YouTube were it would give you multiple different things to watch :(
"Used to be great. I used to love this app, but now its terrible. EVERYTHING is age restricted, its very hard to watch certain things and many things that shouldnt have been age restricted have been. The age restriction policy has absolutely ruined it and Im considering deleting the app. There is always the option to send ID but Im not doing that because thats an invasion of my privacy and it has to be done every age restricted video that I would like to watch, DO NOT RECOMMEND, please sort this out, YouTube is made for older people and people who can watch age restricted videos, you are slowly turning YouTube into YouTube kids, which it is not. Do better"
you are very dumb. YouTube please look around Your app more there is people in the app SCAMMING children for free Robyn or vbucks children dont know that its not real and dont know better... you dont do anything about it you dont understand how stressful it is to people when kids see some free money website scam. You delete channels for harassment WHEN THERE IS PEOPLE GETTING THEIR DATA STOLEN BECAUSE OF YOU NOT DOING ANYTHING
"Watch out youtube is recording your every move. I would love to give youtube 5 stars but heres the thing. Watch out, as I was watching a tv show (dance moms) on youtube and then went into tiktok and saw that in my for you page that there were Dance moms  related things. This was the first time that happened and I only just recently started watching dance moms. This proves that big social media companies are selling information to other companies so be careful. Make up fake information so that those companies dont have your private information and who knows they could be watching us through the camera of our devices or even be listening to our conversations. If your working at youtube and watching this... STOP SENDING ME THESE DUMB SIMPY PIANO ADDS AND SOME RANDOM CHINA ADDS THEY ARE THE ONLY ADDS I GET THST IS CREEPY .. THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD KNOW THAT I PLAYED AN INSTRUMENT IS IF YOU TAKE ALL MY DATA FROM MY SEARCHES WHICH IS STUPID. WHY DO YOU KEEP SENDING ME THESE CHINESE PEOPLE PLAYING A GAME. WHY JUST STOP IT WITH THESE ADDS YOU STALKERS... ok I know your not a stalker but you make me feel like your company is. BTW I watched a video on a youtuber who got hacked and got no useful help until over 6 months. WHICH PROVE THAT YOUR STAFF NEEDS TO STEP IT UP AND GET A BRAIN"

Internet. I love youtube and it never used to tell me i needed to be connected to wifi to watch or do anything and i could use my cell data now i cant even log in without wifi and watch anything how is that fair ???? My app is up to date and i have the newest iphone please fix this issue
Cant turn off the political ads. Its really annoying to see the trumping ads on YouTube front page every time I use the app. There is no way to turn if off and I felt my privacy has been corrupted. I really hope YouTube can respect my rights and let me choose what ads I dont want to see. Such a disappointment
"LACK OF PRIVACY. If you choose to use the app in incognito mode, they automatically turn off incognito mode within a day due to lack of activity. Its DISGUSTING. F Google and their anti privacy abuses"
"YouTube Caters to People With Subscribers. You allow people who have purchased a bunch of subscribers Bully smaller channels. You have allowed Tasha K to bully other channels but do nothing about her and her content You even gave her other peoples personal info so that she can bully them outside of YouTube. So no, I dont like you right now and as soon and the channels I enjoy find other avenues Im right with them"
Google is spyware. just check out what data they collect now that they have to list itway too much info being taken from you
Pushing white supremacy propaganda. No matter how many times I use stop seeing this ad or any other Google settings I continue to be bombarded with white supremacy propaganda ads.  Its bad enough these bad actors are given a platform but being hounded by these ads is unacceptable. You collect data yet cant seem to utilize that data.Edit: Wish I could go half a star.  The alt right propaganda this platform pushes is insane
Amazing but. YouTube app is really good as you can track what you watch on YouTube but the only problem is how you spam with the ads to try make people buy YouTube premium not everyone is going to but you should not spam with ads that just makes people hate youtube
Used to be great. Ever since the release of the paid subscription you have increased the adds. It is sad. Google greediness at its finest. You already steal all our personal information just to use your services so we shouldnt be forced to watch ads or have to pay not to.  Big corporation greed at its finest
No thanks to Google. I give this App a 1 star because they dont offer a No star rating. First thing I really like YouTube its a awesome way to fined music information and so on. And it could be the best App ever. But its not why because no thanks to Google and its sneaky way of tracking people. The app is always running in the back ground even when you are not using it. It seems Google is dead set on violating your privacy. No matter how you set your privacy settings Google still tracks everything you search and more. So sad that you have to sing into Goggle when you just want to enjoy YouTube. With no red tape I dont recommend this phone battery sucking up app Thanks to Google
YouTube has made terrible decisions. Literally filled with ads and you cant watch anything without them stealing your data. The vertical ads make it 10x worse and for some reason the app keeps suggesting hour long videos that I dont want to watch. I wish I could give it 0 stars
Too many ads now. I love the app and love searching for info that a private individual has published about something Im interested in. But it has declined in the past 2 years where its all about monetizing the content in advertising and placement. How can we remove those features? Not as good as it was
Wow. Im definitely downloading ad blockers and downloading a hacked app version of YouTube cause to be real with you your ads are starting to get annoying Im legit getting 4 ads in one video I cant even watch a 2 minute video without being forced to watch 4 ads thats like 5 minutes total just to watch a tiny short video this is insanely ridiculous but its ok you do you and Ill do me and not support you and just use blockers and a different app not made by you thank you very much for alternatives
"Restricted mode. I never had a problem with YouTube until recently, when restricted mode turned on for my phone. When loading the app on data, comments are hidden and so is some content. When Im on wifi, its perfectly fine. YouTube, please fix this because its infuriating to deal with. I literally cannot turn it off, for data mode"
"Good video that collects your personal info. Google collects your personal info and censors content under management of socialist mafia. Otherwise, works"
Google Spy. I just wish this app wasn&#39;t another tool for Google&#39;s spies to sell our personal information and target ads at us
"Should be able to rate ads, what a concept. And commenting on a video takes forever. You would think feedback on videos would be high priority but I guess selling ads is higher. Youd think in a democracy, where freedom of speech is a right, we could provide feedback on ads just like we can on content. But no this is YouTube, anti democratic, anti freedom of speech"
Incredible Access. YouTube provides access to all kinds of programs and shows. What a revolutionary platform
Too many ads. Too many ads that don&#39;t allow you to skip through them. Stealing my data
"Cannot upload videos. Thanks to google needing every tidbit of information on their users, there is no way to upload videos without giving access to all photos, videos, microphone, camera, and location access at all times. This has become a privacy nightmare"
"YouTube. I like this app but I just HATE THE ADS When you visit sites and things on the internet, it collects your data to then put ads in the videos you watch and it gets SUPER ANNOYING Besides that, this is a great app to entertain yourself"
"Censorcity. An organization (Google) along with other similarly run Multi-national monopoly Corporations that are rejecting the very foundations of liberty, honesty, integrity, and decency that have allowed the world to come out from slavery, autocratic and oligarchic oppression and the world history of tyranny, to build and sustain a free society where the individuals welfare and rights, no matter how powerless, have a voice in ending the inevitable corruption and exploitation that comes from too much of a power in the hands of a small elite group. These woke tyrants do not care about anyone or anything but the advancement of their own power and self-interest. They really have no concept of, let alone the capacity for authentic love or personal sacrifice that built these institutions they seek to dismantle. Sad and tragic"
"Administrative restrictions ruined my experience. I always use YouTube but suddenly my personal account is under administrative restrictions? My account isnt connected with a g suite yet youtube somehow found a way to put restrictions on my account. I cant comment or even read comments on most videos, some videos I cant even get access to. I follow more mature content on YouTube so this has completely ruined the app for me, Ive been looking to try to fix it but its not even disabled across platforms but just on my phone Happy I decided against paying for YouTube Red because clearly I cant even watch what I want to watch when I want to watch it"
Censorship is evil. Why are you censoring political and medical information? Why are you promoting a personal agenda? That is really very unprofessional. It is a form of dishonesty and manipulation
"YouTube is great but. Its a great platform but its a shame they likely are still mining our data and probs give it to the CIA super computers. We are compliant still though, so why complain . Plus, their question to join their premium service keeps popping up even though I say no every time I use it during one day. "
Adverts adverts adverts. YouTube used to be such an incredible resource for anyone to access. Now its a minefield of intrusive advertising and expensive requests for a membership
"Removing legitimate views. YouTube has a consistent policy of removing views/un-validating views, specifically from foreign artists. There have been several examples of this and its beginning to look xenophobic and racist. I have had my personal views of videos be removed from my library that were watched days apart"
"Cowards. Bring back the dislikes, no more age verification nonsense that requires giving youtube very personal info, no more long ads, no more childrens adverts when you have a kids app, no more scam adverts"
"Pro-Trump Propaganda Tool. Pretty sad when even Facebook has more standards when it comes to rightwing propaganda And talking about matters which are not only blatantly false but dangerous like QanonCancelled my YouTube premium and stopped using google tooIn addition, no way to turn off data tracking - theyre monetizing youre more than one way...  ALL ABOUT THE $$$"
"Too many ads. I realize the necessity of ads with free apps but you should really take the time to write algorithms that start ads at a break in videos, not right in the middle of a word.Interestingly, when I watch YouTube in my web browser on my computer I hardly ever have ads in the middle of video playback...I love YouTube, fix the issue with when ads play and its a 4* app. Eliminate ads altogether and its a 5* app. Sorry but no app with forced ads gets 5* rating.Dropped the rating to 1* as now most ads cant even be skipped after 5 seconds anymoreUPDATE:Why dont my subscriptions and notifications sync across all of my devices when Im logged onto the same account on them all?Why am I getting random stories at the top of my feed. Theyre not related to my YouTube searches and I dont want to see these people.Youre blowing it and thats why other platforms are picking up.I have to dismiss the data and privacy notification EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP, once should be enough"
"Cheaters. They delete views off of perfectly fine videos that are being watched, just so they dont get rid of the records of others. Its just a toxic app"
Fraud. This application is coming from hackers. Check out the privacy policy. The most recent privacy agreement from Google Inc was March 31st 2020. The agreement for this application is 2012....  eight years ago. So many of these apps are being downloaded from Saml data bases and are written with scripts that inject info into your mobile. They are then able to steal and control your cell phone and any accounts connected to it. They are able to obtain information from the most personal accounts
"You need to stop forcing your garbage on people. You make your service almost unwatchable with the number of advertisements you force me to watch. It seems like an attempt to coerce me into paying for YouTube premium which promises no commercials. The problem is, you control and censor what Im allowed to watch or upload, and you push your agenda on me and many others. Why would I pay for that? And lets not forget that after some time, you will start innocuously injecting your quick little ads back into the premium service just like Amazon Prime has done. The only reason youre getting 1 star, is in order for me give you a review, I have to select 1. You would have much more accurate data if you allowed for negative stars. Stop dictating what I can and cannot watch or say, turn off your algorithms and stop asking me to take surveys"
"I Am Once Again Asking Youtube to STOP Making Changes. Youtube now added a different way to change the quality on videos. Instead of just showing all the options we can pick between, \auto,\ \higher picture quality,\ and \data saver.\ I picked \higher picture quality\ since I have unlimited data or am home watching videos. Well for some reason Youtube thinks \higher picture quality\ means 720p. We now have videos streaming at 4k so I dont know why Youtube has to pick 720p as the \higher quality.\ Even when videos only have 1080p Youtube still goes to 720p, and when I change to 1080p it only applies to the video I am currently watching. At this point I am moving fully to my desktop to watch videos. Along with having adblock there is no competition"
"Annoying ads. Will we ever escape the annoyance of unwanted and inappropriate interruptions ? It is a matter of privacy. I no more want ads than I want uninvited people in my house. Oh, I have heard the arguments of lazy people who only know, If it works best it to death. Ads are already dead and break the context and flow of an earlier model on which they ride like sucker fish. Ads are parasitic and a show of the imagineless among us who care nothing more that does the adman who places a billboard in the curve. Soulless people. Now YouTube has decided what I will be seeing. I am tiring of it and will soon find alternatives. Now I have no way to see anything that you dont want me to see"
Horrible App and Horrible media to sign up for. I have been a YouTube member since 2010. I have never commented nor have I did anything malicious to any other videos or anything I only listen to music and watch funny videos that were sent to me from my friends and family. Now remind you they just now terminated my account and stated that I was harassing and bullying and saying things that was inappropriate when I noticed that my Google account was hacked into from another location when my stuff was stolen including my phone and I was held at gun point and got beaten up all of my things was stolen at that time as me and my husband try to regain everything I lost however weeks later after I updated al of my info and added more security to my Gmail account I noticed I gotten an email from YouTube blocking my account. I was very very upset however I appealed and they still terminated my account after I told them it wasnt me who has stolen anything even though I have proof of police reports and hospital reports it wouldnt allow me to submit a scanned copy of documents to show them proof that my phone was even stolen at the time when this happened. So they still terminated my account even though there is proof that I had updated my passwords to everything and I had relogged into YouTube at the time BEFORE they terminated my account and I had no idea this had happened. My husband stated that he will have to research and see if he can get information thats above them however its a done deal even though I havent done anything. So YouTube has lost a lot of cool points with my thusfar I wasted money on my subscriptions I paid for and they refused to refund me so there you go a waste. If I could give them a zero start I would
"I love YouTube . Ive been using YouTube for over a year now, and besides a couple ads every day I wouldnt change a thing about it I mean I use YouTube for a couple hours a day and theres never any problems I can watch off like I can like watch on the data so yeah its its amazing"
Google being Petty. Google took away the picture and picture due to their greed and the need to flood users with two 15 second long ads before a two minute video. The ads are getting longer and longer.  This app is useless now. Im guessing Apple angered them when they made it obvious when Google tracks users movements through sites. Moving back to the browser with ad block. Bye ads
Data mining. Whatever I watch on YouTube I can guarantee there will be a related ad on my other devices within a minute. Not trying to be an information slave so you can add to your billions. This should be illegal
"just wanna enjoy the content creators .  love the app... i pay for Premium*** warning *** over last three weeks, and now this update, the quantity of unsolicited ads &amp; so-called featured forced junk have drastically increasedeverytime app is opened there are now another hundred unwanted spam:suggestions... ie, content not wanted.  ...the ad-limit controls no longer function; scroogle is crossing the line worse than fekbook now scraping data from histories across all OS apps &amp; browsers, it definitely listens to device mics on iPhones just like scamazons echo and scroogles alexaso be aware.  installing this app makes device security something everyone needs to be aware.where is GDPR enforcement ? Dear Google ...for premium subscription fees, customers expect capability to stop any and all spam; especially yer fekn politcal ads and sales gimmicslisten to our voices; and stop eaves-dropping"
"Lots of tracking. I never noticed how much tracking Google actually did. After moving to opera browser leaving a vpn on and iOS privacy enhancements and disabling tracking YouTube videos literally dont even open because Its trying so desperately to shove a catered ad into my face. So it just wont open the video until it finds an ad for like a minute, half a minute. Its sad"
YouTube is a teacher. I have found so many informative videos on YouTube that has expanded My personal knowledge as well as knowledge for My business. Its Information that I dont have to pay for. Thats incredible. I hope more ppl upload more videos that will take ppl as far in life as the need and want to go
Murdermerk. You tube continues to allow him to harass and bullying people on YouTube giving out personal information telling others to attack
:(. I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate the ads google is the worst company eveeeeeeeeeeeeeer and they spy on us
"Ad riddled, dysfunctional trash. 1, 2 or 3 ads around every corner. This is in addition to the ads within videos. Limited and broken functionality despite monetising one like a farm animal. Zero privacy, zero decency, zero courtesy and one hundred percent Google"
"YouTube stop thinking about money. GET THE FAKE bot comments And spam bots and, improve your media app, by getting rid of sub bots also, or terminate the channel that keeps hacking on there subscribers to want to be famous and unoriginal that uses sub bot hacks and or terminate there account permanently or use a higher security login captcha and 2 step verification code, for identification so the bots wont create a random account and send malware/fraud stealing personal information and debit/credit card info. Get it together, your media is goin downhill like crazy, all those other videos that say how to get coin/gem for free by using the generator hack system, or download this like a sample cydia, the easy way in iOS and sending a link to a fake website that its not gonna work. Please take down those videos Please its full of bots in the comments and get rid of them, humans only tend to use this appSincerely gxthic roses"
"Extra rules on videos made for kids are idiotic. I love the YouTube app, but its really frustrating when I want to view a video flagged as made for kids, but my viewing options are restricted, even though Im not a kid. My main issue is the disabling of comments and the MiniPlayer for videos such as these. I read YouTubes reason for these restrictions, and it seems it is to help protect kids privacy on the internet. I cant wrap my head around how disabling the miniplayer for me, an adult, protects a kids privacy. If you want to disable these features for kids then I guess I can understand but I dont know why I am not allowed to enjoy the videos I want at full capacity, when I am beyond the age where I need to be protected from foul content"
Google please fix this or ima have to sue. So when I was watching YouTube videos and I randomly just got kicked out of YouTube and this has been going on for 2 days now. Im telling you fix it or ima have to sue. If your on a computer it would work for you because yall use the site ( thats what I use so Im thinking people use it to? )Well ya back to what I was saying if your on a computer rising the site it would work for you. This is sad because I have to use the site and sometimes my data does not work. IM TELLING YOU IMA HAVE TO SUE HONEY BOO BOO. Anyways thx for reading this ya sweetie I gave the 1 star. Watch ya gonna do huh youtube?
Just making things more difficult. Besides the problems that YouTube has with not listening to community you have now made a other problem first you changed where the comment section was now that wasnt really bad we got used to it but now you switch the quality settings you have made it significantly more difficult for us because it doesnt show a number we were already content with you showing numbers of quality but with words its harder for us to understand what video quality we have and Im pretty sure any person with a brain cell who can use YouTube would know that the lower the quality less data you use I am simply appalled that you would not even take a survey of people just to see if it was easier and harder but instead just go with your own trick and just ruin it I am greatly disappointed in the change you made so I request you please change this back to normal because you are making it significantly worse for users to use and above all is harder hope this gets through your skull
I like it.. they just need to take a good care of user privacy. I like it. They just need to take a good care of user privacy
"Garbage. Not only do they make u sit through tons of add, they also mine data from your phone and sell it to others. They are absolutely a garbage company and if you want to watch YouTube, do it through Brave browser. Wouldnt surprise me to find out that YouTube sold my data to those trying to sell me a car warranty"
Bring back the views. BRING BACK THE VIEWS YOU STOLE FROM BTS.  should focus on blocking videos that spread hate and fake news than in a music group that sends a love message through their music. Wow YouTube  your priorities
Unauthorized access to my photos. Although I had YouTubes apps permission to my photos to set never it still has an access to it no matter however I had it blocked.  Slowly attempting to sneak it into your privacy matters.  Its Wrong
Bots. Lately theres been a TON bot accounts doing a a lot of spam that is trying to hack into YouTube HQ and other people accounts.also theses bot accounts hack other peoples channel and if a someone subscribes to a bots channel they hack it to get the user that sub to them to get their personal information
Never can show a good video to save its life. - trys to get me to watch news I dont care about.        * non-removable.-gives me pop-ups. Like a virus even when I have purchased YouTube premium.         * non-removable. Incredibly annoying. A huge eyesore-no matter how many times I click not interested or I dont like this video on a video it will keep suggesting to me the same channel even though I say do not suggest this channel again.-ive had to fight with it for years to get actual get decent videos on my feed. The algorithms are garbage. They seem like they only favor data per a particular region. Isolating videos per state.-no matter how much you complain. No matter who you talk to. Nothing changes. No one cares. Customer service is equivalent to asking an AI chat bot how your day is been going
"Ads ads ads. After every video they send you to the paid for next one, even if it has NOTHING to do with what youre watching. And theres 2 ads between every vid now. Someone needs to start up a rival video watching service please that is not owned by money grabbing pos I always run out of data and is because 40% of it is fkin adverts"
"Bend over for google. If you down load this app google is going to  -View your browser history - third party cookies ( SoOther companies can track you as well ) - they track you using web beacons, tracking pixels, browser fingerprinting - they reserve the right to disclose you personal info with out notifying you -they can use your content for all their existing and future services . Everything they do is shady and misleading Dont download the app just use it on your browser and clear your cookies in browser history before and after each useWill help maintain a little less of the stranglehold they have most of the world"
"Censorship like you would expect in the old USSR or current Chinese government ridiculous. David Seaman from Fulcrum, Alex Jones, And countless others censored / deleted / eliminated theres no free speech on this thing at all ..thats why were lucky to have alternatives to YouTube. It should be noted that all of the data that has been deleted or in various main frame areas one in Southern California near the border"
censorship makes this less usable. unfortunately the endless censoring of sites on here makes it impossible to trust ANY of the data and information i read on this site. my knowing that 1/2 of data is not allowed and worse hesitant to be spoken about makes for  zero balance and reduces this to a simple left-leaning mouthpiece. sad really as i used to be able to see and read both sides then decide for myself. My kids even notice the heavy bias here
"Quality C**KBlockers. Hey, so Ive now had the pleasure of going through dozens of youtube mobile updates over the years. This data blocking has gone on long enough. Starting about a year ago or less, they came out with an update making it more difficult to view a video in 1080p by having to click through an extra window in every video to force the player to let you view it at 1080p. PRESUMABLY this was done to help stabilize their entire platform as with nearly everyone able to view 1080p from a mobile standpoint, the data being pinged from their servers must be in-numerous. That being said I didnt mind clicking an extra time to get my precious 1080p quality. Im here writing this review because they went 1 step further and COMPLETELY REMOVED THE 1080P QUALITY OPTION FROM MOBILE. ummmm..excuse me? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT AWAY. THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.Through every single update Youtube has ever had I have always thought, Man, they updated, at least they are improving the service I NEVER ONCE IMAGINED THEY WOULD TRULY TRULY TRULY DOWNGRADE A PLATFORM WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DEVICES VIEWING THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF CONTENT PER SECOND JUST TO SATISFY THE ~30% OR LESS OF PEOPLE WATCHING ON A PC"
Its a spying app. It will collect data about you. Use your browser for YouTube- they cant collect your data then
"resolution setting is BAD. maybe the US internet is so good that google thinks the rest the world should also always watch video in HD or at least 720p by default even with Data saver turned on, also the setting way more difficult for users to change the resolution in the latest update..how is forcefully making users watch vid using more data gonna get youtube further?"
"My upload on Gacha Life is private when I try to upload it on YouTube can you fix this?. So, Ive been trying to post a few videos about Gacha life, but when I try to upload my video it says that its private when it should be public. I try to edit it to make it public but when I save it, it just says error saving data, on the video. I dont know if this is a glitch or bug, but if it is, can you please fix it?. Thank you for reading my review"
"Best Video Sharing app out there... at the moment. YouTube is the biggest and best video sharing platform there is. Ads are never to long (20-30 seconds) and ads that are longer can be skipped 5 seconds in. Videos are of a high quality with fantastic creators and influencers, who could entertain you for hours upon hours. In addition to independent creators and their devoted fans there are most of the big entertainment companies , that show full episodes and highlights of their shows. Data collection is (in my opinion) the best part of YouTube; google takes you YouTube history, search history and location to personalise videos that you may like. So, remember to turn on data collection and turn off auto delete so google knows what you enjoy watching, specifically remember to put location on so YouTube can find creators near you YouTube premium is also a great investment, with no ads and exclusive shows. Remember to subscribe to it, I couldnt recommend it any more.YouTube is the best app for video sharing. Owned by the best company google"
"Biased app. You tube is good for so many reasons. I just wish theyd stop censoring people and removing videos so many people love because some hate it. There is good and bad information on the app but thats because there is good and bad information everywhere. Id love for all information to be available. Even things I hate. My favorite person on here hasnt even received his 1,000,000 view play button. Hes received more than that on many videos and his videos get taken down. Shout out to Rucka Rucka Ali. Please give him his well deserved play button already He is literally one of 3 people I regularly watch on this app"
YouTube is good even if I use Wifi or data but. I rate 1 star because YouTube is unfair they always cut BTS MV views especially for Their latest MV ON. Its got for 98M+ views. Thanks
"Annoying ads. Will we ever escape the annoyance of unwanted and inappropriate interruptions ? It is a matter of privacy. I no more want ads than I want uninvited people in my house.

Bad interface & Privacy issues. Crappy UI makes it confusing and difficult to navigate. Scammy & Deceptive ads. Plus all the Google privacy & tracking concerns... no sir didnt like it
WiFi. So you cant use YouTube anymore on phone personal hotspot it will never load watching it or transferring it on your television
"Several problems. Using YouTube is good, but it clears ALL DATA every time you update this app"
"Unless you pay for RED, just use Safari. The app doesnt do anything well that the browser doesnt do except the app tracks your every interaction and constantly moves things around.Just use the website. The only benefit of the app is to people who pay for no ads / RED / Premium. No need to let Google creep on you - at least Safari does some protection"
F*k you. Great source of information if you support the suppression of free speech and technological oppression
Worst app no privacy. I used to enjoy but now a days they are nude ads which we cant even block
What are you doing?. I got youtube premium recently because of your relentless ad bombardment and turns out when i delete a video i downloaded its data stays on my iPhone my YouTube app is currently taking up 15 gb of my system and the only way to fix it is to delete the app and redownload and that resets all my settings i have to manually re select each one do you know how annoying that is? Just fix it
INS Independent News Service. YouTube has been a wealth of independent news service like The TV series Kolchak the night stalker We have seen incredible miraculous message and events that got right to people some times within minutes of the event We the people of the world have turned to YouTube as a reliable independent source of information Remember the Messiah told us the truth shall set you free Thank you YouTube remember we have been lied to about the real events in history that took place from people who had and still have the power to add change or take away important factual evidence in history science and religion That is treacherous and that deserves redemption because we are being fed many false narratives Things like science that says there is no God and nor is there advanced intelligences in the universes well we know better dont we YouTube God bless your every step in sending mankind to Freedom good job and good luck YouTube Sincerely yours Film Writer / Author RLG
Still has bugs. I have used this app for years on my iPhones but for some strange reason here in 2021 it has become very buggy it uses way to much Data and lately it will not off load when I request it too. Unfortunately its becoming more like a control thing. Like Facebook is and i dont trust it. So if I can not control the app and off load them at my will. I think its time to look elsewhere for a information app that I can control 100 percent. After all its my phone I own it. So sad because I use to enjoy YouTube more than any other app on my phone
YouTube es increíble. Your asome for not allowing to watch private vids and al things
"There are supposed to be ADS . People are complaining about ads there has to be ads so people will by there products. Im so sick of people complaining about it ADS barely pop up so I think you should deal with it, its part of life. Its like tv EXCEPT you can search up what you want to watch, AND it even has less ads then normal tv, so quit complaining about it, btw I recommend this app to all, btw you can also buy YouTube premium so there wont be ads so please dont get mad at the makers they try there best to do this, and it must have been really hard to make an app like this so why dont you try and see how hard it is to make an app this good. And millions of people love this app so be careful what you say there human to and have feelings like normal human beings. You should appreciate this app being created there would be no YouTube stars at all. Respect the person or people that made it, If you are reading this I know your thinking I think you made your point, but its an incredible app and Im very impressed. If you HATE it then why download it"
"Please Read Google. I cannot lock my desired resolution across all videos Please trust that there are still plenty of intelligent users who DO NOT NEED you to decide what video quality is best for their circumstances. Its annoying when I play a video in the background that for no good reason gets set on full HD, then using up more data, than using up more battery life, which causes video lag and I constantly have to correct WHILE IM DRIVING 5G is not as reliable as yall seem to believe"
Deleting Views. A lot of people including me were trying to beat the record of most views on BTS new music video ON  and we were on track to beat it until YOUTUBE DELETED 60+ MILLION VIEWS And then again another 5 million and so on and so forth These are actual people viewing the videos not bots we are just trying to beat our own record but we cant when YOUTUBE DELETES SO MANY VIEWS
"Love it, BUT. I constantly watch YouTube every day. I think its better than tv, however, please please if the powers that be are reading this. Stop the constant adverts in between videos. I understand that people make money from these, but I counted an advert once every 20 seconds on a few videos Ive watched lately. This is worse than watching sky TV on a premiere programme thats just been aired. I gave up in the end watching the videos as I honestly lost track in what I was watching in the first place"
TOO MANY ADS. One cannot watch any tube without a plethora of unwanted ads. I dont watch You Tube much anymore because of the ads.Update: 4/11/21. It would be nice if You Tube would be as forthcoming with what they want to UPDATE as Google is selling our information.Very poor thought process on the programmers part. Not all of us are stupid
"Very bad. I stopped using YouTube, the repeated Adv on the website consumed our internet data"
Garbage. Way to many adds and google spying
i rate it a 3. i rate it 3 because when i posted something today it went private and when i try to make it public. it stays private. i want to change it so people can see my videos and im trying to find a way to take it off but I cant. There is no privacy setting to turn it off. Can u please help cuz I want to post videos of what I love but with private I cant
Delete. Deletes views. If they cant handle the views their getting then they need to seriously improve their data tracking
"The original and the best. You Tube is a streaming service like no other. My memory is capable of storing a lot of detailed information such as the names, titles, producer, lyrics, labels, etc so it is only with thanks to the terramonstrous amount of recorded, streamed, uploaded, downloaded, synced and stored data that You Tube have made available that it is a service that is received effortlessly and something and extremely enjoy using and exploring and will 9.5/10 return with what I am searching for and although in our changed and now very digital world it can be seen sometimes as a risk as to what you tap or click on given the link you need in order to hear, watch and see what you are looking for given exposure to malware amd viruss etc, I really am at this stage of the game truly believe You Tube and the people that have made and produced it into the service I use have my privacy and security as something they consider as a priority and something of importance to its members, users and subscribers and seem to always be delivering a selection and variety that leaves any other streaming service in a category that comes no where near as close as to the ability, variety, range and surprises that You Tube will always provide me with, it leaves me spoilt for choice and as very loyal, consistent, interested, active, and appreciative You Tube subscriber I really cant say that they have ever not provided something I havent not enjoyed. I just wish from the time of its inception and when all those many years ago I would discover and see these videos that were on exciting and on another level and something you would have never recorded on VHS at mum and dads or found on a DVD and would love a physical tube of some sort with the inscribed and perhaps photographically snapshot of my history from go to whoah. Like a time capsule of snapshots, as it pretty much would define You in a Tube. Something left for the world to see or something you want to keep hidden or buried. Thanks You Tube you are and vice I turn to for many reason in many ways and that is satisfaction and I just wish I could keep up a paid membership. But COVID times call for priorities and sacrifices we never thought wed face. But Themms The BrakkesWhich is what I am now going to search and see what I get"

"Unsavoury. Its not a bad app, but it has bugs. and you cant do much without being spammed with ads to join youtube+ or youtube kidsits also very unsavoury, doing whatever they can to maximize their profit, not caring at all for the damage it may have on its content creators and customers.This company is a shady company that only cares about money and taking your data for that money. choice is yours"
"Privacy options are a bit odd. The app has generally worked OK for me, but I really do not understand why the it requires full access to all photos, microphone, and camera in order to upload an already shot video. That seems a bit sketchy and makes little sense to me.I would probably give it four stars if not for this sketchy behavior around privacy"
UNETHICAL SCAM ARTISTS. Multiple times I have seen YouTube delete views from BTS music videos...they seem to be run by criminals and con artists with no morals. They deny manipulating data but we see it happen live. Trash
Your advertising has ruined your platform. We all know we are going to see advertisements. And we know you collect data on us to create an algorithm of what would interest us. So when you display multiple ads of things that I vehemently oppose I now understand that you dont care about your viewers and only how much money you can make from advertising. Way to sell your soul
Big privacy concerns. I am 100% sure the app is selling my view to other shops and partners online

"Too many gambling Adverts. I am a recovering gambler and after 10 years without messing up, your Adsense engine bombards me with constant adverts from gambling companies. You are failing to safeguard me from harm.YouTube earns so much money from selling my data, to gambling companies"
Ads to watch ads. Ads for 30 second videos. Multi BILLION DOLLAR company just slamming useless ads in my face. Not once have I ever bought a product from a website harvesting my data to entice me with product it thinks I need. I have to watch an ad after I watch an ad. I have to watch an ad for a video under 45 seconds long. Seriously. The ad is longer than the short silly video Id like to quickly watch. Wasnt this the whole premise of YouTube? To get people to binge? I have to watch an ad to continue watching a video I left off. Even after I watch a sequence of ads originally. Absolutely abysmal standards. Ill see you at the gates when judgement day comes you commies
TOO MANY ADS. One cannot watch any tube without a plethora of unwanted ads. I dont watch You Tube much anymore because of the ads.Update: 4/11/21. It would be nice if You Tube would be as forthcoming with what they want to UPDATE as Google is selling our information.Very poor thought process on the programmers part. Not all of us are stupid. I seldom watch You Tube anymore
Okay. If you dont watch YouTube youre missing out its movies music everything and easy to access easy to watch at my number one television station I think Im going to start posting my own personal videos and do stuff its just the way to go
"Money at all cost. The app forces excessively long, unrelated ads randomly interspersed in channels. All because you dont join to their excessively overcharging subscription. Flagrant abuse of privacy too"
"YouTube used to be great. To be honest YouTube used to be great, but now its so full of adverts the minute you turn the app on its adverts. If it was a 5 second advert it wouldnt be too bad but the 30 second adverts. Watching these adverts used up my data its not fair and not right"
"Hackerville4Real. This is a opportunity for anyone that is trying to stalk someone with everything to do with your likes abs dislikes in music not only that but in your lifeNever less there are different You Tube apps so I advise everyone to look before picking the one I made a mistake in choosing On the other note  will really be surprised how much of your life and photos are spread among the social life world If any one has the same events happening to them please email me I will direct you what I was told to do I think Google overall has been awesome and even though they cater to the android user more then the iOS user I still use them, but they can only provide and assist with what is the matter at the time. But Im just letting everyone know that this is but indeed not something I signed up for my Personal Life Life style and identity spread all over apps third party Apps as if theyre there for an audience to embarrass me or use to blackmail my credentials and morals Its not fair and its breaking the Human protection Rights Laws, especially without the consent or approval of I myself Thank you community for reading this.

"No privacy. Incessant ads and sketchy terms of service led me to this review. Great content, terrible experience. they always be asking me if I want to upgrade to premium.  I DO NOT WANT TO UPGRADE"
Addicted. All time favorite app. 90% of my data goes to YouTube 
1/2 star scammmmm. just a scam don\'t sign in to this app. Google owned and inmediately you will be sign to every google app owned by them....Security is not their priority... just a scam to pump their user numbers to sell ads....SCAM
Why you should give YouTube a 5 star rating. Because you can do anything on her and watch stuff like private stuff
The best view of all. YouTube is just brilliant for content and always can provide a range of views on most topics which add insight and knowledge to the viewer. The quality of most contributors has increased year on year and now could be said to be the first stop for those seeking information and easy tutorials to enable a greater understanding of a wide range of tech in the real world. Love the current layout and Q/A conversational data. All round this is clearly the best channel to get a range of perspectives on many topics
Privacy setting not working. The video upload in private and I change to public and it gives me an error and now all my new videos are private none can see them please help me. Please fix my account I need my videos to be public. Thank you
"Pay for features you cant use. YouTube forces iOS users to pay for premium to use Picture in Picture mode, but lo and behold, even when you go into the settings to turn it on, it still doesnt work. Forcing your users to pay to use a feature then refusing to allow access to it is one of the most scummy business practices theyve had here, let alone the fact that they hide content they dont like and also continue to keep their content creators from making money on the platform by blocking ads from playing for many of them, so they cant earn a living. Shove off, YouTube"
"To many mandatory ads on long videos. You are already making money off my viewing habits , selling my info and now you farts are asking me to buy a premium membership to remove ads and still sell my information.  Get stuffed"
"Hooked need YouTube anonymous . Loving it YouTube is my number one source of interaction, information and resources to all my needs. I find it very useful. As in the middle of this pandemic, YouTube has been my companion and my social way to interact. I use it for personal growth, keep up with the news, ongoing issues with current events. Worship and spiritual growth. Gossips as well. Love it Thank you guys for your support to the community service. God bless. "
"Advert loading. The app itself isnt bad, the incredible amount of adverts on YouTube are. Its a self-deprecating circle round the drain when YouTube is so ad-heavy it strangles its creators ad revenue because people use ad-blockers, then the creators turn to sponsored videos and end up getting lambasted by their followers"
"Reason I give it one star. I have removed the app off my phone because of ads.. i will watch on my pc with ad block active..  The reason Ive given YouTube one star its because Im fed up of all the ads in the videos ads violate our consumer rights when it comes out of our mobile data as youre paying for mobile data and its using it without your consent and for videos you do not want to see, PS I will be looking for a solicitor to challenge this on our consumer rights"
Bad. When I upload a video the privacy settings change to private even tho its on public I know yall did that and I know yall are too lazy to get yo butts up and do you something is if you dont fix it youll be getting an e-mail from me
"just wanna enjoy the content creators . ... love the app... i pay for Premium*** warning *** since last three weeks, and this update, the unsolicited ads, so-called featured, forced content and unwanted junk has exploded in app.everytime the app is opened, there are now another hundred unwanted sugestions... of content i do not wish to see.  ...on topics ive read, spoken (in proximity of microphone), or viewed on my browser; the content limit controls no longer do anything; and google is grossly crossing line with linking data history scraped across OS apps which i do not want.where is GDPR ? ...for premium subscription fees, i expect capability to stop any and all forced content i have not selected; especially yer fekn politcal ads and sales gimmicslisten to our voices; but stop eaves-dropping"
"Shame To see 4k isnt still here. The app just dont allow 4k streaming. Its pathetic to see how google tries to limit these features in apple. You can do better than this. I have been your customer, allowing you to use my data for advertisements. Why cant you just deliver 4k streaming on iphone and apple TV 4K is just beyond my understanding. Hope youll see all of your users equal independent of the OS platform they use and try to make apps work little better. Once, these features are included Ill revise my rating.Is it because of the Vp9 codec that you use??"
Poor privacy practices. If you want to upload an existing video you have to give access to camera and mic? Nice try Google
"Great example of developers sitting on their butts doing nothing. Hey Google, how about you fire the lead developer and get someone in there that can dk the job? The app keeps freezing, specially after posting a commend. Sometimes I am going to post a comment and cancel it and it freezes as well. Come on, don&#39;5 you people already make a killing from the incredible number of ads and gathering and sales of our personal information? Put some money you make off of us to good use and FIX THE LOUSY APP -The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing A LOT when trying to post a comment. Specially on longer commands. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of ads you are forcing people to watch and the incredible amount of money you are making from the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t put together a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. SERIOUSLY How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
Privacy?. Good luck with that.  Google wants every bit of information about you to resell to the highest bidder
"More ads then late night tv. Im all for content creators getting paid, but the amount of ads is making this unbearable to use. I just watched a 120 minute video that had about 15 ads, thats insane. Also, dont forget to use this signed out so google cant data mine you"
"Stop. Recording. Me. Running the latest versions of iOS and YouTube as of this day. I was browsing the YouTube all minding my business. Upon switching to the home screen I noticed the little red microphone icon at the top of the screen. I opened YouTube again, went to the home screen and repeated this several times. YouTube was audio recording me without my permission and without alerting me that I was being recorded. This is a blatant violation of my privacy and why I dont like Google products"
"YouTube ads suck. YouTube ads are a waste of my Data, please remove all ads immediately?"
Privacy Problems. This app access lot of personal in a weird way 
Why do I have to give you private information to watch my selected videos?. I selected numerous videos from your preview list but I cant watch any unless I divulge private information  Is this a con or what?
"I cant go back. Now if I visit A, and there are B, C, D. If I visit C, there are bunch of other videos, and I cant watch B, or, I cant go backThere may be a way like saving B to a watch list, but I have to sign in. This is not convenient:1. I MUST remember the User ID and the password This is VERY inconvenient2. There are 100s of IDs and passwords. I have to save them in a file.That means I have to retrieve them with my laptop, then signing in YouTube.3. I would suggest that you will not ASK to sign in.If a person wants to sign in, he/she would do that alreadyI am on my iPhone right now.4. Nowadays theres no privacy online: Every ad agency will intrude into your PC/laptop in order to get the victims preferences. So the passwords are prone to stealing (I have been one. I end up having passwords on all documents (on whatever I can).You have pledged to uphold your customers privacy; prove it"
Like YouTube but they have messed up my act. I am a fan of YouTube it helps me with read along books listening to my music or even finding a decent doc. My only complaint is that I was hacked and reported this to YouTube I have been trying close to a year to get my acct back. I explained to them I was hacked and I never tried uploading anything explicit to YouTube . My google info was hacked its been fixed but YouTube still refuses to give me back my YouTube
"Completely dysfunctional. All I get is ads, more ads &amp; even more adverts. An app should be useable for the purposes for which it is intended. In this case viewing you tube videos, not adverts. This app is solely designed to autoplay adverts and steal your personal data so that more adverts can be forced upon you. I have deleted it"
TOO MANY ADS. also data-mining polls. youre much better off installing an adblocker and using YouTube on a PC
"This is way better than TikTok and Anyone who has an IQ above 0 can agree. YouTube is great. Everyone (who has a fully functioning brain) uses this because you have access to videos of whatever you practically search for; wholesome videos, gaming videos, animation videos, meme videos, music videos, etc. You can make videos of any duration or live stream moments in favorite hobbies or pastimes. There are a few flaws about YouTube that arent really a big deal to say the least.....then theres TikTok. TikTok is just horrible, and anyone who has learned to speak in the actual human language knows about this. For one, Tiktok videos dont kill as much time as they should, as in, their videos can only be as long as one minute, and that is just the smallest reason. Also TikTok has been accused of stealing peoples personal data. And one last thing about TikTok is that I have a feeling that it was actually created so China can make stereotypes about the United States and use that in Media or Propaganda against us"
Garbage just to make a quick buck. App creates terrible info bubble - causing less people talking based on shared accurate facts. App is contributing to destroying society as a whole - just to sell ads. Everyone that works there should be ashamed. Would give it negative stars but cant
YouTube. I will not use this app. It wants to know who my contacts are. Who my contacts are is none of your business. My friends like their privacy and I will NOT allow any app to find out about my friends. That is a dealbreaker
"What does mini player have to do with protecting kids privacy. This part of the childrens protection act thing on YouTube is literally the dumbest thing Ive ever seen with YT. What does not allowing mini player on, lets say, a Barbie song have to do with anything? Please respond and dont be rude to ignore this like you do everything else"
Not really good. No privacy
"Would give 5 stars but. Two things.One: YouTube doesnt let you watch in 1440, 2770 or 4K on the iPad latest generation I can watch 4K on my device when I film it myself, but why not on YouTube?Two: YouTube tracks your watch history and shows you other relevant videos, but because of that it gives you extra advertisements on the videos it knows you watch, like or would like"
"Bare Minimum. Works fine to play videos, but thats about it. YouTube has consistently refused to implement support for new OS features. Unfortunately they have no incentive to do so either. I HATE Google and their privacy practices"
"Refused to explain. I an an OAP who enjoys watching wildlife on YouTube. I have never, nor know how to upload anything. I only watch the recommended viewings yet I have had my account with my playlist blocked. Despite asking why no one has ever given me a reason"
"One star until they fix ad personalisations. Despite my linked Google account having personalisation switched on, the app is plagued with irrelevant advertising. Frankly, some of the ads are downright disgusting conspiracy theories and put me off using the app at all. There is clearly some gap between account services and the app picking up on my ad data, but this needs fixing soon as its seriously enough to make me want to delete the app entirely"
Trash no longer any good ads ads ads. Effing ridiculous unusable un enjoyable ruined wiyh adverts 1 video equals 4 ads ...disgusting greed ...Lets be honest you update every other day..why? To steal our data and keep yourself in jobs
The MadMarker. I remember the good ol days when apps didnt spy on your conversations in order to show you ads that you are more likely to click on. What I dont understand is why people would open a video watching app to do some online shopping. And now FB ads on YT? Where is this crazy world going?
"My videos are going private help. So my videos are going private when I set them as public. Is that a bug or just mine? And if someone could, could you tell me how to set my videos for kids? I post gacha and nothing inapropriate. Could someone help? Thank you"
Not YouTube anymore. More ads than videos. Just a glorified data mine
What would possess you to do this?. Normally i can deal with the weird updates but this time took it too far. Ads take me to the app store and it covers the skip ad button. Super annoying because all the apps advertised on youtube are 100% data mining if you do install them. Revert back to ads NOT taking me to the app store or im cracking my iphone to get ad free youtube
Great place to get info. I do get most of my news from YouTube and I control what I watch. Thanks
"Extreme Information Overload. Sell the ads, promote the products"
"Much buffering now but better than the website. Much of the content I chose either needs high resolution or only 144p, which the app offers but YouTubes website doesnt (240p is its lowest).What would be nice to see one day is dynamic video resolution which maintains good detail on readable content during static periods and blurs motion to save bandwidth. Its a necessary pain to enable automatic resolution only for it to be slower with fallback which prefers automatically increased demands over seamless real-time continuity. I guess they decided to table the usability issue in favor of Closed Captions so my being an avid user of those, and considering the other problems with diminished user priority which denies access to functionality during playback, notably scrub control of ads and cessation of playback(ad-supported version) whenever iOS display/audio controls are accessed, I havent any rights to ask for perfection without expecting much longer ads. And nobody wants THAT"
YouTube pissing me off. Its really pissing me off having to put my personal information in to watch a video when Im older than 18
Ads. Data mining your users wasnt enough eh? I will literally stop using your product before I pay for your ad free subscription service. Never forget that you can be replaced 
"News and Media. YouTube has been deleting videos showing the new data about COVID-19 and videos of physicians showing the reality of the virus and the US governments over blown policies based off the new data. YouTube also forces popular Youtubers, when doing a charity livestream, to donate to the WHO even though the organization is being investigated for Crimes Against Humanity by multiple national leaders, as well as the US government"
"Dont Download. Dont download this app cause YouTube is not like it use to be They still your information and sell it and they will let others say what they want to but want let you do the same thing, Im telling they will delete your page they deleted 3 of my pages I was going to use this app to promote my new Business but Im not now"
"Background data eats battery life. Even though I close the app, and clear my windows YouTube still manages to take up my phones battery life. Another thing they need to fix the bugs; some videos keep blacking out when loading or during a video. Also theres a feature I really dislike is when you turn the screen side ways, you can see the comment section; truthfully I really dont care for this, and want to watch a full screen video. Its annoying to have to get rid of it every time I watch a video"
"This is a wanton trampling on user privacy. You must allow YouTube to scan the local network to play the video, otherwise it will stop on the playback page and cannot play. This is a wanton trampling on user privacy"
Seeing ads despite paying for premium. Make your privacy nutrition label and release some updates google. You cant hide your foul play forever :) not that Apple is any less guilty than you are
Total garbage product. Invades youre privacy
"Ads and Commercials. For some reason, ads recently became super long, there is a minimum of two, and have nothing to do with anything I like. They are super annoying, sometimes obscene and distracted me to the point that I no longer care about watching videos anymore. When I cast to my smart TV, there is no way to skip the ads or commercials and you end up paying for 8 times as much in data to watch one stupid video. Marketing jerks"
I wish Spotify dominates you soon. Yall become more hustling everyday and no privacy at all
"Awful. You cant get rid of ads you dont agree with, refuses to acknowledge Your Google ad preferences"
Tracking?. What sort of tracking device is YouTube and how did we give it absolute permission to track the type of Rice we purchase with our debit cards and in turn see advertisements for said Rice? At this point these companies need to be held accountable for tracking every move we make or send us a check for collecting our info at least
Deleted. Too much data being handed over. Removed the app after seeing the privacy labels. Way too much data needed to be exchanged for me to watch a video online. Not worth it. Use the browser instead
Ads are a big disappointment. This is to YouTube If u want to make lend my data to ppl who r interested. On an average for every 2.5 minutes u make me watch the same ads twice its irritating may switch to something else soon big disappointment from YouTube
Security Risk. Stealing data to use for personal profit (and Im not referring to income)
"Results of a monopoly. YouTube doesnt have to try anymore. Its a waste of time to try to improve their product for the consumer, they arent going to gain anything near a significant amount of new users. So all that leaves is improvements for advertisers, getting better at selling our data. Which is fine, thats the only way YouTube can be profitable, but their product keeps getting worse. Let me be clear, Im not whining about changes or new features, but theyre taking away features, the Unwatched category to refine suggestions no longer appears for me. Video upload dates are no longer available. Ive noticed the red bar to show if youve watched or began watching a video does not appear consistently anymore. I have so many problems with YouTube, but the idea of a significant competitor at this point is laughable, so for now Im stuck with you.. tube"
"Too addicting. Censored content, too addicting, and no privacy - toggles not to track are placebos"
Far too buggy. Way too buggy. Also lets just give all your data to Google
"It works but.  YouTube has been censoring a lot of the political content I want to watch. Not cool. Im an adult, I can make my own decisions about what to watch. Also Adblockers dont work on the app. Annoying since I refuse to subscribe to paid you tube as long as they keep censoring people"
Bad privacy. I was able before to decide to remove inappropriate ads... now this option doesnt exist ... they say because the personalization is not ON .... I checked my settings and it was ON.... I sent couple of feedbacks but still the same issue... if you are a parent or dont like to see inappropriate ads dont install it.... Actually removing inappropriate ads should be our right whatever is our settings.... I had to uninstall it
"one star. because I couldn&#39;t give it zero stars. how dare they force us to do surveys without paying us for that data and make them unskippable. And the ads have become very invasive it&#39;s worse that television for some videos The creators don&#39;t get paid enough and videos have become next to impossible to monetize. This website is evil and I can&#39;t wait for something better for creators and their audience to come along. rip Youtube,I have what you&#39;ve turned into"
"Comment section. I personally enjoy the comments being at the top. Usually when Im watching a video I jump to the comment section. I feel its a habit when Im looking at a review or a tutorial. Stuff like that. I do find it annoying when Im looking at music , clips where I dont need to look at the comment section as fast. Learn to adapt people. Censorship is good in a way. Gets people to act more civil and respect each other. Something society is losing. Maybe instead of watching irrelevant stuff , you can watch something relevant. I do hate your privacy terms and I stand by that"
"inappropriate ads, let me report them. LET ME REPORT ADSADS HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE SOMETIMESJUST BECAUSE I AM OLD ENOUGH DOESN&#39;T MEAN I SHOULD HAVE TO SEE THEMi shouldn&#39;t have to change my preferences to get rid of them, i don&#39;t want there to be data collected on meill be a bit more specific in saying that what was being advertised was fine, but the images they used were sexual and this was an ad placed under the video not before itthis is annoying, just let me press the button to say hey &#34;they shouldn&#39;t be showing this in this way&#34;"
YouTube automagically updated the app for me. YouTube force updated the app adding this crap feature like many mentioned that hide the comments and replace it with recommendations for videos. The update is still sitting there on the App Store and find this a huge invasion of privacy with YouTube and Apple not cool
"From Super App to Utter Crap. This app used to be very good but has progressively declined over the years. When I first downloaded the app it was an almost identical user experience to desktop website. Now however the suggestions in no way resemble my interests, instead showing sponsored material, films with an additional cost, adverts, and generic other crap I have little to no interest in. In addition to this, the app is constantly trying to force the paid YouTube app on me, flashing pop ups on me on a regular basis which I have to constantly decline. Get the hint Im not interested in paying for your app. Finally, I understand that income has to form part a significant part of the YouTube business model, and of the sources of income advertising probably forms a substantial figure. But its reached a point where you must overcome or negotiate your way around numerous adverts before, during, and after every video. This, like most other social media apps, has drifted away from the ambition to be user friendly, into a saturate of profitable deluge washing the user firmly into the rear end of the apps purpose so that they can instead focus on brainwashing us with adverts and selling every obtainable scrap of data they can get on the user to third parties"
Bots. Lately theres been a TON bot accounts doing a a lot of spam that is trying to hack into YouTube HQ and other people accounts.also theses bot accounts hack other peoples channel and if a someone subscribes to a bots channel they hack it to get the user that sub to them to get their personal information so if you gonna be lazy while the virus thing is happening  well be lazy and let your fans get hack. I will give this a better star rating after yall  fix this bot problem but for now Im giving yall one star
You should really get youtube but if you do then be carful. Ok so if you are  reading this I just want to say you should be carful because there are some very scary videos out on YouTube but lots of the videos are very calming and good for kids or teenagers.  Some of the frighting videos are  real so if you find something that is to scary for you should get out of the video right away.  But YouTube can be a very good for your entertainment. And if you comment dont give any personal info to anybody.All that I saying is really just common sense. So I hope you enjoy the app
"Infested with advertisements, disgusting. I clicked on the video 30 times and it gave me to same add. I closed it, clicked the video, same add. Pathetic. I dont use the app often enough to pay for subscription so when I try and look up a video or song theres a 50/50 chance Im going to get an add. And the add isnt some short little 30 second add, these things can drag on for 5 minutes. Doesnt matter if I close the add, my data was already charged the 5 minute add. 5 minute add for a 3 minute song I wasnt even able to listen to.  This is their way of making you pay for subscription or theyll fk up your phone bill. Its all about money and Im never paying a cent.I have unlimited data so I dont care about adds, I hardly use the app. But when I do Im absolutely buried in advertisements.I do feel sorry for the people who cant afford unlimited internet usually meaning they cant afford subscriptions either, so YouTube is off limits if youre not willing to bend over for themIts sick. Raping my data for every penny"
"Watching ads is the whole point. Whatever you do, whatever way you setup, configure and connect, the point of this app is to track your phone, behavior, and habits to sell and serve you ads.Everything else comes second"
"Not a fan of interface & Ads are too much. I dont like the interface, I dont particularly find it to be user friendly. The ads have also gotten out of hand. I dont enjoy going to YouTube anymore, its a chore when it used to be fun. They already make money tracking you and collecting data on you, so I dont see the reason to shove more ads down our throats except you know greed. I wish there was a good alternative"
"Informative and fun. While this platform is not for everyone involved in todays controversial discussions, it does offer information to a wide variety of people with no prejudice in regards to age. There still remains quite a bit of valuable information if the subscriber knows where to look. While our world faces increasing injustice in government and health for the planet and mankind are declining, platforms are challenging truth and justice as well as privacy. You tube still offers truth seekers the availability of searching for those willing to stand up and speak truth . You can still search and obtain information labeled conspiracy by other platforms or news sources. There are limitations.YOUTUBE CRAFTERS are definitely in abundance and offer many ideas, challenging  creativity . Tutorials are available on a variety of subjects...cooking , drawing, sewing, building, music etc... limited by Your imagination  Inspiration is still here for those who want it . Navigation can be done even by a child . Enjoy"
"Privacy. Alongside all the other problems, theres also privacy issues. It tracks my location even though I opted out"
"Makes bad business decisions. People wanted less ads, we got more, and if you want no ads, have fun paying tons per month. Picture in picture is only available to Premium users, which slightly makes sense, but I don't really understand it. Do they need more money, they already sell your info"
Sell your personal info. Hey app developer you wanna explain why yall sell my info and charge me for $12.99 a month?? Take a page out of HBOs play book and give us the option to not let you sell our personal info
"What would you do without YouTube. What an incredible source of information, knowing that one can reference most any subject & find a solution to a problem.Its like Elon says, you dont need a college education for learning anymore"
"Youtube. Youtube is a good way to find new info, watch your favourite content creators and watch with friends or family. You can also share videos to other people# UwU"
Greedy. Thank you once again for forcing us to subscribe to premium content if we want to store videos offline at a great price. App is a great for using up data by playing 2ads before you get to the actual content. YouTube more like adtube
"Playbook Youtube is better, perpetual daily updates. Can&#39;t minimize and continue playing, interface is cryptic, gui is overly simplistic, how to play previous video?   The Youtube app for Blackberry Playbook (from 2008?) is superior to this junk. Whats with the daily app updates? YouTube is trying to steal user data and information?"
"Age Verification - Orwellian. The new age/ID verification on any video which MAY contain sensitive content is an atrocious policy. It requires either a photo ID or credit card upload. I need to hand over personal information to big tech like I need a hole in the head. Who knows how theyll use it or sell it to. Watching the wrong videos? We know who you are and where you live. .....Yeah sounds great. This is also a fantastic way to practically kill off any channels deemed inappropriate - of course what is and isn&#39;t appropriate is determined by YT. Theyve shown time and time again that they have certain biases, and this is simply another method to silence dissident voices. Abhorrent"
"Overwhelming ads, necessary evil?. Constant unavoidable advertisements. An algorithm that feeds paranoia and fear in service of higher profits. Data mining the users. An app that bugs me constantly to join an overpriced paid service that wouldnt deliver a value matched user experience. But I cant stop watching"
"Least Transparent Video App Available. The removal of dislike views has gotten YouTube into a worse situation. I can no longer tell if a video is misleading, spam, or has trash quality overall. This move seems to benefit large corporations, YouTube creators with low quality content, and corrupt politicians the most, as there is less transparency between the video data and the viewer. This review will stand as is until YouTube reinstates the dislike count"
"Alphabet CEOS are the worst. This app shows me a comercial every 3 minutes in a documentary. It tries to ruin any video or movie you watch. These people only care about making the world a negative space. Greedy buggers. I will not give google any money ever, they make enough spying and selling my private information all day. And they spy, because every time I leave the room?? The videos pause on my devices. So theyre tracking you. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCTS ADVERTISED ON GOOGLE OR YOUTUBE. I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MORE THAN WHAT YOU ALREADY TAKE WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSIDERATION"
This platform promotes scam ads. Buy YouTube premium and get no ads. Or how bout I download brave browser and get paid for my data. The aggressiveness with the ads has led me to research a ad block. Found a free alternative and it actually pays me for my data. Took 20 seconds to download. No ads and I get paid. Still I would prefer to find another platform that doesnt promote scams and try to ruin peoples lives
"Views. YouTube is not true to its view count, they delete views and FOR WHAT? There is no point when you can track the views on websites and you can physically see them delete the views. If they know groups will get a very large number of views then they should be prepared for anything"
Not so great anymore. YouTube has way too many ads nowadays. YouTube doesnt seem to work with cellular data (5G)
You tube a way of life. No one can successfully enjoy personal and or public entertainment without you tube being a part of it somehow
You tube a way of life. No one can successfully enjoy personal and or public entertainment without you tube being a part of it somehow. You tube is truly a way of living
"Something is not right. There is a hacker around the more young kids-teenager side of youtube. He has hacked someone in the gacha community, I cant exactly write the name because of the Japanese symbols (if you write MB and see some chicken police officer thingy thats what it is) but he has leaked all their personal info, used links to gather IP adresses and exposed them on the community tab. Can you PLEASE deactivate the account at the very least unless you want to endanger the lives of poor innocent kids and teens alike"
"Hold up, wait a minute. This app is awesome for watching videos, but I have a problem.There is no way to email, nor live chat with YouTube to get this problem fixed, the problem is that when I change a video to public, it says error saving video data, and will switch to private. My Chanel is LJLion1 yt, could you please fix this"
"DELETE THIS APP RIGHT NOW. THE DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ARE TOO DANGEROUS, DO YOU WANT STRANGERS TRACKING EVERY SECOND AND EVERY TAP YOU MAKE? ABSOLUTELY NOT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY WHEN YOU GET A TEXT AND THE PICTURE FROM YOUR FRIEND DOESNT SHOW? BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO TAP IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE DELETE ALL SOCIAL MEDIA APPS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"
"YouTube everywhere. Seamless moving between PC, iPad, iPhone, Smart Display, Tesla . No matter which device I use, I get strong performance and an amazing feature set. YouTube is incredible on so many levels, yet so frustrating with the ad sponsored version. The price to escape the ads is the YouTube Premium, which is disturbingly expensive, and worth every penny"
Necessary update. YouTube very buggy and affected my data service
You Tube can be so personal . We all have our own interests 
Please add this:. Please add to report video the option for personal information because some people show there personal information like where they live and there age
CONSERVATIVE BIAS. YouTube started out as a GREAT app but in the past year ya have become VERY hostile towards Conservatives Ya can deny it ALL ya want but the data proves it There will be a app before long that will put Ya out of BUSINESS and its a shame It USE TO BE A GREAT APP but now ya are NOTHING MORE BUT A DNC MOUTH PIECE
Car and comedy maintenance. YouTube data analysis makes finding bookmarks and distraction efficient
Forced update. Forced update with too many ads and autoplays videos using my data on the home menu with no option to turn them off in settings? Biggest joke
"LOOK AT THE:  DATA LINKED TO YOU. Enough said.  Dont use any app made by Google.  Their privacy policy allows them to literally record your keystrokes as you type a message into Gmail, and thats just one of the less intrusive examples.  If you dont believe me, go ahead and read their privacy policy yourself"
"What can I say?. Youtube is one of the most popular data and entertainment apps ever know in history, here are my thinkingsGood stuff:Wow this is like really good, there are comments, likes, accounts, and people could spread their good-ats on this This app can let you watch videos and show you some brand new stuff Id say this app is pretty perfect.But it used to be good:Everything is still good, except for the adds LOOK, THIS APP GIVES DOUBLE NO SKIP 15 SECOND ADDS WHATTTTTTTTT This is just unacceptable for me, im pretty impatient, and how does it make sense you need to wait 30 seconds until you can watch what you wanna watch?Overall: Pretty good I guess, keep up the good work and try to keep the ad times and the ad amounts a but shorter, a great app"
Privacy is the big issue with this app. Why I need to permit this app to have access in to my camera and microphone  to upload the blooming video? Single video is not enough to upload? Complete rubbish
Updates mean tracking and user control by google. So yeah.. every time you update the app the advertisements become more invasive and annoying
"I knew the privacy was bad, but. Good lord do they do a lot of data mining. No thanks. Thanks for the update, apple"
"Absolutely unimpressed. That I need Youtube premium to watch a video I downloaded with my own data which I bought with my hard earned money is pretty much annoying, extremely annoying. If someone wants to go premium it should totally be because they want to and not imposed. Please work on that ASAP"
Best dont change it. Best app love it its totally cool you can watch videos its not laggy and its perfect dosent need changes the best and I love watching videos with my friends and family we like jkrew and guavajuice thats our favorite channels on YouTube I dont know why some people put 1. Stars its perfectly fine there may be some inappropriate stuff in YouTube just dont watch them just watch happy stuff and cool stuff just ignore the inappropriate stuff and you can see games challenges and lots of cool stuff just that its 17+ and my little sister thats 6 watches YouTube so can you change that to something lower because thats a big number and my little sister sees Ryan toys review I dont know what it is that or spy ninjas she sees two of those YouTubes but my mom takes it off because its 17+ so can u please put it a lower number thats all you need to change
"Such a great time here. Between the most predatory data collection that makes me feel uncomfortable to even have private conversations near my phone without being advertised for the same such things said in confidence, the neo-Nazi pseudo science that your algorithm has failed to solve, and recommendations that make me wonder if you guys even use any of the data collected on me, or literally just sell Pretty much the single worse app I could use, and an app I am forced to use due to monopoly Thanks youtube Thanks for the motivation to unalive myself every day"
"Bad, bad fixes. This app update got worse than before, bombarding me with tons of commercials.Theres no privacy to anything you do"
Remove the Made for kids rule. Us content creators are being sued for making videos this is outrageous and unfair. It is not the content creators fault for collecting data
"I want to restrict mindless content from rotting my sons mind. You Tube can share data between devices and do all kinds of amazing things, but not give me the ability to restrict the low level content that my 5 year old son likes to watch...such as Johny Shows....the kinds of videos that rot the minds of little kids...all I want to do is block that content from showing up...but alas no button or path to do this...thanks for nothing You Tube"
Watch free advertisements. This app plays great advertisements tailored to your stolen profile information. If you are lucky enough you might get few glimpses of the video you actually want to play
Dont delete YouTube. You get to watch videos they are fun you learn from videos how could I not like YouTube YouTube is something that kids could watch that you can get inspired by 123 go I love that spy ninjas is the great sniper wolf Leah Ash who I want to watch them
"Lost its way. There was a time before naked yoga, and whats in my butt videos. Before Elsa and Pregnant Spider-Man. When there were no hour long infomercials sprinkled throughout a 20 minute video. When rules were enforced blindly instead of politically. I cant wait for this company to sink its own ship. Use Rumble, Odysee, or Bit Chute. Stop letting Alphabet profit from your stolen data"
YouTube. YouTube is amazing if your TV doesnt work or your Wi-Fi isnt working put on your data and you can watch YouTube on your phone and if youre an Introvert and youre going camping you can sneak YouTube on your phone 
"Rubish app. Why youtube asking confidential information? Bank card to confirm age its just a rubish app which want to get all ur data , this should be illegal And you should be taken to court for trying to collect all information from people and banned this app and who ever behind it"
Spies and spoils. Ive recently noticed YouTube seems to recommend videos based on my search history in safari. I realised this recently because for work I searched something about fire procedures in my safari browser then about a day later YouTube recommended a fire evacuation video to me. It also does this for tv shows and games I like and often spoils them with something in the title or header image. Ive paused my search data in the YouTube app but it will still recommend videos based on what I search which makes little sense. It needs a spoiler blocker
"Modern day Facebook. Constant political ads, very much sells information with other sites. YouTubes disinformation and inability to dislike ads will likely land it in front of congress"
"Reporting scams. I&#39;ve tried countless times to report channels that promote fake websites that reward you with premium currency for your favorite game. I can report the video but not the channel? Is there a reason why that&#39;s not available? These videos take advantage of children and put them at risk of releasing their personal info. Stop acting stupid youtube, if you can take down monetization for someone swearing, then you have the algorithm to weed out these video ads. Step up your game and take down those who use the platform to abuse unknowing children"
"Not showing up in location services. This app works great, but I guess this is google stealing privacy on iPhone users. They dont show up in location services, that mean that you change the location services to  only when using app. No, google want to take all you privacy away from us, just so they can make a money with our data, our private data. Its very easy to miss an app not showing up in location services with all the other apps we have on our phone. An they are banking on it that you will not notice it too. Our privacy is our right, it should be free"
stop doing the age restricting thing. maybe people dont want to show you their personal information just to watch a video
;(. YouTube was a good app before they started changing things and messed it all up it acts like it never has WiFi or data the ads are getting on my nerves and its just slow to the point I had to un download it Ill just rather pay for a better app then use YouTube
"Great. They collect and mine your data. They knowingly work in cooperation with governments to monitor and spy on your online presence. They censor thoughts and ideas :bad, good and innocuous. They have bought favor within groups that are known for racist behavior as well as other nefarious purposes. Dont use this service if you have the ability. Their privacy #TOS is peopaganda to give the illusion they have your best interest in mind. They lie goggle and all of alphabet inc subsidiaries are accelerating a future that is anti-human. The proof of all this  is the fact that this wont be posted"
"Intrusive ads. Too many ads that feel targeted, get out of my data. Ads are also too long and I still cant close my phone and continue to listen to music? Whats the point anymore?"
"Lots of bugs into my privacy. I've been hacked and they got all my personal information, is this app secure?"
Excessive ads. Ads are getting excessive on popular channels. Google scapes/sells so much search data from their engines to Nest products Gmail Android etc. I wish they would lighten up a bit
"Being strong armed for personal info. We didnt have to give our personal E mail address out to comment on a post. Now you do as you all see. What that does is with your info outThere not protected GoodThieves can lostPassword their way rite in to your accounts and be buying 9,000 $ diesel motors in Florida orSomeplace. They are good at it and many ofUs are victims. We areBeing forced to gi e out the key to get to our private info NIT GIID"
Garbage. steals and sells information.    Your contacts?  really?  cant block content  only loose category.   Cant block users or channels and you have to agree to sell your info to like or dislike videos which they do any ways.   Will interrupt a song  for and Add to sell you something.   Garbage.   You can be listening to a song you and get an add at that contradicts the song
"All facets of life. I use you tube for great entertainment.  I use it to learn how to do things. But most importantly I use it for personal growth. There are countless videos on different philosophies, mindfulness, self improvement, etc.  Everything I could want for any reason in my life is at my fingertips"
All the data on YouTube is excellent. YouTube is excellent
"Slow loading and deleting views. When I use mobile data, the videos have a hard time loading and are really bad quality, even if my connection is good. YouTube loves to delete views from mainly bts. They say we never delete views, only pause them to check if theyre bots, but there are literally screenshots showing them deleting the views by 5 million to 10 million at a time. While fans are working hard and giving up their sleep and time to try and break records, youtube is just deleting them by the millions in a minute. Its really frustrating when they lie to us. And Ive only seen this happen to bts. Ive heard no one else complain about any other YouTuber or artist. Not even other Korean acts. Id like this to be changed"
"Infested with advertisements, disgusting. I clicked on the video 30 times and it gave me to same add. I closed it, clicked the video, same add. Pathetic. I dont use the app often enough to pay for subscription so when I try and look up a video or song theres a 50/50 chance Im going to get an add. And the add isnt some short little 30 second add, these things can drag on for 5 minutes. Doesnt matter if I close the add, my data was already charged the 5 minute add. 5 minute add for a 3 minute song I wasnt even able to listen to.  This is their way of making you pay for subscription or theyll fk up your phone bill. Its all about money and Im never paying a cent.I have unlimited data so I dont care about adds, I hardly use the app. But when I do Im absolutely buried in advertisements.I do feel sorry for the people who cant afford unlimited internet usually meaning they cant afford subscriptions either, so YouTube is off limits if youre not willing to bend over for them"
"Ad tracking algorithm needs work. Dear YouTube/Google,Hey, I dont mind that you have a bajillion ads because humanity will always have an insatiable desire for money, but can you at least get my preferences right? I am very left wing and seeing Trumps face on my app every time infuriates and pains me to no end. The only temporary solution I have found to this problem is to uninstall and reinstall the app. Then, for a short window of 2 days, the YouTube ads directed at me will actually match the ads directed to me from my computer/desktop, etc. Please advise. This should be basic data tracking/algorithms at work. Goodbye"
"Lack of integrity/ censorship. You are censoring crucial information and allowing Only one side of political influence and information to be heard. Without the truth people cant make prudent decisions. You have usurped the Time, intellect, and energy granted from God to others and use for yourselves while failing or otherwise refusing to recognize the sources and methods from what you got the currency to be able to open and play on this platform. Then you have taking away freedom of speech and freedom of information. Your lack of integrity disgusts me and will result in the enslavement of humanity and the cannibalization of their children. And you know it"
"YouTube A unique life changing ideas TOOL globally. First time I came across YouTube to get my cheat sheet to solve a business problem when YouTube had just started, I was blown away having been given ease by watching and learning from other generous people who shared their experiences and know how which saved me lots of time, money, and headaches. Ever since then I have STOPPED watching TV and have set aside carefully selected (planned) time to learn by watching postings of MY NEED AND INTEREST which I can use for personal, business and spiritual growth (clarity).  Off course one has to be careful in sorting out truth and validity and not just go along. That applies to our daily interaction with people, books, and media in our norms.   Among many dividends of investing time with YouTube learnings, I am particularly thankful and indebted forever from the generosity of PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GURUS like Earl Nightingale, Bob Proctor, Zig Ziegler, Dr Dennis Whatley, John Maxwell, Jim Rhon, Og Mandingo, and others whose personal  and business (entrepreneurial) wisdom helped me two very successful businesses in Houston in 1983. I sold one of those in 2006 at handsome value and now at age 70, (2020) living life of significance (humbly), by engaging myself in volunteerism, mentoring, traveling overseas to promote toastmaster style arrangement among youth (besides encouraging Book-Education), playing Tennis, writing, and simply living life in indescribable happiness and peace.  ALL THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ME without the FREE Tools by YouTube..  Me, a child born into uneducated couple from a small village of an eastern country with population of 225 (or less)...GOD IS GREAT. And thank You YouTube"
Video resolutions. Stop stealing customers data if I want a low Video resolution I should be able to set it one time for low resolution not have to set it for each video
"IF YOU DONT PAY, you CANT WATCH. The most awful thing that YouTube has done is implementing data trapping, if you do not pay while YouTube is in high demand, they will actually stop you from watching videos, I can watch videos just fine in Netflix and funimation. So its only YouTube, I went and paid for the membership and suddenly every works fine"
"YouTube forgot it is in America. I like YouTube, but they have gone too far in censoring video that gives information to people so they can make up their own mind about civic issues. There is both a left and a right; both sides have the right to their opinions and supporting data to be heard. This is America. The platform should not have the right to decide who does and does not belong on the platform.Free-speech is a constitutional right"
"Annoying. I swear if Google is going to use personal info or monitor mics to recommend videos can they at least use context or make it relevant. Earlier today I was telling a friend that I dont like a specific show, I have never googled or even typed the name of the show in question. But a few hours later my entire recommend timeline is just clips and videos about the show. Its creepy enough as it is but if the logic is to recommend stuff based on conversations maybe listen for keywords like I do not like this topic this happens frequently with several things but this time was especially fast and there was so much"
No. YouTubes owners work close with the Chinese dictatorship to censor information to people. The CCP is a hostile government with numerous crimes against human rights and also works with the PLA to obtain data. Remember Tiananmen Massacre
"Every single time I upload a video it is set to private. Every single time I upload a video it is set to private even though it is set to Public when you are making your new video. I know how to set it back to public.1. Press Share, set it to unlisted 2. Press Public and then there is no error saving video Data shown"
"Same junk, different day. 12/30/2020: Yup, it keeps freezing. Have been using it for about an hour, and in that time it has frozen three times. Apple really needs to allow other apps that play YouTube videos in the App Store. By allowing YouTube to push every other app competitor out of the way, it has allowed YouTube to be complaisant, more like down right lazy. Simply because they know there is no completion and people can&#39;t go to other apps. But Apple has a lot of power over Youtube. Apple can decide to block YouTube. That would mean millions of users around the world not being able to use YouTube. I am sure that would hurt YouTube&#39;s pocket. Come on Apple, it is time to stand up for the people who have been loyal to you and bought your products, and not let YouTube bully you around. If YouTube wants to be the only app developer for their platform, the  they need to step up to the plate and play ball. Not just sit on their rear ends. I am saving this to paste it again and again, because I am sure this review will magically disappear. 12/14/2020: I&#39;ve been using this junk for about 3 hours now, in those three hours of watching videos and commenting, I&#39;ve had to close and restart the app 11 times. 10 times after posting comments and once just looking at the suggestions after a watched a video. Yup, this up in amazing....ly bad More like junk  12/12/20: Some old problem of the app freezing. Specially if I stop watching a video, start a typing a commend, and then go to another app and come back to finish my commend. Sometimes I don&#39;t even have to leave, I start typing, change my mind, and then try to exit the commend box, it gets stuck in there. I was told at Apple that there is nothing wrong with my iPad Pro. May be it&#39;s an older model iPad Pro and YouTube trying to focus on news devices with faster ships and more memory. Too bad because at Apple I was told that people don&#39;t upgrade tablets as often as they do their phones. None the less, this app is lousy and the direct result of the lack of competition as YT forced Apple to pretty much band other developer&#39;s YT apps. Before there used to be a lot of apps for iPhones and iPads. Now we are stuck with a junk app that can&#39;t perform. I wish there were more options. Well there is, a couple of my friends have gone entirely off from YT, they even closed their account. Nice . 11/26/2020: It has been a few month since this got got really bad. It has been bad for a couple of years, but now it nothing but trash. I want to start keeping a record of dates. Just to see if Google decides to fix the problem. So as of today, no change to the app or Developers just sitting on their rear ends.-Installed the latest update, and still freezes. ---Hey Google, how about you fire the lead developer and get someone in there that can dk the job? The app keeps freezing, specially after posting a commend. Sometimes I am going to post a comment and cancel it and it freezes as well. Come on, don&#39;5 you people already make a killing from the incredible number of ads and gathering and sales of our personal information? Put some money you make off of us to good use and FIX THE LOUSY APP -The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing A LOT when trying to post a comment. Specially on longer commands. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of ads you are forcing people to watch and the incredible amount of money you are making from the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t put together a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. SERIOUSLY How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
"Wont let me un-private. I try to change my video into Public but it kept saying Error Video data save when my wi-fi is great? I dont understand why its not working for me to upload my video, but please respond to let me know what I can do to fix my problem about the upload"
YouTube. YouTube is the best gives  me all the info I need and I can watch my favourite YouTube channels
Quality is annoying. Buffering is worse than it has ever been. And Data saver rarely changes the quality below 720p. Thats all well and good until it simply will not load and having it randomly change my quality is frustrating to say the least. Im really not happy with the YouTube premium question. It is misleading and predatory
"Classic Google. You don&#39;t need to access my microphone in order to upload a premade video file to you. I mean, you do, because you hard-coded your app to require all or nothing... but there is zero reason for that other than spying and harvesting our data as your company is infamous for"
Best and smart way to share information. It is nice tool for many people use in all fields
"FUN. You tube is really fun entertaining,etc but the one thing it lacks is how you have to use a google account to subscribe like and turn or notifications so yeah and how you can only access you tube shorts through phones thanks for your time , Aubrey"
"Bias Media. I really enjoy watching YouTube, however they have a terrible track record of censoring conservatives that they dont agree with"
"MY GO TO APP. I do not think all people can lie about the same:  personal; place; event; action; do it yourself;  how too;  whatever or thing at the same time.     Therefore, since various people, world wide, have the opportunity to send their input in on all of the above at anytime, you the searcher, more than likely will find the TRUTH on any of the above at anytime and have a wider perspective.     My comments are related to the GOOD, that humans do in life.  Yes, I know there are other type verifying apps but they are not ALL as they project.     Lastly, TOP FREE ENTERTAINMENT  THE BEST"
I cant make my video public. So I made this video and it wasnt letting me make it public there was no reason for it to be private it keeps saying theres a error saving video data can you pls help
"UP YOURS. Youre FORCING me to update to watch videos? NOT bloody likely I dumped your BS app today. People- STOP DRINKING THE KOOLAID DONT get a Google or Gmail account, DONT use the YouTube app. Theyre tracking your usage and controlling your feed"
"YouTube App Review for Adolescents- MSW Student. Overall, I rated the YouTube app a 3 in regard to adolescent usage. It allows for adolescents to use its content but does not have the capacity to avoid sharing content that may not be age appropriate. It does have tabs to help restrict inappropriate content and the ability to opt out of some data sharing, but there is still much room for adolescents to run into content that their developing brains are not fully equipped/matured to consume. On a positive note, it does include a lot of informational content if that is what an adolescent is seeking. As an adult who has more discernment on what I want to see and the consent I want to share and or not share, I enjoy the app. Parental guidance for usage of the YouTube app is highly recommended"
Great to use. I use it almost exclusively for information and general  news.Also to see new updates on products
Lies. Lets be honest your app works fine but you update every other day..why? To steal our data and keep yourself in jobs
"Less Transparent Than Ever. The removal of dislike views has gotten YouTube into a worse situation. I can no longer tell if a video is misleading, spam, or has trash quality overall. This move seems to benefit large corporations, YouTube creators with low quality content, and corrupt politicians the most, as there is less transparency between the video data and the viewer. This review will stand as is until YouTube reinstates the dislike count"

"Almost Perfect (But Not Quite). Im a very avid user of YouTube. The time that I spend using this app is so extensive it has complete replaced television for me, takes precedence over other media apps like Netflix or Hulu, &amp; is my most used app each week according to screen time. Because I spend so much time on the app I must be very pleased with my user experience &amp; I am for the most part; especially with addition of being able to stream in 4K quality (finally). However there are just two features (maybe three) that I feel like this app needs to really make it perfect for me. The first feature is a simple one but one I find myself checking to see if it got added every single week: System Matched Light &amp; Dark Mode. I know this feature might not be a deal breaker for most people but as someone who works very heavily on their phone being able to set their iPhone to shift between Light &amp; Dark Mode during sunrise or sunset has really helps me maintain my circadian rhythm, especially while working at home during this pandemic. Its a feature that already exists in YouTube TV, and a Light &amp; Dark Mode already exist in the main YouTube application, so I believe the addition of this feature would make take this app from 3 stars to 4 stars for me. The second feature I assume is coming soon given some rumors of testing happening for select users of the app, but that feature is PiP (Picture in Picture). Now I pay for YouTube Premium for two reasons. The lesser of the two is no ads while dewing videos, while the more important one to me is being able to listen to YouTube videos in the background while not in the app. I dont expect YouTube to make this PiP feature completely free given background listening is a perk reserved for YouTube Premium, but being able to swipe over whatever video Im watching for a quick peek while multitasking instead of having to shift back into the app would incredible. Its a feature that is so useful &amp; valuable for someone as such a heavy YouTube user that YouTube would be spitting in the face of their Premium subscribers if they didnt add support for the feature. Adding this feature along with the last one would jump my rating of the app from 4 to 5 stars. And thats all itll take for the YouTube app to be absolutely perfect to me. If I really wanted to add one more thing that I think the app should add if Im being really reaching is iOS 14 support for widgets. I think an interactive widget that allows me to see some recommend videos or subscriptions, or notifications of certain stories or upload of people I have post notifications turned on for would be incredible. This to me is mot a necessary feature in the slightest. This is purely icing on the cake if they were to add it. But again to wrap things up; if YouTube were to add those two features (System Matched Light &amp; Dark Mode and PiP) then I believe YouTube on iOS would be one of the ONLY apps I think is perfect in every way. I would kill to see these features implemented very soon"
"Multimedia and cybersecurity privacy technology can be more integrated. Multimedia is more regionalized, integrated into better virtual network platforms, and security management is better"
Plz stop spying. Id enjoy this app so much more if I didnt feel like I was a walking marketing tool for you. I understand it takes money to run the site but its ridiculously personal stuff that sometimes Ive only ever thought about inside my head. Like how are you even doing that anyways? I just wanna go back to 2005 so bad. Sigh
YouTube. I just love YouTube I love the documentary I love the information I learn from it I just love YouTube everyone should have the YouTube app and its absolutely free with your data plan from my network service provider
Political. If you werent so political and hide certain info for hidden agendas your popularity would be higher but hey you do you the new video streaming platform that mimics you coming out soon will show you that too
Stop  Spying  on innocent human beings. #fraudsLiars  Trolls 
GET RID OF THE KIDS UPDATE. MY VIDEOS ARE FORCED TO HAVE NO COMMENTS AND BE PRIVATE LIKE WTF
Love info. I like unbiased information more than anything. To much truth to feel the enthusiasm in the world without having to resort to false narratives. I get to choose. Thats what I love
Good enough. I enjoy the content but the commercials are WAY too frequent and off base. Its really creepy that YouTube is so insistent on listening and watching- the privacy agreement is undesirable and why I cant bring myself to pay for commercial free
Wth YouTube . Why would they not let you chose what resolution you want your video to be.  Now you have to choose between data saver mode or like high data mode where it uses more data for better resolution but personally I like the choice of choosing exactly what resolution I want the video to be. smh YouTube you lost my respect.  >:(
Sells your info trust me. Cant be trusted they sell your info
Unfair. Treats the creators that use it like garbage and rewards big corporations that steal content and spread false information
"Great recommendations for listening and viewing enjoyment. Ive had a wonderful experience using YouTube recommendations, channel subscriptions, playlists (because I can organize them as I see fit) for personal learning, curiosity, and even personal forms of therapeutic healing when Ive wanted alone time. I believe YouTube can help people of all types, in whatever capacity, in whatever environment or circumstance heal themselves in a way that can be used for good no matter what their upbringing, culture, personal ideology, or choice of understanding. Im also a fan of some other platforms but Ill keep this post generic and simple. (Yes, Im aware I overshare and tend to be long winded)"
"No Picture-In-Picture Mode. Horrible way of disabling picture-in-picture mode. Why would a billion dollar company prohibit users from using a feature with their website? Yes, Youtube has premium accounts for enabling such modes but does this mean free users data or ad revenue if irrelevant?"
"Incredible App with Major Bugs. I had used YouTube since 2015 and never had an issue with it, ever. Randomly, YouTube, and no other app has decided to enable Restricted Mode on both of my accounts (despite me having never activated them before) and now will not allow me to turn it off because my Administrator has enabled it. I do not have an administrator, and never have. I went through all of the settings on both YouTube, and in my phone settings, but to no avail. I am an adult, I dont need YouTube to filter my content. I dont know why, how, or when this started, but its extremely frustrating, and ruins my entire watching experience. I can no longer comment, read comments, or watch the creators I enjoy. This app was phenomenal, and is now completely useless"
Typical google creation. A typical google app that spams you with advertising and tracks everything you do
Pretty good. I find that YouTube has a lot of good information on it.  The app could have better streaming features or be easier to use.  Such as turning off the screen or downloading the video for iPhone so that Im not streaming data all the time
"Wow. So, YouTube was fine for awhile, now it DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, it has no updates I tried cellular data and WiFi, I tried it on a different device, it just DOESNT WORK AT ALL AND I AM SO MAD.  Thank you for your time, also you MUST be careful on this you dont know what you will find.  If you are a tween try ItsFunneh"
"About 3 years & nothing has changed, just a lousy. I wrote the review bellow about three years ago. To this day it is still true. Whoever is in charge of app development at Google/Youtube needs to be fired and replaced. Sorry but that&#39;s the truth. -Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of commercials you are doing now and the incredible amount of money you are making by the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t get a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. The same bug that as been there for at least two to three years is still there. It keeps freezing occasionally.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app. It was doing better for a little bit, but the bug is just as bad now as it was before.Come on Google, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter"
Cant transfer any data to new emails. It is impossible to transfer my account to a new gmail  I cant even make my likes videos public either. YouTube puts way too many restrictions on unnecessary things
"Not worth. Not worth it if you care about your data privacy, time, or user interactions. There is much better options and those options care about both their users and creators"
YouTube. I just love YouTube I love the documentary I love the information I learn from it I just love YouTube everyone should have the YouTube app and its absolutely free with your data
1984. YouTube censors everything.There government  funded CIA Front along with Alphabet.There are corrupt and crooks and sell your data and steadily profit off of you.Its confident but trash overall
Too many ads. See aboveThanks for wasting data
Meh. There needs to be an option to play videos always on the highest settings. I have unlimited Data and I have 1g speeds on WiFi. They always start at 360p and its very tedious to have to change the quality every time I watch a video. I hate the stupid stories and never watch them. If I wanted to watch crap like that Id get Snapchat and there needs to be an option to disable them. Recommendations is always showing videos Ive watched and it gets very tedious having to click not interested or itll recommend crap from years ago that Ive watched already. Nothing new ever comes up in recommended so I have to literally search up new videos are YouTubers. This app is just ridiculous that Im almost ready to stop watching and just go to P0rnhub to watch stuff
Video Edit Errors. After I publish a video it dosent let me edit the privacy Please fix this. I will give 5 star rating once its fixed because I wanna upload videos but I can change the privacy
"Performs Well; Convoluted Settings Management. My expectations werent beyond those of a novice user so few complaints here about performance.  True that some videos are recorded with very low audio pre-gain so that their playbacks on this old iPad are almost inaudible to my aging ears.My real complaint is about how difficult the settings menu makes it to delete my own comments history and my viewing history.  There is no select all or delete all function so it must be done one deletion at a time.  Try doing this a few hundred times every so often.  Further, it is very obtuse to discover how to delete comments: go to profile (allowing further access via web page instead of through the app), then settings, then it becomes really difficult so that I cant even remember now what menu description it is hiding under.  You Tube is being comedic in the way it offers you an opportunity to deleted this content yet wont easily release this offer from their tightly clutching fist when you try to use it.  It only matters so much to me because of the degree to which they (YT, Google, Quora, etc.???) collaborate through their cabal to build data profiles on everyone. I simply quit Quora once I discovered the profile data was leaking into YT and Google"
YouTube. Something keeps messing with my phone and on history that it says that I watched it showed up something stupid that I never watched that was on my history. Something hacked me
Good but one thing. So Im a small youtuber and I want to make videos and grow but I cant make thumbnails and I have to be verified but I have to delete YouTube app and do some stuff and I dont want to risk losing all my videos and data
YouTube is the greatest. I love being able to access almost anything on YouTube. From how-to videos to documentaries YouTube has it all. What an incredible blessing
"Ads. Selling ads pushing altered, and fake information in political elections. Not cool"
"Now its useless. Full WiFi, full mobile data, YouTube tells me Im offline. Instagram plays videos, YouTube works on PS4 too. Absolute joke"
"Essential. You tube premium has been my one stop shop for everything. Ive had amazing times, celebrating life listening to music and texting people directions to the after party, and bad times where I turn my data off to get away from reality while listening to my offline playlist to melt reality away. You tube was there for me during both. And its cheap "
"Money Grabber. Dont use unless you are paying them the premium fee. Basic one just shoves invasive privacy ads and is super annoying. Just trying to watch a free video and could care less about a ad.Youre better off using q web browser you tube with an ad blocker, works just fine, even though the you tube app is way better, I would rather suffer a cheap ad free web browser, thanks alot youtubeAlso, 4k movies rentals wont play in 4k on a PS4, but you can watch the trailer in 4k, what a rip off of rentals I got...pure shame"
Its ok. I pay for Youtube Premium every month since it was YT Red (grandfathered in to old price that was worth it because it included Google Play Music (and still does for me) just so I have the ability to download videos for when I go to work since I dont have Data. Requires me to only need a $20 phone plan per month but now with the changes constantly happening to the Roku and phone apps making it more of a pain to navigate Im not such a huge fan.Its fine and does its job but is still massively glitchy after years
5 stars just 1 problem. Love it tho recently when I upload a video its goes in private so I could only see it when I put it to public I tried editing it and putting it in public but it just says Error saving data Can you please fix this (heres my yt:Rat In The Trash)
A idea. Hey YouTube I have a idea what if you can chat to people on YouTube cause what if you dont have a messaging app or a email but you want to talk to youtubers I know this is like tictoks feature but you dont have to be subscribed to each other that would be good and what if you need to give them information on something but you dont want other people stealing your information this was just a thought but I hope you do do thisThanks for reading
"I use youtube 24/7 but. So before going on vacation, i downloaded a huge playlist of videos. Like maybe 300. Ofc not all downloaded but when i went to check the next day none of the videos were downloaded BUT it still took up all the storage. So i had 10g worth of data on my phone yet i couldnt see or delete the downloaded videos"
"CENSORSHIP IS OUT OF CONTROL ON THIS PLATFORM. This is Big Brother technology that would even shock Orwell.  They are so brazen, and so unaccountable, that they will cross any privacy line or squash any rights that you think you have, just to push their agenda. Oh and make as much cash as possible but I really cant hate them for that"
Its almost a life changing app. This app has literally become my best friend   I get all answers to my questions and topics I had no Idea that really do exist I spend a lot of cash buying data daily but I never feel bad cause I get 10 * value and discoveries. With most of the blocked websites in my country their content is always available here
"Issues. Every since the last update, Ive havent been able to connect to YouTube with my regular data"
"Intermediate. Honestly who doesnt love YouTube but can you fix your ads, I have data on running all day but when I choose to watch a video were the internet is good the as will always choose to lag like I dont understand why I get ads if they lag just dont give it to me. It makes me wait Longer just to satisfy your needs"
Just what you need when you need it. Just what you want when you want it  just what you need when you need it U tube has never let me down wether its data abou5 how to do something or just top notch vids when your bored and need a funny or syfy fix  I love it xxx
"Too expensive, lacks quality content... way too much garbage. Too many ads to use for free, and subscription costs way more than the major tv/movie services.. hard pass what is largely 99% garbage.Ooh, and to really pound the nail into the coffin looks like they track she share everything... oof. Google, the best spyware"
"The Best. You Tube, for me, is the best source of true data on important areas like science, art, world politics, and entertainment. I consider it a friend and a valuable companion during this difficult time, where it has given me much needed information. I just love You Tube"
SHAME ON YOUTUBE. SELL OUTS. YouTube is no longer for the people. Its main priority is getting on their knees and pleasing the big advertising bell-ends. Absolute SHAME
"Good but few problems. Good app, but the new age restriction feature is dumb. I was trying to watch a scene from attack on titan and it said I needed to verify my age. I would be happy to if it didnt require my bank details or an ID with personal information. It is not a good way to verify my age, by asking for information, that I, and I assume many others, are uncomfortable giving. Also these double ads are annoying and also when they cannot be skipped. There is no point having these double ads. I understand you want people to buy youtube premium but its not gonna work no one wants to buy it theres no point"
"Pathetic . Why the heck I need to select the video quality everytime I use the app ? Why can&#39;t I default it ? It&#39;s me who is going to pay for my wifi or data charges, and I want to watch every video in the highest possible resolution. Does YouTube have any problem with that ? I didn&#39;t know YouTube development team is still in the old mindset"
Its privacy. It gives very vague info on how to search what you want
Could be a lot better with age. The implementation of the age verification on  lots of videos is absolutely terrible where it says I have to use my credit card or passport to verify my age. I see this as a breach of my privacy as an adult I shouldnt have to show sensitive information to large company in case it gets hacked or my identity gets stolen
"Use Youtube a lot, but now I cant even logout?. I searched the faq on how to logout of the Youtube app, and that info is outdated or just didnt work for me.I guess tracking me for targeted ad is more important than the user ability to simply logout of the Youtube app"
Sell outs. The amount of ads that pop out are ridiculous. Cant even watch a 40 second video with out having to watch a 15sec ad
Communication. As a channel user owner I wish there was an easy way to communicate with the you tube company. As convenient as a live phone conversations
Unhappy. Every time we try to watch a video. It changes to PRIVATE. Whats up with that?
"It would be five star if we could upload videos without giving away personal info. I was going to upload a video but as soon as I saw I had to give away personal information I was broken so bad my mind was crying . I wasnt really crying but I was real angry frustrated and upset.Editors, I hope u read my review"
Love it but I have a new idea. So I thought about this for a long time what if you add a privacy where the video doesnt appear on your channel but does everywhere else
Ads are terrible and ruin music playing. Crap ads. No one needs their data stolen by ads
"My personal review. I very rarely log into YouTube and watch content anymore. Between the never ending blitz of surveys, interactive ads, ads that wont end for sometimes 5 minutes or more if I dont press skip, the double ads, the terrible algorithm for suggestions, the seeming commercialization of content compared to what used to be exciting and original, and lets not forget I get asked to get premium EVERYTIME that I log in. Id say I use this for more than ten minutes maybe twice a month if even that these days. TikTok is better. Your original platform full of creativity and quality has been corrupted by greed and profit pandering and now it has become a secondary uninteresting place to find content"
Use full of information. We have to select the information to improve our knowledge
"A disgusting piece of personal information robbing software. Too many commercials, and now it pauses every 27 minutos to inquire if you still want the videos to continue playing it is really obvious the focus is more in serving commercials than videos"
"Hooked. Loving it YouTube is my number one source of interaction, information and resources to all my needs. I find it very useful. As in the middle of this pandemic, YouTube has been my companion and my social way to interact. I use it for personal growth, keep up with the news, ongoing issues with current events. Worship and spiritual growth. Gossips as well. Love it Thank you guys for your support to the community service. God bless. "
Used to be great Petty no Picture in Picture. Ever since the release of the paid subscription you have increased the adds. It is sad that you also hinder the ability to use Picture in Picture. Google greediness at its finest. You already steal all our personal information just to use your services so we shouldnt be forced to watch ads or have to pay not to. Big corporation greed at its finest

Doesnt let you use with account signed out. App is forcing to sign in with google account so they can track search data and serve ads. It wont let me cast to a screen too. Totally unacceptable YouTube/Google team
This new resolution thing tho. Love YouTube and overall I think the app works pretty well. Ive had a lot of issues in the past but this one takes the cake as the most pointless over complication.I know how resolutions and data usage work and I dont have to worry about how I use my data because I know how to manage it. Please add an option to turn off all this extra for me personally useless supplemental information so that I can just pick my resolution for myself as I need. The auto button from before works just fine for this sort of filtering and theres no reason why you guys cant just add into the settings a way to adjust how auto determines what the optimal resolution would be.Youre making it harder for me to go about my day with YouTube in the background instead of Spotify. If you dont want to get edged out for my time please reconsider how much youve cluttered up my screen
Misleading political information being allowed to exist on your platform. Why is it that some content can be easily reported while others such as blatantly proven political information can not be reported. Your platform is behind the curve
Have to give away my privacy. Seriously why do I need to grant you permission to my microphone and camera just to be able to upload a video from my camera roll. You are only entitled to my camera roll. Not blackmailing a poor consumer into giving access to their phone when its not needed
"Disaster since selling out to google. Title says it all. They removed the ability to comment on many videos, annotations, the ability to add certain videos to playlists, and now the dislike button. Theyre censoring honest feedback. I used to really enjoy this platform, truly. The double, now triple no-skip ads making me wait a minute to watch a video Im not even sure is good quality? Not worth it in the slightest.Number of times this 1-star review with my honest feedback has been deleted: 0"
"Harder to rely on. I use the platform a lot for reviews on products, instructional videos etc. It was a god send to find a video with the information you need with the assurance of the community to validate it as a reliable resource of information, especially when your DIY project or product you wish to buy will mean a lot of time and money spent investing into. While you can still see the comments on most videos to determine how well you can trust a videos information, the elimination of viewing the dislike bar has made it annoyingly more difficult to get a general consensus of the topic at hand. I can also see this being a hazard when the information someone tries to look up could have fatal consequences if not done correctly ie: medical/ first aid, chemical, machinery etc"
Pushing white supremacy propaganda. No matter how many times I use stop seeing this ad or any other Google settings I continue to be bombarded with white supremacy propaganda ads. Its bad enough these bad actors are given a platform but being hounded by these ads is unacceptable. You collect data yet cant seem to utilize that data. Edit: Wish I could go half a star. The alt right propaganda this platform pushes is insaneEdit:edit: another round of right wing call to violence advertisements have gone live. Funny how I never see left leaning advertisements while my analytic data should easily target me for that type of advertising yet I see terrorist right wing advertising that are literal calls to action for violence
"Power gone awry. You tube, like face book and Twitter has not the slightest idea what to do with itself. It rules its domain with a human capriciousness and computer driven illogic that is both an affront and just nonsense. The main problem with companies peopled by youth cultures spit out of our failing universities is that they make the mistake of equating their own technical ability with wisdom and post modernism with something applicable. They do damage to good people and both censor content and scramble its location in ways they think benefits them and most definitely does not benefit the user. Social media are the robber barons of modernity, they do not steal your labor as their namesakes of the past, they steal your data; everything you do, everywhere you go, everyone you know, everything you say. They gorge themselves on money from selling and reselling every thing about every body while setting up the tools of control so perfectly individualized they await only the single command of a totalitarian leader to yoke every living soul to a single will"
"Deletes views. Idk whats going on but yall need to figure that out. Im super disappointed in you, YouTube. Sorry if you feel offended that a Kpop group is getting so many views, but deleting their views just makes your data unreliable "
"An ad dispensary. The app itself functions perfectly fine.  However, the amount of ads that they push, the timing of said ads, and their frequency is ludicrous. I will be forced to watch an unskippable ad with 1 second left on a video, get that last second and then the next video starts with the same unskippable ad. With the amount of our data Google sells we should get videos ad free"
"Who needs broadcast TV?. I love the versatility of YouTubes accessibility and the diversity of its offerings. I use it for entertainment, information and educational reasons. It has even made medical information available to me thats specific to my rare disorder, completely transforming my life"
Newbie to creating a YouTube channel. It would be helpful if YouTube could make it easier to post unlisted (semi-private) multiple videos to send. Something easy and intuitive like a simple check button in front of the video picture and then a share feature
"Inform users. Provide more information on all the capabilities that are available to premium users, along with instructions on how to access them"
"Uploading all videos as private. Its uploading all of my videos as private even when I set it differently. And when I try to edit it to fix the privacy setting, it keeps saying that theres an error. I need this for work while in quarantine and suddenly cant use it since the update. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE NOW"
;-;. For some reason all the videos I post are on private I change it to public then it says error saving video data
YouTube is awesome. So I love YouTube I really like how if u subscribe and click the bell u get a notification when people post u get notified so youtube is great it is fun also I love the spy ninjas THEY ARE AWESOME THANK U for making YouTube and letting me see them
"Glitch. I uploaded a video but it automatically made it private even though I put public, and reuploaded 4 times and still puts it as private, and I edited the video as public but it said data can not be saved please stop making my videos private, I wanna post for my subs"
One star for One liner update summary. In the world of hackers and privacy concerns YouTube updates barely give any details around why the app requires an update.To make them read my comment I have given them one star
"Stop deleting views. Your bots, in terms of demonetization and keeping track of views DONT WORK and when people call you out on DELETING MILLIONS OF VIEWS you basically say it happens AND NEVER FIX IT. YES IM TALKING ABOUT BTS BUT MANY OTHERS TOO. YOUR VIEWERS AND CONSUMERS ARE MAD. FIX IT"
Keep politics out. Your Political efforts to enslave individuals for personal profit will result in competition being more determined to replace you
Stop the censoring of free speech. YouTube is claiming the reason for disabling the dislike button to be so small creators are protected from hateful viewers but in reality these creators can still see the dislikes on their personal channels. The real reason for this removal of the dislike button is so peoples opinions on political videos and the videos of mega corporations can be silenced. This is not the only concern with the removal of the dislike button. Hypothetically if there were an instance where someone was choking to death and someone needed a video of how to preform the Heimlich Maneuver and could not discern the quality of the video by judging the amount of dislikes the person that was choking could die due to the lack of sufficient info on a videos topic or quality. This direct discretion of the freedom of speech is not only unjust but it could potentially put lives at risk
"Thieving Fs. Okay Google, youre taking away Google Movies, of which Ive purchased many for offline viewing only, the only method of watching these is via YouTube, with data only, if thats the case, if your app wont allow downloads the day you take down GM, I want a refund for every movie, tv show, Ive ever purchased, small claims court if not, up to you"
"Just a lousy app full of bugs. Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of commercials you are doing now and the incredible amount of money you are making by the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can get a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. You can&#39;t even out s &#34;Back&#34; button and the app keeps freezing, and it&#39;s full of bugs. Someone at Google needs to be fired. Lousy"
"New Share Button and too many ads. Why would they put a share button in the middle of the main screen. Absolutely stupid. Looks like an attempt to gain access to peoples personal information. ShadyThey have also added commercials on sponsored content. In addition it does not allow you to skip.Time for a new venue Google has been bad since the beginning, but now they are horrible. I feel bad for those who must remain to earn a living.They should expand the ratings into the negative numbers. -5 stars in my opinion"
Get rid of the ads. Get rid of the adverts I want to watch without them
"Ads are out of control. They tried to get me to subscribe to the pay version by providing original content, but I wasnt sold. Now they are bullying me with endless ads before, during, and AFTER videos now.Besides that, I find the app bogs down a lot.Otherwise, I use it, like the crappy Facebook app because its better and has the content than any competition.  So they dont have too much to worry about"
Stop asking if Im still using it . Stop pausing the videos after 4 songs either make it an option for people to turn on if they choose or remove it completely. I can determine myself how long I would like to listen to music for and if I run out of data cause I left YouTube on for too long thats on me. Wouldnt it be better for you to just let it play? With adds you will make more money if I forget about it. Just let me listen to music
Video quality settings. Hate the new settings. I understand youre trying to help people save data but now its just making it more annoying to have to do another step just to watch in the best quality. Having it on Auto doesnt always give you the best quality while on Wi-Fi
Reason for rating. Love the videos.  Many are a great source of information.  HATE the ads. Choices  I refuse to pay to reduce the ads
"Messed up new quality settings. This is so annoying first YouTube only had the advanced quality options which I could put my preferred quality settings like when Im on WiFi at my house I like watching it at 2160p or 1080P and the new options like high quality it just puts it at 720P for all and then when I put my own advance quality option it doesnt work like for example I put 1080p it still keeps it at 720P and then outside it puts every video at high quality, I like it at the lowest on LTE but it keeps it at the highest so please remove high data, data saver options and just keep the original advanced options because this new option doesnt work good"
"Restricted?. TIRED of my app being restricted and I cannot turn it off. Cant watch certain videos and cant see comments on ANY video at all. None of the instructions that they provided to fix the issue works either. The app only fully works on my wifi at home. As soon as I need to use my data, it doesnt. And my network provider has not done anything differently. Get it together, Google"
"Incredible. Most apps have more limitations than their websites. However, this is not the case for YouTube. I find it just as easy to watch videos on the app. The layout is clean and similar to the website. It is nice to be able to watch videos when out and about in an easy way"
Say no to Google. Data collection for AI learning goes for all Google products
YouTube keeps enabling restricted mode for no reason. I cant watch half of the channels I am subscribed to when my internet stops working because switching to data triggers YouTubes bull**** alert
"YouTube. Great, but all the add breaking in is killing the experience of what was a brilliant offering. Encountering the same ad 100 times their damaging the brand, not helping it. I dont want pyramid schemes or I can promise you the Earth ads ruining the experience or eating up my mobile data thank you"
"Restricted mode ridiculousness. Extremely tired of restricted mode constantly coming on and then getting grayed out so I cant turn it off on my personal phone on my own service. Between the constant ads and this, I am skipping more and more videos"
"What happened with last update?. 3-13-2021I just updated my YouTube app. and there is a BIG problem  On the home page, there is a variety of videos.  Each video, to the right of the video title, shows three vertical dots.  I used to be able to click the dots and select Not Interested or have the channel permanently removed.  I no longer see those options when I click on the three dots  Why?  There are a lot of channels that I totally wish to never see appear on my screen as I am not interested in the subject matter, etc.  With this update, it appears I just have to live with videos appearing that I dont like or am offended by.  Please put back in the ability of each viewer to select not interested or have the channel permanently never appear again.  I have used YouTube for over ten years, and if this new change isnt fixed, I will not be using your app again.I just found out that those options to choose reappear within the three dots, but only if I sign in to the YouTube app.  I never had to sign in before so why am I being required to sign in now?  I dont like apps. trying to get more information about me or my viewing habits.  Its an invasion of my privacy"
"Its YouTube. Tracks and sells your data, but pfffttt itll be fine"
"YouTube l. For months now, I havent been able to use he app with my data on, only WiFi. I dont know if anyone else has this problem but its annoying"
"Dont be a fool, you NEED to pay for YouTube. Yes its free, and Yes you should still pay. Why waste time watching adds? Do you realize how much of your life is wasted watching them? You can also download videos to watch later so you arent wasting data. Basically printing money at this point. And no Im not a bot. Orrrr am I?"
Having a problem. When I try to upload my videos get put on private even though I keep it on public and when I try taking it out of private it keeps saying (Error saving video data)
?. why is it that when i am on wifi my youtube automatically goes into restricted mode?? but when i turn my data on it goes off
Exclusive content. One of the best ways to check out exclusive content. And also upload personal content for the world to see. A lot of good entertainment/information in one place. 
"YouTube is more than just music. I am an engineer who is an innovator Broadcast engineer integration. Its like mind candy, people making things of all kinds from unusual parts or unusual applications. It exercises my mind out of the mundane and opens doors when everyone says not to go in there. A lot of people, more than not, are over the social sites, lets do something they all are saying. So we do I also run my music through my ear plugs and the guy that wants to chit chat breaking that creative, innovative trance like smashing you into a picture glass window, are blocked out Thanks for this incredible site I used to have to come home from work off nite shift, my wife was at work and daughter was at baby sitters. I would put on VH1 and hit record whenever one of my songs played. Then fill up a tape So I put in my tape to listen and watch Its freakin Barney. My 3 year old taped Barney over my songs"
Why do I have to sign into Google?. So now I cant access free You-Tube without signing into Google?? Is this new? Or was I hacked?  I had no prior notice
New updates. Absolutely incredible one of the best invention in this internet era. But these recent updates have killed this platform it used to be random people uploading online for fun now its jimmy fallon and these fake kid YouTubes who cant swear or speak their minds . RIP YouTube 2006-2018
COPPA. As many of you know that video creators have a requirement if their videos are for kids or not for kids. I understand its taking their privacy but why do you have to remove the comments if their videos a4e made for kids
"Goods intensified. SMG4 IS EPIC Okay, I think YouTube is a fun app to use. You can learn many things, use the occasional 360 view. And watch my personal favorite, memes. But after I watch four videos it will send me out. And another thing, I cant watch a lot of things. When I click it, it wont work. But other then that, keep it up"
Horrible. You guys let people go on here and dox others and put others personal info on this site it puts others in danger including children this should not be allowed
Best YouTube but glitches. I love to watch YouTube because I watch other You-tubers  like the spy ninjas or the ninja kids or I just watch my sisters play same vids and there so boring.....But that is not the point about me writing about this app of videos because when I play vids they all start to glitch so when Im at school the internet is on but when I play Minecraft or Roblox it doesnt let me in so this is why I dont like my mum cause she deleted all my cool appsSo this is why if you are in this situation just write a comment about it then
"Not happy with the latest update using too much cellular data. Previously, I could set the resolution to 144p while on mobile, and it would stay. Now, it keeps changing it every video, and its hidden away in advanced settings. I dont like the YouTube app trying to use up my limited cellular data"
Dont need all my data for advertising and tracking. Get f*****
"Enjoying YouTube. I enjoy this app. It makes it easy to find information or entertainment on my phone, tablet or computer. I use the videos for educational information as well as pure entertainment"
"BIG BUG. There is a bug where if you have data turned off YouTube still uses data. This messed up my phone bill hard, like Im a be hurting from this one real bad"
"Review. Every video you could ever want to watch and much much much more , then theres the adds, what an excellent way to use up all your data by watching adds that make people rich using your data . Not that they arent great adds but completely random and not even related to the selected video"
"Solid App and gets the job done. Its the YouTube App on your phone. Look so much cleaner than in Safari. My only complaint would be personal channel settings, but that best done on a desktop/ laptop"
Spying??. Wayyyy to many targeted adds you guys are freaking me out
Google spys me. I cant believe how much google knows more than I do
Robber. You tube just steals peoples money if they dont like what they post? Why even give them a channel? Isnt this what you tube kids is for?
Im addicted. Im deleting it. I waste a lot of time watching random stuff but I narrowed it down to only subscribing to 92 people who provide valuable information stuff I like to learn about. But even then I find myself going on the homepage and getting distracted its all about how you use it. Im going to delete all social media and meditate and see how my perception of reality changes. I love you guys watch after yourself. 
Wrong info. They advertise wrong information and spread hate
Remove auto play on feed. Videoed now auto play if that are at top of screen position without permissionREMOVE THIS Or allow us to disable itI have turned off auto play in settings but it does not affect the auto play in feedThis is the worst thing I have seen google do in a long timeCurrently the app is unusable if its just going to drain my data allowance on playing video as I dont even want to play
Problem saving videos. Unfortunately the same problem continues I know the videos are from the person that uploads such videos but I keep believing that YouTube must make the uploaders to add on such videos dont use it or private so we dont lost time saving or commenting on such videos this its the main reason I dont get the subscription to YouTube like in the past that the so called el romantico enamorado immediately after I waste several amounts of data decided to removed the video of los caminantes a video of several hours
"Everything You Could Ever Want. This app is so resourceful. Entertainment, diy, information, it has all of that"
Unreliable data. They kept deleting views and likes on videos
To much false information. Everythings Im on here your showing animal abuse false info on stimulus enough is enough
"Silences voices. In America I believe in free speech and equality. I believe that people have the right to give their opinion even if you dont agree with it. This platform along with others is protected legally from being held responsible for what those opinions will cause. The reason they are protected from this is so they can allow the freedom of speech. The only exception is for crimes being committed like calling for violence or things like that. Though I have witnessed so many things calling for violence involving BLM protests and incidents involving police, none of those videos seem to have a problem circulating.But when someone points out voting irregularities using FACTUAL data they get banned from YouTube. Or if someone talks about COVIDs mortality rate being exaggerated by media and this proven with data, YouTube bans them. I doubt this review will even be allowed because we all know they cant handle the truth being said. Its just sad and I hope there will be a real social media come out that will truly allow free speech to happen"
"Great example of developers sitting on their rear ends doing nothing. 11/26/2020: It has been a few month since this got got really bad. It has been bad for a couple of years, but now it nothing but trash. I want to start keeping a record of dates. Just to see if Google decides to fix the problem. So as of today, no change to the app or Developers just sitting on their rear ends.-Installed the latest update, and still freezes. ---Hey Google, how about you fire the lead developer and get someone in there that can dk the job? The app keeps freezing, specially after posting a commend. Sometimes I am going to post a comment and cancel it and it freezes as well. Come on, don&#39;5 you people already make a killing from the incredible number of ads and gathering and sales of our personal information? Put some money you make off of us to good use and FIX THE LOUSY APP -The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing A LOT when trying to post a comment. Specially on longer commands. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of ads you are forcing people to watch and the incredible amount of money you are making from the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t put together a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. SERIOUSLY How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
Ads. Ads None stop. Just eating away my unlimited Data
"It was great and easy to use and easy to find settings. Now you cant even change your video quality to what you want like how it used to list them.  Now it chooses for you even after changing the setting to highest quality it doesnt choose highest quality.  All the settings talk about is how more or less data is used even on the WiFi portion, and I have dont use my phone enough for data so Ive almost never had it, so I dont even care about that.  Just let me watch videos at an actually good quality without having to go through a hassle to change it.  And it doesnt even save which quality you choose from the video, even with that setting on in the settings menu.  Its so weird and kind dumb now"
conservatives enemy of youtube state. Funny how all the Lineral Youtubers want to sell you a VPN so Liberal big tech companies cant spy on you. Been youtube user for almost 20 years got booted for conservative comments. Youtube not gettng a dime from me
"Garbage. Keep having to uninstall every so often. Thats fine. I find myself using it less and less these days, so the fact it doesnt work right no longer matters. So many other sites to choose from that dont censor, so now I am using other sites that are more honest and informative. Looks to me like you tube will be sub planted. Oh yeah, if I see a commercial on you tube? ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT BUY THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT. SAW AMAZON ADVERTISED AND IMMEDIATELY GOT RID OF YHEM. Seriously though, I got rid of them as well, I JUST CANT STAND A GREEDY SELL OUT"
"Stop Miss leading, shame on you. Stop miss leading, controlling  and spying on people"
I love YouTube you should to. You should love you too because it can give you a lot of education but why give it four stars is because there is some privacy parts on there like parts do not meant to say so thats why I gave it four stars you should definitely get YouTube you should definitely download it because it can give you so much education that you never knew about thank you for reading my review goodbye
Thanks for not censoring. Super disappointed in other social media for refusing to show information and removing posts. Glad I can always find what I need here
"YouTube is definitely incredible . YouTube is the best method to learn any subject , mechanisms, excel software, Accounting software,  changing a tire on car,  cooking a certain dish,  checking out a specific movie , listening to specific music . Therefore, YouTube Is a positive teacher.  Therefore, Thank youYouTube and Stay Healthy and Safe from the Covid-19 ... Sincerely, AJB "
Ugh ads. Long back to back ads when I am logged into and using the app but not when using browser. Now I just open from browser rather than redirecting to the app. Punish your customers while tracking activity in the app - lame No ads from browser for the same video If youre having the same issue just search and watch the videos in safari private browser window
"Welcome to my life. I am so pleased that all my search and videos watched history is kept by YouTube and dealt with to the best bidder. My YouTube usage is a gold mine to any data dealer.Thank you, YouTube"
"YouTube is awesome. YouTube is an entertainment you can do many stuff on it like make your own videos and watch other channels there are people around the world that love YouTube and make YouTube videos mostly of the channels that I watch are That YouTube family,Sister forever,Ace Family,The Labrant Fam,All Around Audrey,Just Jordan 33,Emily And Evelyn and The Merrell Twins and no I do not have a YouTube channel.And that is why YouTube is awesome and also be careful you can get hacked or kidnapped sharing lots of personal things about you like your last name your address or you phone number"
The end of YouTube. YouTube isnt the same without the dislike button. Too much rubbish and junk out there and the only way I used to filter and not waste my time was by relying on the like ans dislike data. As soon as a new Platform opens Im out
"Video Resolution. How about we go back to numbers. Auto, Recommended, and Data Saver mean and do nothing. It actively inconveniences a majority of the user base that know what theyre doing with selecting a video resolution"
"Personalized Selection. YouTube is, as always has been the only webbrowser for visual entertainment. My (my personal experience) new to you and suggested is only based around videos Ive watched or are only Very closely related to what Ive watched before. Id like at least a seperate/individualized channel for the plethora of videos across the YouTube verse. Whether theyre in my selected language or not.P.S. I mainly watch YouTube on my Xbox One"
Ads. Wayyyyy too many ads asking personal questions it&#39;s annoying
Privacy Warning. You have none when using this app
PLEASE LISTEN YOUTUBE. YOUTUBE PLEASE TAKE OFF PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAYLIST AND STORIES THAT I DONT CARE ABOUT I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR RECOMMENDED PLAYLIST OF VIDEOS OR STORIES OF CHANNELS I AM NOT SUBSCRIBED TO
Why is YouTube 11 gbs. It makes no since your using my phone to keep the data instead of your servers this is retarded I dont even have 11 gbs of videos downloaded
"Spying on you. So I have an iPhone, whichs tells you if your new screen is being recorded or not. Whenever I go onto the YouTube app then exit, it shows for a brief second that my screen is being recorded. Every Single Time. So download at your own risk"
Help centre. The Annoying thing about YouTube is there no help centre to talk too but you can send feedback but I personal prefer to talk to someone
"No privacy. They sent me 5 adds based off my last 5 searches on safari, like really, common utube stay in ur lane"
Add new feature. It would be really cool if you add the messages feature so people who want to talk privately can go to the messages feature so we can have more privacy I hope you will add this feature and besides that everything is really good
"Shame on Google. First off they demonetize all the gun related channels, now they wont update the app because of Apples new policy of having to show all the tracking that they do. So long Google, I will no longer use any of your services and all my accounts are closed"
Scammers. This Developer Is Using this App For Phishing linking the App to Facebook twitter instagram linkedin Stealing DataScammers&#39; PatrolFor Big Businesses Invasion of Privacy &amp; Stealing Personal Data
The YouTube app is great. You can skip through long videos and see a little picture of where your at on the video. There is a mini player so you can scroll while watching videos. It doesnt take up data on your search history. The only complaint is coppa seriously did a number on it and as a result I havent been using it as much
Disgusting. Imagine deleting views from people that didnt even harm you. Nothing personal really just facts
Great App. Terrible new updates. Love the YouTube app. I have YouTube premium and when the features for downloading and background play were added I thought the app had reached its peak. But the new updates are ruining that experience. Hiding the comments in a sub menu is just terrible and that menu is very easy to miss. I also don&#39;t like the huge new thumbnails for auto play videos. The home screen is littered with things I&#39;m not interested in then slightest about.Overall I have no internet at my home so I use YouTube with my mobile data and so I must continue to use the app. Because at least it&#39;s better than in browser experience
Best platform YouTube. If you only used 1 platform YouTube has so much information and is so much fun to use cant imagine how one could get so much info Every picture tells a thousand words Every video tells a million
Google Data Mining is BS. Read the title. You pricks
YouTube. I cant seem to access YouTube unless Im on WiFi. I turn data on for YouTube and when I go to access YouTube the data turns off and I cant access anything on YouTube
Stop spoon feeding us news per your political views. You makes us watch your fricken commercials. now at least let us watch what we want to watch we want to watch what we believe and if I feel my vote has been stolen you blocking those story convince me they are true Is but one example
My data can afford highest quality. Plz dont categorize video quality by your thought. I do enjoy 2k even 4K in my screens and both my internet and data could afford it
Privacy Nightmare. Better to view content creator videos directly on Patreon or Nebula
"YouTube review. Basically the only channel that I do to for my tv, news and information. Thats incredible. Thank you for providing this service.D.W"
Only source of information that I use. Its better than tv but the two commercials is damaging it
Stealing view. Why take at least 57 million views away from BTS on video? Is it because its KPOP? Because theyre asian? Because theyre feminine? Is this a xenophobic act? You guys should acknowledge what youve done and give the views back as well as the record we broke with hard work
"Dont get crazy my monitoring. You tube is good, I love my privacy. So dont start with the monitoring. I would not enter any cussing or nudity"
My one complaint. Oh the increase in ads/commercials is actually painful Theres no warning either. You can be listening to a Ted talk or a serious subject matter... hanging on every word and mid-sentence COMMERCIAL. Then another and another. I love YouTube but everyone I know is actually over it because of the ads. I actively refuse to buy or support anything the ads are for because of the annoyance which I dont think is the aim. Please scale back the level and frequency of these THIRSTY ads We get your tracking engagement but the humanity
Update please. Sketchy company. You guys seriously needs to update your app. Dont try to get away with new apple privacy policy
This app is no longer shared with you. I have been receiving a notification saying that the YouTube phone app is not available for use and that I must purchase it from the App Store following each use requiring me to delete and re-download  following each use
Love YouTube. I always enjoy watching video music and all kind of information on you tuve
"Great content useful information, adds are too long. Thats all"
"Ads. Why are there so many darn adds, its annoying and I am deleting this app and getting information elsewhere"
"Consistently undermines creators and viewers. I originally rated this 1 star for horribly unaccessible comments, but now Im full on deleting this app, there may be good creators, but that doesnt mean the app is deserving of mining any bit of your personal information for ads.Dislike "
Overreach. I like all the new technologies including YouTube you provide a great platform and .you earn a great deal of money using our data ..I am happy to pay for premium services  when I am ready and when I am sure that what Im paying for is mine to keep not borrow so can you provide this service
"Requires Network Access Now. Google never used to require network access in order to open the airplay menu. Now it does. This is a massive invasion of privacy being used to block off functionality within the app.It can still be done using the control center, 3D/Force touch on your now playing item, and airplay but... this is a stupid workaround.Actively hiding Apples functionality in the name of gathering data should not be allowed"
Personal Review. I love to watch YouTube all day and night 
"Give us back our views. I like YouTube but the fact that you guys just decided to delete views from the BTS music video ON is very offensive. Those views were not bots they were the hard work of ARMY. Am telling yall better get back in track. You dont mess with fans like ARMY, once you give us back the views I will come back to give you a 5 star until then 1 star is what you deserve"
Views. Youtube deletes views from music videos while fans are trying to reach their personal goal and help their favorite artist
"Communist Supporters: Went from all good to all bad. YouTube deletes content (Can't even find videos I want to see), they removed the dislike button because joe Biden was getting no love and they censoring everything. If you value freedom and privacy, Google, youtube and facebook are not your friends"
"I love YouTube. I am 60 years old and I am so grateful for YouTube ...I have been enjoying it now for about five years and I think its absolutely incredible. I have been able to find so many things of importance and then also things that are not so important. But the information is amazing that you can get from YouTube not to mention the entertainment. I dont have TV in my house ...Who needs TV with YouTube ...I can even stay up on current events or go all the way back to watch Johnny Carson, the Beverly hillbillies just comfort food. I love it allI cant say enough  thank you so much to the YouTube people that make it all happen. God bless you all especially in this time of the coronavirus with all of us shut  in I am grateful God bless you all"
"one star. because I couldn't give it zero stars. how dare they force us to do surveys without paying us for that data and make them unskippable. And the ads have become very invasive it's worse that television for some videos The creators don't get paid enough and videos have become next to impossible to monetize. This website is evil and I can't wait for something better for creators and their audience to come along. rip Youtube, I have what you've turned into"
Nobody likes ads. Worse than television. Ads are overdone.What a waste of time and data Watching 2 commercials for a 15 second video is nutsVideos stop so ads can play. Video suggestions will pop up COVERING my screen during while video plays.More ads when scrolling. Ad will even play when the video&#39;s over It&#39;s irritating for everyone
"Lame Updates. If youre going to collect and sell essentially every aspect of my personal life, the least you could do is include a proper changelog when you update your apps, you shady profiteers"
"Issue with uploading videos. Every time I upload a video, it always ends up uploading in private and I did put my privacy to be public it just keeps uploading in private and no one can see the video"
So um I have another problem. I chose my YouTube name I didnt have a channel but it said I did. Now when I go to manage your google account and click personal info it says the YouTube name ( that I made as a joke) as my name . :( and I know that my name is not Leafy_ Playz So can someone help me. Plz
"Love the option to refuse certain propaganda channels. Ive been so tired of having FOX or OAN or NEWSMAX show up on my news channels. Finally, I have been without their constant bombardment of FAKE news, when I search for information on the GOP and other terrorist organizations"
"Cant believe how horrible it is. It is unbelievable that you cannot change your banner and profile picture etc on your mobile device. It makes it that much more difficult for people. Also, you make it impossible to reach you when there is an issue such as a huge creator being hacked and not being able to reach you. You are their only source of income, and you might cause them to LOSE money because of the hack. Absolutely unbelievable. Get it the hell together"
TOO MANY COMMERCIALS. YOUTUBE COMMERCIALS FILLED WITH LYING OBJECTIONABLE POLITICIANSIn a purely capitalist society with NO oversight - capitalists ALWAYS ruin things.  Youve stolen our information in exchange for the service but NOW you want to steal our information AND makes us pay you to steal itGet off the capitalistic merry go roundWhatever positive experience one is suppose to have during a presidential election was TOTALLY ruined by your incessant commercials...ad nauseum
Used to be good. Before the user was turned into profit. Removing the dislike button so you have another piece of information to sell to people is disgusting
Great app but. There a massive glitch where when you post a video even when you select public it posts privately then when you click public it says error saving video data the only way around this is to click share then it makes it unlisted then you can click edit then click public I dont know why you guys havent fixed this
"Quality selection update. The new system is extremely frustrating to use, the app just eats data now, even if I changed the quality down to what I watch the 4 ads will play at 1080p.The app in general doesnt provide update info the updates are back side anyways, they dont respond to support and they dont care about reviews.The lack of competition made is making youtube worse everyday, but sure they fear ticktock so they made #shorts  the  worse thing they ever did"
"Privacy settings. Cant change my settings of playlists to private, the selection is not even available you can only select public or unlisted"
Youtube a spy?. For the past two days i have been noticing that every time i use the application the microphone has been up and sending data to the YouTube servers. YouTube dont tell me you are listening to my conversations to improvise your services It was fine when I didnt use to know that my microphone is on but thx to Apple now I know about your little mischief I would trust Siri over you
Dont keep defaulting to HD. I need to save data on WiFi and SIM card network. YouTube iPhone app doesnt respect the resolution quality that I select and keeps defaulting to HD next time I open the app. I am giving 1 star because of this. I will update after you fix this google. The Android app works as expected
conservatives enemy of youtube state. Funny how all the Liberal Youtubers want to sell you a VPN so Liberal big tech companies like google and cant spy on you how ironic. Was a youtube user for almost 15 years I am now a victim of the Socialist cancel culture for conservative comments. Youtube not gettng a dime from me
"Excellent App, Extraordinary Data Hog. UPDATE: Refuses to work on my iPad 2. Interrupts the app to say I need to update, then won&#39;t let me update in the App Store bc I run iOS9. I hate this. You bricked my iPad for no reason.This is a wonderfully thought-out app, one of the few things in the last decade that Youtube execs have actually sat down and thought about before spewing it out. This app deserves more than one star, easily, until you consider that it eats data like your monthly allotment resets tomorrow. I can stream 30 minutes on Netflix for 200 MB, or 15 minutes on Youtube for 1 GB. In addition, the app, WITHOUT any downloads or add ons, takes up OVER half a GB on iPhone storage. Holy fatcakes, Batman, what on earth is the point of streaming content from the cloud when so much content is apparently already downloaded on my phone? Isnt the point of streaming that your hardware isnt encumbered with loads of data, and we offload storage to external servers? Why on earth does a streaming app need over half of a GB on my phone? This by FAR exceeds any other apps storage requirements. #cookiemonster"
"Restricted mode ridiculousness. Too many ads. Extremely tired of restricted mode constantly coming on and then getting grayed out so I cant turn it off on my personal phone on my own service. Between the constant ads and this, I am skipping more and more videos.But seriously, the ads. Entirely too many ads. There are multiples on short videos, half the ads are double ads, and it ends up that I am experiencing three to five minutes of ads in a ten minute video. Im skipping a lot of videos because of the ads now"
Total garbage. Enjoy the world spying on your every move
"This new update to the youtube app is not ideal. While I can appreciate the attempt to make stream quality selection better. This new interface doesnt feel quite properly thought out and seems to be a solution to a non existent problem. Also, the automatic stream quality algorithm seems to be miscalculating. While streaming on wifi today, it has been  automatically choosing 360p each and every video even though a manual selection of the 1080p60 streams perfectly with neither a pause nor a perceptible buffer.But if it is to remain as is, I earnestly beg the design team to allow  the ability to manually select specific streaming resolutions to persist. Because when I need to use lower quality streams for the sake of data savings, I do not always need it pinned on 240pCase in point:On my tablet, while streaming on data, I intentionally choose 480p as the screen is bigger and that fits within my data plans data budget. Whereas on my phone, while streaming on data, i choose 360p to fit within in its allocated data plan while displaying a reasonably  pleasing image. But if im working on something, only then will I choose to stream at 240p as I only care about the audio at that point and not the image. Overall, this granularity is important to me as it allows me to enjoy videos at reasonable resolutions while staying well within my mobile providers data plans"
"Stop trying to force me to give you access. For some reason I cant tell this crappy app that I dont want to give it access to devices on my local network. Devices that dont exist, since I dont have any. I am not given a  choice to deny giving it access. The  only choice is to give it access now or do it later... choosing later doesnt help sine it does it every time I open the app.To me, this seems like another attempt to be given access to my data. That they will sell...  I really wish there was a good alternative yo YouTube"
I like to listen to YouTube wail I sleep except it keeps asking if Im still watching. I would just like them to get rid of the are you still watching notifications
how do i. how do i get rid of google llc and get inc or apps that dont include me and my family being spied on and posted on other sites?
Ok you really starting to tick me off. You have completely changed the appearance of my notifications just to mess with me and you also changed the Home Screen to show videos that could damage my reputation as my personal of my privacy so please change it all back
Frauds. Hey these guys (JASON HARVEY)are frauds they work within a network that develop apps via their employers enterprise accounts and commit fraud. Check out the privacy terms on this one. Its from 2012. They have entire data bases your phones accessing and whatever info you search for is what they want you to see. Chances are your cell is connected to one of their home internet accounts. Why? Because they can have the same number work on up to five devices. So when you use 2 factor auth guess what they get the code as well. If you use your home internet account you can sign into icloud and every device signed into your icloud account even if its not in the same location will work. They get free service and steal your identity and cash. Order things in your name using your cards to pay for it. The good ole state of Indiana knows about it and they do nothing. Whats that say..... well maybe some place that has thousands upon thousands that come to watch basketball could gain access to so many peoples private info Just look at the dates on the privacy on this app. Enterprise companies have access to device management and also app.goo.gl was a Google shortening link that all these apps within this app store are originated from that has been DISCONTINUED
Tge advertising. Just want to watch the videos rather than be sold stuff all time. Switching off
Why???. You guys actually spy on people what there looking for real messed up
"Annoying. Every time I open it an add comes up for YouTube premium and the privacy policy, I dont get the point of this happening every time I open the app or click on a video but its just really annoying having to close something Ive done a hundred times already. When I tried to open it today it said that the app was no longer shared with me, so could someone actually reply to a complaint for once and tell me how to fix it"
Some Bad Errors For Privacy. I Cannot Upload Anymore Public Or Unlisted Videos. :(Fix It Now Or I Will Never Upload Again
"inappropriate ads, let me report them. LET ME REPORT ADSADS HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE SOMETIMESJUST BECAUSE I AM OLD ENOUGH DOESN&#39;T MEAN I SHOULD HAVE TO SEE THEMi shouldn&#39;t have to change my preferences to get rid of them, i don&#39;t want there to be data collected on meill be a bit more specific in saying that what was being advertised was fine, but the images they used were sexual and this was an ad placed under the video not before itthis is annoying, just let me press the button to say hey &#34;they shouldn&#39;t be showing this in this way&#34;THE SAME AD SHOWS UP AGAIN AND AGAIN NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I SAY IT IS NOT RELEVANT BUT MOST OF ALL I WISH I COULD TELL YOU HOW DISGUSTING IT IS: the one that belongs next to a daily mail article showing you a disgusting picture of a mouth growth thing why on earth would i click on that"
"Brilliant app let down by extravagant monetisation. The app in itself is great. The video ads I dont mind. I do think I should be able to play PiP especially seeing as its a system level function, but I deal with it.The recent update however showing that my real name, physical house address, phone number and email address amongst a host of other things are shared with third party advertisers? Thats too much. They dont need that data and there should be an option to opt out. Ill stay away from this for a long time"
"Pay the artists who make you billions justly. And stop doing so much evil End the greed End the tracking, data harvesting, spying, support of authoritarians, etc"
YouTube your my favorite app. I am mad what I mad ? Fun fact coppa was on my YouTube channel and I cannot get rid of is can you remove data on YouTube app
Too many ads and no Picture in Picture mode. I find it incredible stupid that YouTube doesnt allow Picture in Picture mode for the new IOS.YouTube premium false advertises that you can but you actually cant watch anything you can only listen. Which is dumbSecondly wayyyyyyyyy too many adverts now its getting ridiculous. Its like they told YouTube users to please add more if they want to make more money. Kmt
"They took my data and now they take my dislike button. O free content providing service that I pay for not in dimes but in privacy violations, I demand the dislike button to be reinstated"
"internet issues?. Sometimes while watching youtube i will close the app, about an hour later i will go back on and it says something went wrong so i try turning my data off and back on, it still doesnt work. i even reset my phone and it still doesnt work. im not sure what else to do?"
"Above average streaming service. YouTube premium is juice that is undeniably worth the squeeze. Being able to set playlists and download them to my phone, listen to podcasts uninterrupted, and buy or rent any of my favorite TV shows/ Movies giving me the best of both worlds. Background play is an incredible feature and makes using YT in conjunction w/ other apps such as fitness trackers easy-peasy"
"Stop Miss leading, shame on you. Very bad website and hope, one day to take them to court for selling data in the black market, miss leading,   spying on people and controlling and support fake news to-mislead people, rudely YouTube have blocked Al Jazeera news to avoid sharing the truth about whats going on in Gaza and have blocked proPalestine accounts to avoid their voices to be heard"
"Pointless updates to UI need to stop. The last few changes to the UI have really ruined the app for me. Videos are buried between posts, and the information overload is disorienting. I also hate that it now takes multiple clicks to change the resolution. YouTube isnt saving me time by giving me options like Data Saver. 240p is sufficient for my screen size, and this new update is making an already frustrating process worse. I would really appreciate a setting that lets me fix my video resolution"
"Great app . YouTube is a fantastic app You can unlock Notifications to get Notified when someone follows you on your account (if you have one) or if an account you follow post a new video. I love this app and have had if since the day I got my iPad (2016-2017). There are millions of videos, and whatever type you like After you follow someone, once you go back to the home page, there will be some videos that they think you might like/or similar to the account you followed. To follow an account you have to press on the icon/profile picture below the video and it will bring you to the account you clicked on. After that, you will see a Subscribe button, and a Notification Bell. Once you click the Subscribe button, you will now be subscribed to that account, which means the home page will show videos you may like, or similar to that account/videos. The Notification Bell is a Notification button. Once you click that, that exact account will notify you if they post a video, comment, or someone subscribe to you. This app is basically an app with millions of videos in it, anything you would like If you need help, just click the little question mark (?) in the top, right corner and it will show you everything. Good luck - Fantastic app:)"
"Easy Access,. Good for information in everything"
Trash. So many adds Sorry app that needs to sell your data and feed you adds so they can make profit
"Transferring data. App is great. One feature should be added. Transferring all data from one yt account to another. For example the watch history, search history, liked videos, created videos etc, should be able to get transferred or duplicated into another account"
"YouTube is the coolest thing on the Internet. Ive enjoyed YouTube for many years, and keep exploring ways to discover information and history. The old media that has been uploaded, such as old tv shows, or personal videos - old 8mm films are so nostalgic. Old Music videos of my favorite artists from 35 years ago are some of the best at bringing out old memories and feelings from those good Ol days"
Only one mistake. Hey google my sis wants to watch my iPad cuz my mom took it away and it was stuff that was weird and it will stay on my iPad so I had to delete it and reinstall it can you a least put a button that will keep the data from last time or delete the data
"The best content on the PLANET. The privacy policy, that is, not the videos.Recommended if you enjoy thrillers, suspense, mystery/detective, cerebral or tragedy.If you&#39;re a fan of psychological horror or true-crime -- HIGHLY recommended"
Ad galore. Only download if you want to watch more ads than content. Absolute sell out
Stop wrongfully taking down videos. Stop taking down Palestinian content and stop targeting ASMR channels and taking down their videos Now you are asking for age proof by providing private information such as credit card and id. This is a breach of privacy and the right to free expression without fear of persecution
"GIVE us Our Hard earned views. We Army have been streaming for hours and hours to support BTS new video and we had a goal to surpass 90million views and you guys had the audacity to delete our hard earned streams of ON.you are loosing millions of viewers because you deleted 98million+ views.Shame on you all.Please give us our views back because we spent our time on your platform risking our phones battery,data,and getting it taken away by teachers.put back ALL the views you deleted"
Useless Recommendations. Hey YouTubeI get that I enjoy a channels videosBut why do you feel the need to recommend them to me days after I had already watched them?
Stupid ADs. Get rid of all the ADs when watching something
"Always something to watch. Always good information,and entertainment for me and kids"
"STOP SHADOWBANNING PEOPLE. When will you un-shadowban me YT?? My posts in LIVE CHAT on live-streams have been invisible for over 2yrs now. Ive proven this(video recorded) multiple times by using different devices from family members while using the YT app and youtube dot com website. I can see comments directly before and after mine appear in real-time on the app and the website, but MY comments are completely invisible.  And in case youre wondering.... NO, the channel owners have NOT banned me. I have close friends who live-stream that say they cant even see my posts in LIVE CHAT.  Also, I see MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SPAM BOTS whos profiles link to sexually explicit sites that are allowed to spam their crap in live-streams but me?? Oh no, I cant chat with anyone. You stifle MY free speech, but continue to allow links to pornography. That is absolutely sickening I can see where your priorities lie.  What a friggin joke yall are  Disgraceful"
"Google, Are you afraid to update?. How is this app not updated on the App Store in over a month? Did Google not just make some of the biggest profits ever last year? Surely they can afford to update this and their other apps on the iOS platform. Oh  and more thing, please be transparent about Data collection, people deserve to know what you are doing with their info on all platforms"
"Good but WAY too many updates. Good app, but too many updates, which takes up alot of my storage data. I dont understand why there are these short videos or betashorts. I liked the much previous versions from 3-4 years ago. Youtube isnt really Youtube currently... and not as simple as before, which I think was better"
"Not necessarily personal. Im just sick of it all. All the lies, misrepresenting, especially info suppression and the lack of acknowledgment when the reasoning behind the suppression is proven to have been invalid. If suppressing information benefits the narrative it will be done. Were seeing so much finally being revealed that would at one time get you banned. Jan 6 we just watched videos of cops waving people in the building and opening doors. The laptop which may bring down our countries cred beyond the Bidens. Vaccine side effects on and on"
"Fairness. Quit being biases. Do not become Tweeter or Facebook. Others will open and people will jump over. Always remember that Trump won and that it was stolen from him.75,000,000 people in the US will find other methods to get info other than that of UTube"
Google spys on u. Google and any other google thing spys on u so does Facebook
Refuses to use apples tools to frustrate users. Been struggling with googles use of airplay. And how they refuse to use the built in share sheetKeep hiding all the features built into the phone behind additional clicks. Picture in Picture? Its only a click and drag of a line of code. Nope gotta pay for thatgotta get that data somehow right?I wish there was a competing video platform. Monopoly much
connection. youtube doesnt work if you arent connected to wifi. my data wont let me use youtube pls fix
Its ok. It is freezing and you need to put the YouTube for WiFi and without data and wifi
Review. This is a very good app to upload videos and to watch them but something annoying is when people steal videos
Adv. Why every video has too many Advertise and they are no relate to  what I am watching
"Video quality setting. I liked being able to choose specifically which quality I wanted to watch a video on, but the new update makes me choose either data saver, high quality or auto... why? What if I want somewhere in the middle like 360p?"
CONNECT TO THE INTERNET SPAM. I WANT TO Watch videos but you keep telling me to connect to the internet even if im on the internet. I want to watch videos offline and online but you only allow online now I cant watch any videos because of this bug &gt;:(
Hello YouTube just a quick favour . In order to upload YouTube videos I need a account so I tried making one and it ask for my phone number and personal information  (no hate UWU) but can I be a YouTuber without an account so I can just tell my name and profile picture in the video For the next update please?Thanks for reading this YouTube you will make me happy if you do that
"Its the most amazing thing ever to be coded. Shark boyMooseUNSPEAKABLE GAMINGSuper Carlin Brothers (we nerdy) DANGEROUSLY FUNNYLogdotzip: cringe but great.These are my top favorite you tubers today. :)A friend, (for privacy reasons his name is now Todd), he was going through a phase in which he felt very cut off. I didnt know how to help him. Then all of a sudden, he was fine. I asked. And not like normal, he immediately told me. Its YouTube. He found a Youtuber, Logdotzip, who was funny, and he really seemed to understand Todd. And later he showed me the app.And, not only logdotzip, helped me take a breather and calm myself enough to cope with real life. It gives you a person whos  so real, whos actually doing this and, it helps me.There are a few glitches and whatever that are mostly reviewed in other reviews, but Im solely here to tell you why you should.Take my word for it. And it is COMPLETELY FREE: if you dont do the subscription, you can still comment, like, subscribe and whatever: it is the perfect app"
Video quality cap?. After a recent update I can no longer watch videos at high resolution using mobile data. What exactly is the point of unlimited 5G data with a high resolution screen if YouTube is going to apply a cap? I even have YouTube premium which makes this even more ridiculous
Ads. Sick of the ads in an attempt to make u pay when it just sends me elsewhere to find my info w shorter adds and no pop up of subscribe all the time It doesnt work it just annoying and not enough for me to pay
Stop collecting my data. I dont agree and will absolutely opt out if you collecting my information you sleazy worthless company
"Its my second LIFE. No TV. Cable or Internet except phone.on fixed income but thanks to free phone service of unlimited talk, text and data service makes it possible to have a life again. Watching your programs to keep you inform of everyday life again. Thanks to everyone on YouTube. As well as those that make the videos to bring them to me as well as others in same situation"
You Tube. I love YouTube I think the versatility on all newsworthy info is incredible
"Plagued with useless ads. Can someone sort out the adverts for goodness sake....? Just because I havent skipped past ONE doesnt mean I want 30 minutes of ads that dont appeal to me. Im sick to death of getting in the shower to listen to music only to hear one song and then a string of ads. I understand why theyre there BUT there are far too many between each video. Its getting rather annoying. In fact, Ive just deleted the app and you can shove my customForcing adverts on to people is wrong, I pay monthly for my phone contract and I do NOT appreciate my data being used up by having your fkn adverts forced on to my device. FUCK OFF"
"It keeps quitting and crashing on me. I have no idea what is happening, but YouTube you really need to fix your app. It keeps crashing and quitting on me, it is making me angry and annoyed. I understand  the coppa thing, but I just think it is going way too far. I also understand that you want to protect childrens privacy but in the end, how are those kids are gonna watch their favorite videos? They could use the YouTube kids app but I see them use the actual app instead of the kids version. Im sorry but Im just voicing my opinion, hopefully there will be an update to fix the crashing and the quitting problem"
"Only complaint is the ADs. I love watching YouTube.  I watch it almost more than the pay channels.  BUT, I liked it much better before it was sold and ads were added"
"Fun data. Entertaining  videos , good mood images, promoting good Can Do attitude, I can tackle a projects or find ways to get project completed, Great  history pieces,Someone explaining the James Webb space telescope or Quantum Physics Superb teaching platform,Entertain Learning Ive cut the cable tv cord All my content comes online I spend 2/3 of my viewing time on YouTube"
I need an answer please       (QUESTION PLEASE ANSWER). Every time I post a new video I put it as public and when its done rendering I have to change it back to public but that doesnt work and I have to get onto a new device I post on my iPad and when I try to make it public  it says error saving video data every single time I need an answer or at least some help
"Great but needs improvements. I love this app, I use it every day The one thing that bothers me is that you have to put in your email address when subscribing to a YouTuber, this is just my personal opinion, I am not putting any hate, that is just a reminder, apart from that, YouTube is the perfect app I love it so much"
Na Ogun go kill ena with stupid adverts way ena they do. I they use my data watch film ena still con they use advert disturb me it no go better for ena company na fire go burn ena network
Over the updates. Im over wasting my data for some dumb update with dumb one line explanation to why I should. Its probably better to say we found another way to waist your data even more adds
"Taking my information, 15 second ads back to back with no skip. No bueno. Lame but I do use it every day"
My mobile data keeps turning off for YouTube app. I have not been able to use the YouTube app on my iPhone because the mobile data for YouTube turns off immediately by itself. I restarted my phone and I deleted and reinstalled the app but I am having the same issue.  I need help on how to fix this
"My new favorite platform. I have been loving youtube. Theres ALLOT of information on there. Theres a global community. I dont participate on any other platforms, I just use YouTube for research on topics Im interested in. No dumb memes here The thing I wanted to suggest is that I wish there was a section where we could keep track of the comments we have posted on videos. I havent quite figured out how to tailor notifications, but I would say that some notifications get missed. Maybe have a tab for our interactions... yall know best Thank you"
Diverse Access of Useful Information. I like the fact that you can find detailed information on almost any subject
"Stop. Between removing the option to watch at 1440p resolution and hiding comments behind a wall, forcing me to look at strings of stories like its Snapchat, this app has gone to absolute s***. Its a shameful representation of google and how they treat their customers who dont chose to watch on an android phone"
"Fake accounts keep commenting on my videos. Several accounts or channels have been putting scam links on my videos in the comment section. To either steal my identity or get people to watch porn. Theyre all fake accounts or people hacking into real accounts, Im sure you guys know better than I do. Id appreciate if this issue would stop, thx"
"Had enough. They exaggerate so much with ads & surveys. A 20 minute video will have an ad every 3 minutes or so and its 2 ads and you cant skip them. They do this so people pay them monthly for youtube premium. Its an oppressive marketing strategy absolutely unacceptable. The features u get for youtube premium are basic. Save video for offline? Lol everyone has data now youtube premium is literally just to get rid of ads. This is them wrongfully consuming wealth. Its known to mankind that 99% of people hate ads so they will pay almost $20 a month to not see them. This is way to oppressive and exaggerated. Its ok, Judgement day is coming everyone will get the justice they deserve wether that is hellfire & poverty or heaven with gardens and rivers flowing beneath with endless blessings from our creator our lord. This world is materialistic. The hereafter is what matters but many are blinded to that"
No dislike info = no data = no people. Give back the dislike feedbacks. Youre just becoming a regular social network and that will kill the app
YouTube Review. YouTube is an amazing app for entertainment in my personal opinion its the best entertainment Ive ever gotten and I also make YouTube videos with my friend go subscribe to hes channel. Football @CardUnboxing45
Lacks quality control. Can no longer properly assess if a video is legitimate and helpful or linking to scams since the dislike button has been removed. Comments do not help as they can be turned off so quality control is completely gone. Especially dangerous when Im trying to find IT advice and am handling sensitive data
Privacy Collects Browsing History. Privacy Collects Browsing History
"Just too many ads. Well, feels like its all about ads. User data used to train the recommendation engine, sold to everyone and the ads arent stopping"
soaked with ads. when a video has an unclickable ad over 5 seconds at the start or mid roll ads I immediately head for the exit.  I refuse to watch the video. saturating context with ads is why I quit watching TV and Youtube is about to join them
Oof. When ever I try to open YouTube it makes it so I have to turn on the wifi with Cellular data:/
"A Lot To Learn. I use YouTube for watching things from my childhood or that I havent seen in a while. Lately Ive been learning how to new and different jobs, whether for personal jobs or making money its great to be able to watch a few videos and do a job I had no idea how to do an hour or so earlier"
"Horrible. Sloppy, cluttered, and extremely disorganized are the best words to describe this horrible app. Just to watch a simple video occasionally, youre required to swipe left, swipe right, swipe down, click on this, click on that, etc. This app isnt something you would expect from such a big company with unlimited resources, like Google/YouTube. Its more like a childs science project gone horribly wrong. Maybe if you guys at YouTube/Google would stop making the app so complicated, with all these useless features, maybe it would play a video, like it\'s supposed to. Try some simplicity, for a nice change This app is low-quality, poorly designed and over-complicated just like everything else associated with YouTube/Google/Android. They never seem to get ANYTHING right, unless it\'s some type of process or scheme to invade their users\' privacy or force their users to watch some invasive, irrelevant advertisement. (They\'re experts at that.) Edited: 2-7-21"
Data and tax theft. Update your app you cowards and show us what data you have been steal like g form is without our approval. Absolutely criminal. Do us all a favour and leave Australia you tax evaders
Globalist owned company. Delete this app it spys on you it is controlled by the cia
"Hate the new Update. Since the new update restrictions for childrens privacy, I cant listen to videos with multiplayer anymore. This update is annoying me very much because I am over the age of 13 and am getting the restrictions"
Ads. Sure would be nice to cut back on the advertising. Hate using up data for ads to load
YouTube. Good I wish it would work with no WiFi of data
"Changes to video quality. As a Premium member, I cant really complain about adverts etc. What is annoying however, is the uptick this latest version is costing in terms of data. No longer will videos just play in one quality, it changes each time. And say youre at the gym, one song plays at 144p, the next may be on 720 and youd never notice. I get theres a data-saver mode, but even this is using 3-4x the amount I normally would"
Revenue and review. My revenue data has been delayed for a while now but other than that the app is pretty good and operational while helping me stay ontop of the views
"SAVE TREN BLACK. Tech Lead and Matt Tran(formerly Engineered Truth) abused the copyright system on the platform to obtain and distribute personal information about a younger much less established youtuber, Tren Black. Please do the right thing and investigate this case"
Video quality cap?. After a recent update I can no longer watch videos at high resolution using mobile data. What exactly is the point of unlimited 5G data with a high resolution screen if YouTube is going to apply a cap? I even have YouTube premium which makes this even more ridiculous.The new tool for quality selection is not at all an improvement
Quality Settings. The Quality has made me really mad like when you turn on data saver its puts you on 720p which is not data saver more like data waster and the fact is it is never 144p which  is very annoying. YouTube was one of the best app and 8 would love to put 5 stars put the new quality setting have given it a 1 star. Please fix
"I love YouTube . YouTube is an amazing and inspirational app You can do so many things If you are looking how to bake, fix, or even edit something, YouTube has your back Its also a great way to get entertained Also, if you have a channel on YouTube, its a great way to be yourself and do what you love YouTube can also help grow your brain with learning videos There is so many things you can watch I would definitely recommend is app to lots of people Thanks YouTube for creating such an incredible app"
Great App. The app mechanics are great. Very smoothly well tailored. The data consumption and wifi loading however are rather poor. Mainly due to the commitment YouTube has to advertisements
YouTube is flipping incredible. YouTube is an amazing app where you can watch all of your favourite youtubers and you can put screen time on it as well it is an amazing app so hope you enjoy it
Appreciation. Thankful to be able to access data/media free at anytime after the event
Age  Verification. Great app but I hate how we now need to put in our personal info just to verify that were over 18 for a video thats for &#34;mature audiences&#34; we have &#39;YouTube Kids&#39; for a reason-
Quality Settings. The Quality has made me really mad like when you turn on data saver its puts you on 720p which is not data saver more like data waster and the fact is it is never 144p which  is very annoying. YouTube was one of the best app and I would love to put 5 stars put the new quality setting have given it a 1 star. Please fix
"I HOPE I CAN SET MY OWN DEFAULT VIDEO QUALITY     . I know how well is my network quality, and I will change it if I want to save data.I know that you are making things easy, BUT leave me the access"
"PiP. I personally only use Picture in Picture when watching things. Im a very busy person. You tube REFUSES to add this feature but Im certain when they do it will be behind the YouTube premium wall, which is also disappointing. Im hoping yall see this, and fix it soon. There are also a couple of other bugs and stuff, but those r life. Though, I dislike when you make a playlist its private. When I click the private button its still visible"
"Picture in Picture. I find it absolutely ridiculous that Google has the nerve to say that we have to pay a premium for this app just to get picture in picture functionality on an iPhone. Every year I slowly move further and further away, and distance myself from Google and their apps and lack of privacy. For me this will probably be the final nail in the coffin"
"Terrible Job At Keeping Track if Views. Sabotaged artists many times by deleting views, deleted over 60M+ views from BTS"
"Just a few things :]. Before I say anything else, this app is great. I love being able to watch so many different videos and its really amazing. However, I wish you could select videos in Watch Later or History to delete or anything else instead of having to do it individually to each one. Besides that, this is pretty much perfect"
"Updates. Constantly updating well over 200-240MB and the cute non-explanations as to the content of those updates are getting old. Act like adults and disclose, thats a lot of data a$@holes"
YouTube is the life. This app is incredible
"DATA MINING APP. This app has new updates every 1 to 2 wells - to mine your data and build a profile of you for Google; sending your viewing information and searches back to their servers for profit and political profiling. Beware.Only update this app once a year - these updates do not improve the app. The updates are there to (in essence), spy on you"
Choosing video quality. I understand its 1 extra click but damn well know that higher quality equals more data usage. Choosing a video quality used to be clean and simple but now youve overcomplicated it. Please give us the option to simplify it if we understand how data usage works . If it aint broke dont fix it
Why. I turned off my data and  turned it back on it freaked out and now  I cant watch YouTube videos
Restricted Mode turned on forever. Im heavily disappointed by the new update because when Im not on the internet and using my cellular data it forces me back to restrict mode not making me watch my favorite YouTube videos please fix this problem or Ill never watch YouTube ever again Thank you
"Gets worse with every update. 10s of billions of dollars and access to more data than anyone else on earth somehow results in constant loss of features and mind boggling decisions, who takes away the dislike button? Absolute nonsense"
YouTube. I love YouTube.it lets me watch any youtubers that I want.and I dont have to go to safari and it taking up more internet/data
User experience. So many adds Im already paying for my data and now  you tube always trying to sell ads free monthly plans Its not affordable for me to buy
"Knowledge , information, must have saved me thousands of dollars. Great app"
"YouTube Review. Constant interruptions of commercials, from 2 to 3 at the beginning of videos, then 1 to 2 while videos are playing I rarely watch videos now, just Netflix or CraveI will not register what I watch because you dont have the right to breach my privacy"
I like watching genshin impact vids. Keep up the good work on updating YouTube and making things smoother but one thing I dont like is the mb storage space on YouTube app. It uses too much mb space. And I would like this to be optimize Thank you. Edit: also please make it have privacy protection

"An Incredible Resource. I started being amused by little bits that friends would send or direct me to. But I now realize that YouTube is an incredible, visual and vocal re-source for nearly anything that has ever been photographed or filmed or recorded"
It works well but it would put Some of my videos on private or wont post. Hello. Ive been having YouTube for a few years. But I have never seen anything like this happen to me I was about to post a video and then I just waited about a few minutes it still didnt post. Waiting for a few more.then I wonder why its taking so long. I do delete the upload. Then a hour later I want to post a video. Its does post but it puts on the video on private . I change the privacy but it says that there was an error with the video so I delete the upload and then I try to post it again still putting it on a private video. I dont know if its just a error but. Im not sure at all
Data-stealing app. It stole my WiFi Worst entertainment app ever
"Ad Central. Too many ads. All ads are crappy mobile game ads. They are all fake and very cringe, my personal favorite is the Chinese bootlegs. There is a lot of crappy gacha game ads"
Too many adverts I cant stand it much longer :(. To even put ads in the middle of music tracks now is the end Im afraid... can you be any more money grabbing YouTube? You front even pay for most of the content
"It could be better. It&#39;s a good app, but I could have perfect wifi/data and out of nowhere, the screen gets blurry or delayed during a video. Also, they have deleted views off videos of creators, such as BTS"
"The YouTube App is amazing. The app for YouTube is incredible, easy to work with and always fun to use"
Too many commercials and data hog. Too many commercials. Designed for city dwellers with strong internet. Rural residents are left out again and expected to pay ten times more for what city dwellers get for less
"Complete pain trying to download songs and create playlists without ads. When we are trying to sort things out for personal use without ads, the inability to this without the jaw-droppingly expensive (for the amount I need to do) subscription charges is mind-blowingly frustratingAds ads ads. Completely disruptive"
Too many ads. Two unskippable ads at the beginning two at the end. Im here to be entertained not watch crap I dont care for. Recommendations is stupid as it keeps putting crap videos and shorts into my feed and ones that do not relate to what I regularly watch
"Video Quality Options. I want to choose 480p as the default video quality for data usage, but I cant now with the stupid quality options that YouTube put, its the stupidest decision ever made, please change it youtube"
"Would Stop Using. Overall the app works great and I have no issues with it, my problem is with the company. Google tracks literally everything to create hyper-targeted ads, and shows far too many of them. Id stop using them if I could, but I cant find another platform thats as feature rich as this. Not to mention the new ad thing and the fact that I dont even know whose tube it is anymore, and it certainly isnt mine"
It won't allow me to log in to google. I can't login to my google account from my iphone13 pro. My saved preferences are all in my account which I cannot access
Porn advertising. Too many pornographic advertisements seriously affect personal physical health
Too much advertisement. Far too much advertisement. Making me watch 2 videos now just so someone is satisfied with whatever rubbish Im forced to watch and its a real disappointment so low rating from me but hey its all for money so have fun
Good but not great. YouTube has so many options but I like to watch soccer live and it usually shows just info about the game but I watched one game with YouTube and there are lots of different stuff but there also are too many adds and No one wants to pay for it but just please do not have adds in the middle of video and do not show comments on the screen and lastly make a kids channel version that is  private and can not be hacked . Overall It is fine Thanks
"Disruptive updates. The video quality options (auto, higher quality, and data saver) are totally useless. Sometimes the video starts at 144p with my 1Gb download internet, other times it sets to 1080p 60fps and loads for awhile. The server is also slow when other sites or speed tests show high speed low pins. Although the contents and personalized are great, there are too many fake news and false informations on the site. There are no differences between credible news outlet and conspiracy channels"
"18+ videos... . This is not specifically about the app, but having to enter your credit card details or some type of legal identification documentation just to watch a certain documentary or even something like a rock concert from back in the day, is an absolute disgrace. YouTube claim its a new law yet I know people who have had their accounts for years, have never entered any of this info thats apparently the law and they can watch everything perfectly fine. Ive been on YouTube for 10 years and now I cant watch some videos because of this nonsense and the only reason theyve done it is to data mine us. Not to mention the whole dislike button being removed which no one asked for and literally no one is happy that its gone either. A joke of a platform that is trying to censor everything and everyone. Shame on You(tube)"
"Oof. I always watch videos on YouTube and I love it But for the past couple days I cannot get on the app. It looks as if I dont have the service to, but I can access youtube through the browser. I need helpEdit: I must have just accidentally turned off the cell data on the app I fixed it thank goodness lol"
YouTube review. Very informative information on interesting topics I enjoy watching YouTube very much keep up the good work. JP
"YouTube review. I do enjoy YouTube and how they cater to my likes and dislikes, I also know that they need to make a living by selling adds but I dislike the long drawn out adds that steel my data. I would be more likely to buy from your advertisers if the adds were short and to the point"
YouTube. You need to get rid of a feature on YouTube when I watch YouTube on the YouTube app you need to get rid of the track position on YouTube it is really dumb I dont like it its really irritated when I have captions on reason I cant see my videos please get rid of it or bring a setting where you can enable it off so you dont have to have it on all the time if she certain users want to be able to use it get rid of track precision or bring a switch with the user can decide if they want it on or off please I cant see my captions on the tracks position is on please get rid of i immediately please get rid of the track position on on the YouTube app for iPhone I am asking please please its really irritated immediately
Amazing but. I love watching my favorite YouTubers such as flamingo I wish it didnt use WiFi because I go on a lot of car rides and sometimes data doesnt work I really want to be able to watch Youtube without WiFi -Approved By: Chelsey
Unable to use it through mobile data. Im unable to access YouTube contents using mobile data from my iPhone. But from WiFi I can browse it. Please fix this issue...Update (7-Apr-21): Bug not fixed. Even after recent update I&#39;m not able to watch youtube from my mobile data
"Stop pandering. This app is my favorite. I love YouTube but whatever is jacked up with their ads algorithms needs to be fixed. I hate woke, leftist, racist adds. Im a conservative but despite the obvious bias against my political affiliations, I still love the app. FIX YOUR ADD ALGORITHMS Im tired of seeing woke, racist, bigoted, or obvious leftist propaganda in my adds. For the love of god, you earn enough money to invest in developing your app to not make me sit through the torture of watching leftist propaganda when I know the data you collect from me is sufficient to inform you I dont want to see that crap"
"Great platform, terrible update. Aside from being a spectacular way to watch videos its slowly becoming a crappy app through trying to control the viewers and creators alike. Too many times have creators moved to another platform to avoid demonetization and harsh rules. The most recent  and visible update to me being the YouTube shorts (we arnt going to talk about how they essentially stole this off TikTok as far as I care) and the dislike button. Now what I care about most is the dislike button because that gives a collective voice to the viewers. It tells them weather or not somebody is a scammer, untrustworthy , giving false info etc.. I love YouTube but honestly with it cracking down on discord bots (sent cease and desist letter to the biggest 2 music bots) and ads becoming longer and selling our data I might actually switch to a different platform unless something changes"
"Good but needs improvement. The app performs some basic functions as expected but is lacking . The app never accurately keeps track of what you watched, how much you watched, and consistent across devices. It also seems like it is marginal when you are offline watching downloaded videos. Also its difficult to organize your playlists and tagged videos. Need to be able to globally manage them in addition to one-by-one"
You and what you are tracked. Have you seen the data that Google collects on you?Are you okay with that?Check out the data collection box below.I deleted it
Restricted. I love the app but one day my video restrictions turned on and now I cant watched restricted videos when Im on mobile data but when Im on WiFi I can of like to know why
"Dont bother if youre going to be this bad. I was watching a video, paused it and went on with my life,.... 6 hours later I wanted to watch the rest of the video, but it was nowhere to be found.I mean google,... seriously,.... just, you know stick to making phones with outdated hardware and leave me alone on iOS,.. I dont care about your feud with Apple, make things work,.. its free and the ads are bad enough as they are, at least give me some functionality"
Stop deleting organic views. Focus on correcting your data and stop mindlessly deleting views to adhere to your curve
"Picture in Picture. Only video service on my phone that doesnt support PiP. I get that supreme overlord google wants us to buy android phones but this is just poor app design. Dont you want your users to have the best experience possible?? This is why Ill never get a pixel, you dont care about user experience, you care about getting our data and selling it"
YouTube premium. The Premium is better than Netflix. You can watch totally whatever and download for trips or to save on WiFi data. Also get the Music thing for free that is comparable to Spotify
"I live on uTube. Its my main source for information. For those of you who say. Oh yea, you get your information off the internet. Its all BullWhat makes you think the main stream media is fact?Ive been around long enough to know most of it is fabricated and propaganda.Id rather use uTube and decide for myself what is and what isnt...I have to change my opinion. It seems now that google has it its controlled media. I cant believe how much has been taken off because it does not meet the communists party view. SorryuTube, there was a time you were great"
"Too many ad interruptions. This app has gone from good to bad in a few years. Every update the ad nuisance level goes up a notch. As does the prompting to pay to remove them. I would rather use my money to buy tracks from amazon or Apple than pay subscription. Google you already take our personal info, dont you make enough out of that? I am looking for another app"
"DATA MINING APP. This app has new updates every 1 to 2 wells - to mine your data and build a profile of you for Google; sending your viewing information and searches back to their servers for profit and political profiling. Beware.Only update this app once a year - these updates do not improve the app. The updates are there to (in essence), our in you"
For having bought YouTube Premium. Honestly for having $17 fee just to download music is really crappy I really like to play music when I dont have data or some thing and then I cant even do that still sometimes you have to be connected to Wi-Fi to play your downloaded music anyway in certain situationBut I do like YouTube so Ill give you three stars -TwTMB
Incredible. YouTube is the best way to watch videos. Just love creating videos  and it is a great way to have fun
"Clunky UX. Videos wont load all the way when they can, like you can actually do on browser, which makes it useless when using transports for example.Constantly spamming you to use the premium version, and locking some very basic features behind that paywall.The social aspect is not working well, as it doesnt notify you most of the time, and theres no find or history function to look at your previous comments for example; this considering the emphasis YT has put in this specific aspect.It constantly collects your data, if something that concerns you.Id suggest sticking to use the browser over the app on mobile, as it offers a better experience"
Take away restricted mode. I just downloaded the app and when I came to watch it it wont let me watch certain videos. And the app wont let me commit so I would like you to take it down and if we want it put it on the settings and let us decide if we want it or not
Problem. Watched a video now is on my HOME every timeIt shouldnt be like thisThere is no privacy
"Incredible App, few peeves though. I love youtube and ive been watching for as long as i can remember. I wish they brought back the old video rating system, star rating. I find it a lot more better than likes. Another issue my friends and I absolutely hate are double ads that you cant skip. Please remove this or I will delete youtube"
Greedy company. They really blocked Picture in Picture for all iOS 14 users just cause they wanted us to buy a terrible premium service when I can just go watch Netflix or Hulu and be easily more entertained and continuing using other apps on my phone at the same time. BTW I still dont have to watch ads on your website but now I cant watch them on my phone
Ads. I understand that you need to have ads but Its getting crazy an ad after every single songAnd after every single videoOn My personal opinion.This getting out of hand
"having trouble with the new update. this new update has really ruined my youtube experience. it wont even let me get into the app its says this app is no longer shared with you and i dont know how to fix it. i dont want to delete it and have all of my data not be saved. please if anyone else had this problem and was able to fix it, give me some advice"
Quality control. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SET DEFAULT VIDEO QUALITYnot everyone has unlimited data
Annoying popups. Stop trying to sell me on youtube red. I just want to watch my ads in peace
"Asking me for credit card info to download?. Asking me to enter credit card or payment information in order to download the app cant download otherwise. This wasnt the case before the update. Isnt YouTube a free app? All other free apps, none ask for this information before being able to download This is in direct contradiction to their privacy policy. As a free app, this should be downloadable without requesting from users personal information irrelevant to the free use of the app. Please fix"
Wayyy to many interruptions. Ads about my personal life
Awesome information available. It is like having the worlds biggest library of all information available in videos.  Anyone can access & understand what questions they need answered at anytime.  Awesome information available  Thanks to technology
"Bug filled and low content. Do not rely on the downloads section in almost any capacity.  Not only do you need active data to enter into your locally stored videos, but video timestamps (where you left off) do not upload with delay, downloaded video will auto delete if you reach maximum storage, and there is no way to access your list of previously downloaded videos.Stick to free YouTube theres almost no reason to pay for the most expensive subscription video service on the net"
Advert tracking. Im constantly seeing the same adverts over and over on this app. When you mark it as inappropriate it just keeps coming back. I have to use a vpn to stop the same ads appearing and there is no option in the app to stop this from happening
Restricted mode glitch literally stops me from watching videos. This app is good when it works but this new glitch where if Im using my data I get automatically switched to restricted is really annoying and basically stops me from watching anything and yes I have tried turning the settings off it doesnt work Ive deleted and reinstalled the app still does it and when I got to the support page I just get told to use a VPN so I did and now after a while of that working it is now doing it again no matter if I have a VPN on or not and its doing it when I use wifi now the fact that the literally support page only form of solution is to just have us fix it ourselves without them doing anything to fix it is absolutely ridiculous
Why did you break the app?. Since this last update the app doesnt actually close when you close it. I have had the app killed and run in background turned off yet Ive had 24hrs screen time on the YouTube app for 3 days in a row. My data is capped and I am charged when I go over. Thank you YouTube for wasting 30% of my data allotment for no reason. What a joke group of devs
"A Few Annoying Parts. Overall, I love YouTube, I use it everyday (especially with how the world is right now) but there are some flaws for mobile, for instance why did you split this &amp; studio into separate apps? You can edit videos privacy &amp; stuff on this app iirc, so why not just put studio inside of it? Other than that, Ive had a couple of annoying things where the audio bugs out/isnt synced with the video, but it still has a 4 star. Hoping that one day they put studio and this app into one"
"Nothing has changed, just a lousy app full of bugs. Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of commercials you are doing now and the incredible amount of money you are making by the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t get a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. The same bug that as been there for at least two to three years is still there. It keeps getting stuck when I try to post a comment. I need to close it and restart the app. It was doing better for a little bit, but the bug is just as bad now as it was before. Come on Google, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter"
YouTube . YouTube is incredible You can watch anything for your liking and there is people for all different ages
"Best app to watch off. Honestly everything everyone says is wrong. I mean there might be some changes needed but still you can watch for free no network payments needed and if you find someone you like or a whole bunch of people you can subscribe to them for free to, and all you need is a email. It is that simple, and you dont even need a email to watch and it is free to be a YouTuber"
I love YouTube. I really like you to because I have some of my favorite shows and its like so cool and theres like the show called spy ninjas I go on it every day theres theres like so many uploads music this like what I love about it is it because of a has like this week little TickTock thing its not really TickTock and I like to go on it and pretend Im on TickTock but Im actually not on TickTock and I just really like it because like its good for me to like watch him like sometimes I go on a walk at nine and I sometimes it acts up so I deleted the app and then I do and then Im gone and then I just go back on it but yeah this is like really cool this app thats why am reading it this app I am if you are Im getting this app you have to read it a five because it is awesome and
Amazing Just a little bug. Every time I try to upload a video its always private. I change it but it always says Error. Data could not be changed. I have no idea how to change it as well. Please fix this. Thanks for reading :D
Really???. Just look at this privacy label nightmare
"I have a small problem. So I made a video and posted it on my personal channel it was made 1 year ago, and when I went to watch it I couldnt find it because it restricted me from going down further in my own content to find it, and no matter how much I try I cant get to the video in my channel, I dont know if this makes sense but I would really like it if you could make the app to have a personalized playlist of your private videos, or something like that, other than that I have no complaints"
No privacy what soever. This is a spying  app. It will switch your camera on &amp; microphone without your permission i have tested this myself in a test centre. Stay away 
YouTube is the best. YouTube is incredible for me and my mom and my family I love it and I cant believe that I am so happy that I love your love your app 5 stars
"Little bit frustrating. Ive been going on YouTube for awhile now but all of a sudden when I click on it, it says that in order to open this app you need to download it like what?? So I went to the App Store and obviously it says open so I click on it and it says the same thing again... so I try to delete it but if I do all my data is gone so what do I do?"
"Finally deleted YouTube. Besides the excessive ads the last straw came with the new frame rate options.  Not really options unless you prefer to select every single video to set preferred frame rate.  Im on limited cell data, I can no longer preset videos or commercials frame rates. It no longer is a feasible for me"
I love YouTube. I love YouTube cause we can watch incredible videos and music
"Ads, ads, ads, & more Ads. Download this app if youre really into watching ads and occasionally watching something entertaining"
ads ads ads Enough already. Ever since I refused the free one month no ads app I have had two per three minute of watching YouTube. Never happened before Wont be watching YouTube now Bye
"Pay for premium and get this garbage. As the title says I pay for the premium, as my phone doesnt have a data plan so I have the music saved onto my phone that way. But as of lately, the YouTube app just sucks, its clearly not being maintained as every day around the same time and weekend around noon, it crashes, constantly...cant listen to music, cant watch any videos. I wouldnt even waste your time with this. Might as well go Spotify or some other music/home made video app...and maybe there will be a new site just like YouTube that will be just overall better.This App isnt worth clogging up your phones HDD"
". When I shut off cellar data for this app I expect Ed it would allow me to browse YouTube  Anonymously , but it seems as long as the app is install on iOS 13  on my phone I can no longer do this in.. Safari"
"Great resource and enjoyable viewing. I have found this site to be a vast knowledge of the fyi, dyi, shade tree candors eh watch with obvious caution on validity of information and techniques offered up. That being said there are a ton of fair to good non professional pages. Offering as youd expect the same as their knowledge limits them. Nothing wrong with, necessity being the mother of invention eh There are some sketchy dyirs. All in all fun to watch off grid, mechanics, hydro grow/ power systems hacks to construction how tos and living. Lets not forget the many professional sex medical counseling   pages. 1 glaring negative Many of these people in here make a living with their followers pages. Apparently the posts they put up can be hijacked by someone posting the blog and getting paid by the followers from original poster. Even if the original poster was warned and had the post income blocked by You Tube. Some very shady censorship going on here. It appears that jealousy can attack an original post with failure to follow site rules. Then steal income from the post as I mentioned earlier. Yet on the thiefs site are many of the same or worse violations eh Even stolen revenue reposted from other victimized bloggers eh"
"Please Help with Technical Issue. This morning, when I tried to put a video on, I found that my YouTube app was reporting a No Connection message at the bottom of my screen. I was confused because I was using the internet just fine on other apps. I tried every troubleshooting effort on my end. I cycled between WI-FI and mobile data. I restarted my phone. I reset my network settings. I uninstalled and reinstalled the YouTube app. No luck.The strange thing about the issue is that although YouTube wont will not allow me to play videos, it will still load search result and allow me to pull up videos that were not initially loaded on the Home Screen. It allows me to do everything but watch the videos. It is very frustrating. I am a YouTube Premium subscriber and it wont be worth having the subscription if I cannot use the app on my phone, my main platform for viewing YouTube.YouTube Developers, if you see this, please help. The only thing I can think of that changed overnight was my phone updated to IOS 15.3.1"
Privacy. Stop deleting my reviews
Restricted. It says Im restricted network administrator even though Im on my phone and using data it wont let me watch anyone fix this pls
"Doesnt work with Mobile data. YouTube hasnt been working for over 2 days with mobile data, very disappointing"
Spy update?. All this new update seems to have done is made it so google can connect with my home devices. Not a fan of that
Censorship. Shame it n you. Stop censorship and limiting access to information related to Palestine and crimes of the Israeli colonization
2021 YouTube so joke. Commercials app not worth to install. Stupid app dont use in car. You may have accident because of interrupting commercials about nonsense. This guys just want your data and money. Fthem
"You Tube. I like using You Tube app it helps me to access different  things, and get to information about various topics, as well as to stay informed about such  aspects as the news"
BRING BACK THE 67M VIEWS FOR BTS. STOP STEALING BTS ON MV VIEWS YOU DO THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE COMEBACK   WE DEMAND JUSTICE FOR OUR BOYS GIVE BACK OUR 67M VIEWS AND WE ARE NOT BOTS
"Need more control over cellular data. As it stands, cellular data is only low data (which looks barely legible), high data (which will blow through my monthly data cap) and auto (which selects based on the quality of signal, but blows through my cap anyway).  Need a limiter on the last option  Please"
"Attention for Mobile Data users. before latest update we could choose 144p and it would remember quality choice for further playing videos, and it was good when I am on Mobile Data and trying use minimal Data...now quality choice become generalized and Low Data category that automatically chooses quality setting for next video is 240p....give us advanced option for default to be possible for us to set lowest possible quality when we are trying to save"
I HATE THE NEW UPDATE. Ok so here is the thing I loved YouTube so muchYeah I said loved. Now I hate this new update. I dont care about kids privacy. Mostly all the videos I watch dont let me use the mini player. I like watching Beeltejuice content I enjoy the movie musical and series but. Since the show is for kids some content on it is for kids. I cant comment on videos anymore either because comments are turned off. I just hate the update I bet you are thinking She gave us two stars because of an update yeah pretty much Please change this. I used to love this app but now it just turned into a mess
"Too much infantile stuff on it and too much about celebrities. It needs more reality. It needs more reality,,not dream world stuff. I liked my old you tube presentations, these are just too ...silly. And Im too ld for most cartoon shows which theres way too much of that on this selected board. It also seems to be well slanted to the leftist lib view of life which Id drop in a minute if I could. I want honesty and honest proofs of real reports, not a subjective run down of everything political too. I do like to see both sides of a story if there is such if only two views of news or life stories are available. Also,,dont like the signing over personal info to be able to post comments inside the stories"
Steals views. This app has something against bts THEY ALWAYS DELETE VIEWS FROM THEIR HARD WORKING SWEATS LIKE OMFGGG super bad app
"Rubbish. Keeps offering me some free trial - dont want it and dont need it, just leave me alone. I only go there to watch an occasional video and thats it. Stop trying to sell me things there. Adverts are ridiculous too, it sometimes shows 3 in a row just to watch a short clip. Cant watch a video peacefully these days. Just shut it down and make lives better for people"
You Tube is not only for You...its Everybody Tube. The variety of. The variety of programs is a magnet for everybody at home: from my two-years-old grand daughter that walks around the house with her moms phone watching the kidss shows learning the alphabet songs and the numbers to the adults like me watching old movies or my son watching Telemundos El Seńor de los Cielos
"3 years and counting & nothing has changed, just a lousy. The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing A LOT when trying to post a comment. Specially on longer commands. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of ads you are forcing people to watch and the incredible amount of money you are making from the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t put together a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. SERIOUSLY How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
"Problems come with premium. I have used YouTube since 2009, when I was almost 11 years old. I love it I recently had a small percentage of my personal budget open up for more entertainment options and I bought premium Ever since, I have had trouble with videos going full black screen. Not every time, but occasionally, I cannot watch videos I previously started without losing all options for video picture. For the price of two Spotify accounts I guess I expected more? Im thinking I need to to stop my subscription and open a new google affiliated email? Anyways, YouTube is great but their in app purchases might need work, in 2022. Regardless, this is a great app for ANYONE"
"Great app However. This app is really good, but I dont like that if you now click on someones profile, you can see all their comments made and all the other things like recent comments. To me it sort of destroys the privacy that I wish to have. Thank you"
Just scroll through the privacy report. Ouch
Removed dislike button. Now people are using bots to spam likes on their videos and the dislikes cant be seen to actually judge how good the video is. Without open criticism it causes false information to spread easily
"YouTube. Used to be the best app, but now no background playing except if you pay also ads every single play....again forcing you pay...really lost the first position between the apps...ruined an incredible app"
A terrible app. App exists only to glean personal data with no payback whatsoever in usefulness or functionality. Delete the app and use a browser window instead if you want to watch user content 
Quality control. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SET DEFAULT VIDEO QUALITYIm tired of clicking 360p at the start of EVERY video.not everyone has unlimited data
"1080p buffering with iPhone app data. Please allow YouTube iPhone mobile app to force play 1080p when on mobile data service. It used to play 1080p when I play music on YouTube mobile app to my car wirelessly. Now the most is 720p, 1080p would keep buffering"
Love YouTube. I love this app cuz its so cool and it really helps you keep track of ur self and helps you realize some things

"It works well on iPadOS 13.5.1 but would like to its integration with Today View. Like the ability to delete and/or pause both the search history and the watch history, even when having to google/YouTube account. Some privacy, however token it may be, is still better than none"
"Im never getting premium. Too many prompts for YouTube premium. Also videos should not drain all your phone data. Its 2020, lets make it easy on our plans. Sometimes we just wanna listen to a song, and a without watching a video, or if were not on wifi, a non HD, low quality video would suffice. Just thoughts. Also hire me. YouTube makes a killing and I need a steady job. Thanks"
Constantly malfunctioning. Always finds a way to delete views from videos. Is always glitching and has many videos with sensitive content. Also invade@privacy and steal information. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP AT ALL
"Bring back selecting video quality manually. This whole auto, higher picture quality, and data saver is trash. Bring back letting someone select what resolution they want to watch at"
"Fishing to home project information. Being an avid fisherman and homeowner, You Tube videos have become an indispensable source of information for me. I use the videos for knowledge on selecting fishing gear and lures and using effective fishing techniques in different situations. Has really made my fishing game much more productive and enjoyable. Likewise, videos have helped me greatly with all sorts of handyman projects, including plumbing repairs and lawn tractor repair and maintenance. So helpful and entertaining, the videos have become an intricate part of my everyday life"

"I Love YouTube. YouTube has provided me an outlet for my channel SteveInvests to help others with personal finance, real estate and financial freedom. It has also been an incredible resource to learn"
"Good but need improvement. Urs very good app compared to others1. It still throws irrelevant ads to the video. For example, for children videos it brings adult adds 2. It still brings the ads which were given feedback with3. Search results are not newer ones, instead of showing the recent results it shows 5 year old data"
Great but needs a Little something. This app is incredible I love it so much but I think when you press home you should be able to have a tiny little screen where you can watch YouTube wow going on a different app I have to keep deleting YouTube and watching on safari then I have to get we get YouTube its getting very annoying please add this feature
"Who needs cable. You tube has transformed my business, personal life, and home life.  Its a total game changer.   Thank u"
Ah mazing. YouTube music and videos have helped me to create dynamic and impactful lessons both for my sports teams and my students.  Thank you for the multitude of learning videos and also fora platform onto which I can upload videos for personal and private viewing
"No WiFi, no videos. My 4G is incredible. I always have exceptional service. I cant use my YouTube app unless Im connected to WiFi, even when I have full service. It tells me to connect to the internet. Pretty lame"
Ads... and no window to window mode. Ads None stop. Just eating away my unlimited Data
2020 and still cant run in the background. You sell your users data for billions. Stop jerking us around and give us features we actually want
YouTube is incredible. YouTube is a fun app and a lot of entertainment and I think who ever made this app did a great job
Observation. Algorithms for personal preferences can be improved
Helpful application. Enjoy watching every kind of information and entertainmenteverything is there
"Useful, Entertaining, Educational. Youtube brings so much helpful information to my phone.  I can learn new sewing techniques, gardening skills, or fix an appliance.  I can subscribe to a favorite content provider and receive an alert when they publish a new video to watch.  I especially enjoy subscribing to publishers all over the world:  cooking videos from Korea, a specialist in Australia who grows succulents, a gardener in Argentina.  Many offer subtitles in Your native language.   I also enjoy reading the comments left by viewers because that can be a wealth of information too.  So much to see and enjoy"
"The ads have gone too far, not to mention the atrocious collection of data. No idea why on earth this app has such a high star rating but its become absolutely atrocious. And you wonder why many of us resort to using ad blockers on desktop. Also bring back the dislike count dumbasses"

Unable to use it through mobile data. Im unable to access YouTube contents using mobile data from my iPhone. But from WiFi I can browse it. Please fix this issue
"Review. Content Options are incredible, however, the constant intrusive advertising brings the app down to mediocre"
The best video watching app. Its the best app for watching video but the problem is they your data on what you watch and sell your information to third parties
"Appreciation. I appreciate the amount of valuable information that you can get from this app and that choices of who to watch regarding controversial subjects like government, health , vaccines , Monsanto , Gates and COVID-19 are left to the subscriberI also appreciate the creativity from YouTubers...... product info ,CRAFTERS ,etc . Very well rounded app"
"IM IN AN OBVIOUS FILTER BUBBLE/DATA VOID/ECHO CHAMBER. I am not finding any more information that I might disagree with, is intriguing or is otherwise interesting. I am noticing that all my search results only match closely whatever Ive seen before. Thus turns me off from searching YouTube anymore for learning something new or experiencing opposing viewpoints.  Id much rather any other less profiling platform.  And if I see another Grammarly commercial Ill go insane"
"Why. Your app upadates too many time and the loading,ill have four bars but apparently no internet and there is too many adds premium is too expensive.And the data seems like it doesnt work on youtube"
Ehhh..no. Dont delete views. Lying about data is not cool. The actual app itself though is alright
"Poor connection. I have been encountering sudden disconnection from Youtube very often either using Wi-Fi or data.  I tested my other devices and my internet connection, they ran well on other apps.  Please fix the issues. Thank you"
AMAZING but. This soo incredible and its the only website I go on besides social media. I have a YouTube channel and subscribe to many people. Except. I went to change my profile picture then I got my picture and cropped it the way I wanted it and pressed save but it didnt do anything. Please fix it I want to change my profile picture. It doesnt let me press save or even cancel. PLEASE FIX IT
Should be better by now. Should have a way to maxillary quality when on WiFi and set to a diff quality while on data. Really that complicated?
Flaws. I love YouTube but when I switched phones aka I bought a new one.Once I transferred all my stuff from my old phone to the new one all my watch history was wiped out clean.I wish there was a way to recover this data.There has been quite a few updates and I hope this will make it in because I really need to get all that data back
"What is going on???. Cant connect to YouTube with any device, wifi or data wise??? Come on folks, some people depend on your services for disabled people Edit: second day in a row: no connectivity in the morning. Sad"
I love YouTube. I love you too because there is a lot of videos and its very fun to watch and it also gives you information if you need some
Video quality settings update made app unusable. I loved YouTube and the app up until the update that changes the video resolution play back. I have limited data and I am unable to move to a larger plan. It was important that I could set a resolution for a video manually and when I went to a new video it wouldnt change the resolution on me. In data saving mode it still defaults to 1080p and by the time I change the quality down on each video it has already used a significant amount of my download. This has reduced the amount of content that I can watch each month hours and I am unable to use the app now
"Not allowing HD videos to upload through mobile data. YouTube is good, but it doesnt allow me to upload HD videos through my mobile data asking for WiFi to be connectedApril 22,2020 reviewFrequently crashing a lot"
"Uhh. So I&#39;ve been useing youtube sense I was 9-10 and now with the new update it just... Won&#39;t lode anything? My wifi is full bars as well my data, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s me"
"Honestly, kinda good. I think this app is amazing You get to pick what you watch and stuff. But Im here to tell you something: Why. Are. Random. Things. On. My. Recommendeds? Some stuff I watch and its there but than other RaNdOm stuff pops up like Among us hacks and Zoom meeting people, I honestly dont know why"
"Stupid Chromecast issue. When you cast to Chromecast, you cant watch youtube anymore, sometimes my daughter wants to watch cartoons and if I cast it to TV then I cant watch anything else, its so stupidly done, even if I disconnect and close youtube, and continue on LTE, as soon as I will enable wifi to not waste data plan, it closes my video and reconnects to Chromecast, why? Who did it? Whoever Ive asked about it, they hate when this happens, I have to go grab macbook and cast something from mac to make sure iPhones YouTube app is not casting anything to use as needed. Also When you stream from MacOS or Windows or whatever, browser version of youtube cant continue auto play next video, Im 100% sure that Google staff never uses Chromecast and thats why it has so many bugs and stupid issues"
Dont have kids. Didnt ask for your crap Dont have kids. Never will. What gives you right to invade my privacy. Send one more &amp; youll be reported as spam So bugger off  Bad enough you cant even provide a phone number you scamming cows
Spycakes is best. It lets me watch YouTube whenever I want and I can watch my favorite channel spycakes which is great even incredible
"Pause screen takes up too much space and other problems. This update isnt great. The chromecast layout now looks like Google tv but the two function differently as one needs a remote while the other functions directly through the phone app. The pause screen is awkward and takes up an incredible amount of visual space for no reason - I dont need to see thumbnails of the ones Ive already watched/have queued. This pause screen also takes too long to go when pressing play, obscuring the actual video.The Home Screen is irritating, it used to be neutral and now its some version of the trending page. I  this is because of a decline in people checking out the"
"Why?. Why is recent comment on this channel showing up. I want my privacy, I dont want what I type on comment to be showed to others"
"Better User Interface Please. Would love a better user interface for creating lists, cleaning up subscription lists, removing extraneous data .....more streamlined workflow/accessibility and efficient user interface"
"About ads. The app is great, and its been great for the few past years and everything But my problem is the ads for this year in 2021, not all of us go outside, some have online school and some dont. When I finish school work I like to watch tv, and the problem is is theres a lot of 2 ads with no skip and theres a lot, I mean A LOT of 2 ads I wish there was just one and sometimes 2 like it used to be but the ads are becoming a problem to me, its just a personal complaint about the ads for me, I think. I really think you should lessen the ads per video, sometimes Im watching a movie and theres about 20 ads in 10 minutes I really dislike that"
"The ads are getting ridiculous. Seriously multiple ads before, during, and after every video.. No wonder I stopped watching videos on there. I got on today for the first time in a while and it&#39;s just crazy how many ads there are. I refuse to try and watch something if there&#39;s more advertisements than content on there"
Ads. The ads is using internet from mobile data. I am simply not paying for ads. Its not on Remove the ads please
Good app but why track so much of my stuff. Ok?
People also watched. Get rid of people also watched and stop adding more irritating features uggghhh
The Good the bad and the why. The good is easy to use and fast the bad is take your information the why is it so fun
"Forced update. I cant believe yall forced me to update to the newest version. I had been on that version for 4 years. This new version doesnt run good on my iPhone 7 and I hate the changes. I havent upgraded my iPhone specifically because I use YouTube so much and hated the new version. Thats how much I hate the newest update, that I would rather have an 4 year old iPhone. I hate your company. Ill never give yall a single dollar if I can help it. I know yall will still make money selling my data anyway though so. I wish yall had a serious competitor. But I guess this comment is just going to get lost in this sea of five-star bots"

I love YouTube but I hate how I need WiFi for the app. Can you make YouTube work offline without premium or cellular data?

Stop censoring. Stop censoring real conversation and real data about adverse effects of covid 19 vaccine  You are quickly going from one of the most awesome sites ever created to just another controlling main stream media site  If your platform is to not spread misinformation about the vaccine than sooner or later when all of the real data is compiled over the next few years you will then be censoring pro-vax as if it is bad info Because the data is overwhelming  Im so glad that I dont pay for your service and I never will
0 privacy. April 8th 2018 at 12:46pm was probably the funniest thing thats ever happened at YouTube
Add something new. Love the app everything smooth and easy to understand BUT will you PLEASE add a function where u can keep playing the videos on lock screen on your phone  It gets super frustrating when u have it in your pocket and it goes to next track or pauses Plz add that
"YouTube. I love YouTube, I watch YouTube every day, and I cant stop watching the spy ninjas Because they are so awesome"
"Its not fair. Its not fair that after all the work our fandom has made our views are eliminated. We work hard everyday to put our artist in the spot for our views to be taken like that. We work hard our artist work hard everyday. A view is a view no matter what and it took data plan, effort and time. So we need our views back. #youtubepleaserespondwewantourviewsback"
"Great. I love this app, it makes it so much easier to watch videos and see my favorite YouTubers.. however, whenever I close the app to do something really quick (usually less than a minute) I come back and my video is gone. This really annoys me because it loses my search to so I might not be able to track it back down again. (This is kinda a personal problem but still wanna say so if your here for the app you dont have to read the following) YouTube is really addictive. I will watch one video and think about an activity that I have to do but continue to watch video after video after video. In a way this is a complement but it still bothers me a lot in my day to day life.  otherwise its a great app and the few weeks I didnt have it was like torture The website is a lot harder, but only if you havent gotten the app and see how easy it is on the app"
Very current with information. I dont have to watch TV. Everything is on YouTube. From back to back and current info YouTube have it all
Youtube. Seriously. YouTube quit with the HEY REVIEW US every time I try to watch a 30 second YouTube video. You already sell my information to China what more do you want?
When you download a video. When downloading a video it really helps you specially if you will go on a travel and do not have any datas but... When you download it it can only reaches up to 140(p) and its really low quality
"Ads ads ads. The amount of ads and their length is completely out of control. This is especially true if youre listening to a podcast or long video or music. I was even listening to an hour long video while out cleaning my garage and 3-10 minute ads kept coming up. Also if youre listening to a music playlist, it reduces the volume on each new track which makes it useless for music streaming"
"You. All you want to see and watch. Be entertained, educated, enlightened and interact with communities  perfect for you. And bad for you  its pretty incredible"
"Too many ads. Stupid ads that dont relate to me. Track me more, big tech. Really get inside my brain"
"Great App, Restrictive new update. Can you please give us back the flexibility to set video streaming quality to 240p? I am a big fan of the new video quality settings but the lowest quality were allowed is 360p (Data saver). 240p is just fine, it is quite annoying having to manually set to 240p on every video i watch. Thanks"
"Connection. The YouTube app wont work on my cellular data, it only works on WiFi. Please fix this issue"
"Internet compatibility issue. Almost everyday for a year now on my iphone xs max if im watching youtube via wifi I will get videos that infinitely load until I disconnect and reconnect or switch to data. No it is not a wifi issue because I watch both amazon video and hulu on the same phone without a single issue. No other app in fact has issues when using wifi besides youtube for me. Been waiting all year for one of these updates to fix it and apparently it isnt going to be fixed, very frustrating"
Under YouTube short it doesn't show I tune important videos at all. Under YouTube short it doesn&#39;t show I tune important videos at all Even if the privacy option is all open it&#39;s still the issue fixed as fast because this is unacceptable
"The ads have gone too far, not to mention the atrocious collection of data. No idea why on earth this app has such a high star rating but its become absolutely atrocious. And you wonder why many of us resort to using ad blockers on desktop. Im also now using alternatives to the native app on mobile to bypass these stupid ads"
Doesn't Follow Ad Tracking Transparency Rules. This app still serves ads even when not allowing App Tracking to the app
"BRING BACK DISLIKE COUNT. Were not stupid, we know why you removed and what youre covering up. However, Im sick and tired of not knowing if a video is spam or a useless tutorial. Itd be nice to know what I watch before I watch as a consumer. Like reading reviews on an app before you download, right now thousands of One Stars are being for this app because theyre being stupid"
"Download. All my downloads were gone after update,is not the cloud used for keeping data for this reason"
Why selling subscription?. Is you tube free to watch or not??
The Algorithm needs to be re-looked. There has been some issues with when you watch a video that you like on your account and want to watch later on but when to re-watch the video it would mostly say This video is Private or This video is no longer available Can you please look into this a lot of our biggest you tubers had been forced to leave the platform because of the conditions that had been recently changed
Sick of the ads. Non stop in your face ads. If you don&#39;t allow it to track you it&#39;s just republican/GOP/Trump ads non stop full of false information. You&#39;d assume based on these ads America is under assault from all non white countries who are sending their prisoners across the border to rape and pillage. It&#39;s beyond annoying
"God Sent. You can learn just about anything on YouTube, isnt that enough for 5 stars right there? If you pay monthly, you can watch any video with no ads, I only pay 15.99 a month, completely worth it, best easy to access learning center, my personal favorite app"
"Really hope theres a new online steaming video platform out there. Ads are way too much and too long. Used to be no ads, than one ads now two ads in a roll that cant be skipped. Lot of mobile data are going into the ads"
"F off. Stop asking me to verify my account every other week  I know you want to track and sell my data, but I dont appreciate this hassle  Garbage company with 0 way to give feedback or voice displeasure other than this"
"Invasion of Privacy. i dont have your Ap. Yet, while I was trying to make a work related email, you interrupted my screen 5 times over 20 minutes with an Ad. I will never ever subscribe to you service thanks to this invasion of my privacy. I dont see how its legal for you to do this"
"Poor YouTube. Its streams ads with breeze...but when the video youre actually watching starts, the video would keep buffering for no reason.Seems like they have started prioritizing data for ads rather than the actual video"
"Nice free with ads. I like how Utube is developing, seems fair. The free with ads synced up well, with how I manage much of my online time  and activity. Ive a Secure feeling with my data, my ads are ok, sometimes good. Go utube"
Shit app. this shit app always steals our tiredness and freeze the viewers and streaming gor itself ..really we all will report it if it doesn&#39;t sotp freezing the views..is not fair and logical. if it doesn&#39;t stop we will file an invitation because it is theft for their personal interests
"Deleting this app, YTP spam is now unbearable. This app was fine, until today...A recent stealth update has caused YouTube to spam me endless undisableable Premium notifications every minute or so when it used to do it like once in a couple of weeks.I dont care if lose the ability to watch 60 FPS videos on my phone, I cant take anymore of this notification spam.I hate YT Premium and I DONT want it, go away YTP Let us disable all YTP notifications, please"
Youtube. The only problem i have is the fact that it burns through ur data quickly
Fix the Library pls. So when i remove a video from the library while Im still watching it when i leave from the chain of videos i watched it remembers and it puts me at the point i stopped watching it. What Im trying to say is when i removed a video from the library it was such a good way to hide what i was watching from others. Think about privacy mmkay? Mainly this only works for videos the library shows at a beginning or midway. This doesnt happen for ones where the point shows at the end. Think u can make it always show at the end of the vid or for at anytime i stopped watching it always start from the beginning once i removed it? Thx
Download and updata. I&#39;m no longer to use YouTube b/c it is out of data on this iPad
"Poor algorithms. Channels I keep checking the I have NO interest in button keep appearing on my recommended. Whereas channels I wish to see ON my feed and even ring the bell for them to appear on my recommended section also I fail to receive notifications from such channels.  I feel like my viewing isn&#39;t honored and that the algorithm is messing with data and not accurately showing recommendations based on my views, likes, and history. I kindly ask that you fix current problems with the algorithm. Im not one to write reviews or read them, but from the reviews I read before ultimately deciding to write my own, it seems Im not alone with being disappointed in the current runnings of YouTube.  Thank you"
Video quality on mobile data. The option to pick specific quality on mobile data has been removed for no reason if your data can handle higher qualitys you should be able to pick them
"Great app, spam for premium unwelcome. This app never stops trying to sell you a subscription. Ads in videos are enough, the premium subscription spam is too much"
"A one time favorite. I do value the capitalist nature of our country however, to see a mega corporation such as this one, greedily placing so many ads in videos as if the billions they are making isnt enough, it is appalling. The first decent competitor to come along will have my business and my ever so valuable meta data"
Making an Account. It is hard to make an account off of a different email. I had to use a school email but I wanted to have a username and not have my personal name and email floating around during a live stream or when I comment on a video
App does not play. Youtube app is full of bugs and shares your personal info
This app listens to your conversations. Listens to your conversations even when your phone is locked. Also displays the worst content over and over despite my attempts at hiding them and refreshing
Any context you can find. I enjoy watching YouTube. Listening to music. Watching sports and blogs old and new. Current and old news spread from all around the world. Just amazing and incredible content I can find in YouTube. I highly recommend YouTube
"3 years & nothing has changed, just a lousy. The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing occasionally when trying to post a comment. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of commercials you are doing now and the incredible amount of money you are making by the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t get a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly.How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
"who runs this thing?. As such, in principle, You Tube is a fantastic idea and it is truly astonishing that a person can access so much info, in word and in pictures at a touch of screen.However, the search system leaves A LOT to be desired, it seems extremely chaotic and rarely gives me to the point, reasonably recent and enough of finds relevant to what I am looking for.Al in all, I spend way too much time getting to what I want"
"Good but. Like the many videos but the app needs improvement. Search history, watch history, and viewed content (full and partial) is not updated properly on any one device and not across my different devices. The app also does not seem to operate properly when I get disconnected or go offline. I can watch downloads but the viewing bar will not get updated when I get back on line. I just want a seamless experience where everything gets updates quickly across all devices. I switch a lot between environments and devices. But there is a lot of good video content coming on line but also a lot of people who put up low quality content to just get views and ad revenue. Thats why I want to keep track of what I search for, and watch. Many times a video I  realized I was watching that I previously determined not worthy but YouTube did not show my that I partially watched it. I would to organize playlists the same across all devices, and change the order and priority. So I would rate it 4.5 but because of the app updating I need to rate it 3.0 because I waste too much time. But the app overall is still powerful and has many good features so its not all bad"
"Funny how the updates stopped. Used to be a update nearly every other day, now Apple has introduced privacy ratings on apps and the developers have to submit them to get an app published the updates have stopped, one can only assume the app is being completely rewritten to strip out all the spyware erm I mean analytics "
E. I love YouTube but today I found out the data stuff (documents) took up 6gb Thats more than 30x the actual app size Please tell me another way to fix that without redownloading the app
"Whatever they did with this update, it ruined it. I pay for premium and now most of the time my screen is black and even downloaded videos act like they cant play, as though the data connected is bad. Please fix this, I love YouTube"
"Watch Later Limit. Get rid of the Watch Later limit of 5,000 videos"
Wont work w out WiFi. My data is fine I can only use the app through WiFi tried reaching out to YouTube really sick of this app anybody want to help since YouTube employees are useless
Bring back the thumbs down data. I hate the new video scoring policy. Bring back the thumbs down data
Removals. I can decide for myself if I want to see or read items for myself. Do not censure information
You tube spy corrupted shady company. They blocked reviews watch out  They spy on you
Just a review. I hate the auto quality and the new place for the comments its very hard to forget where the comment section used to be and i dont like the new update something is going wrong the data is max and it wont do the video  update ads are barely skippable on phones
"Pretty good but still falls short. Love the app, watching videos everyday, even just leaving videos on and listening to them as I do other things. I have Premium so I dont run into ads and it works great.However, I hate the recent updates that put videos from the same channel into playlists as a new video is added, the list gets changed. I want to watch specific videos and not rewatch something I already watched. Furthermore, still havent seem to fix the crashing issue with downloaded videos. Whenever a video is downloaded and a crash occurs, the Downloads no longer appear but the data remains so Ill end up with a bunch of space used by YouTube that I cant clear without uninstalling the app completely.Hopefully the app gets updated and the notifications go back to what it used to be and more fixes are rolled out"
Garbage update. Latest update for tv (mid aug 2020) is full of bugs and appears has never been tested... Unacceptable. It wipes away multi user account data and does not retain it after adding. In addition they have added more forced ads. Good job
"YouTube Music subscription. I pay a monthly fee to enjoy listening to music as free, my gripe is this; there is the ability to add songs to personal playlists and yet after adding tracks to various playlists the next time I revisit a particular playlist dozens of songs have been removed. I find this more than irritating. The music is available and yet these tracks are constantly removed. I feel like the subscription is a total waste of time because of this. If it continues I shall have no choice but to promptly cease the subscription. Honestly Its a damned rip off"
"You Tube review. I enjoy YouTube more than anything I watch. If I am repairing something I dont know about I get information here. Anything I want to learn about I look here first. A lot of music I like comes from here. I am a car nut, watch a lot of racing, car building, towing, anything that is odd that I never knew about. I search for new information constantly"
"Annoying. The app seems to intentionally making it hard to use and annoying so that you will consider paying for premium just to stop the frustration.  It does this first by not letting the videos to be watched Picture-in-Picture in the background. Then it makes closing a video fully from full screen a challenge taking multiple taps on small icons in different places to close, which if you dont do a post video ad rolls. With all the valuable data they already collect from a persons viewing habits this is annoying and frustrating"
"THE NEW COMMENTS SECTION IS AWFUL. Terrible absolutely TERRIBLE Im going to just use my pc for YouTube from now on plus I get ad blocker and I can use team viewer to stream YouTube from my pc so I get the benefit of ad block, I can no longer set video quality it does whatever it wants, I used to be able set to set it to 144p and it would stay on 144p all day so it wont burn my data at work well unfortunately now its constantly changing to 360p or 480 or anything higher, they fixed what wasnt broken, they need to have a setting to where tou can specifically pick the quality you want, in the YouTube settings you can only choose 360p as the lowest, this is terrible and its glitchy and it needs to be changed and fixed"
"Bookmarks. You outta introduce a bookmark system of some kind so people can keep track of stuff. There are a lot of reasons I use the website instead of the app, but being able to bookmark videos, playlists, and creator&#39;s pages is probably the main reason. You just can&#39;t find anything in the app"
Odd bug. So when i watch a video every like 6 months it takes me to where all my apps are so I try open YouTube but its downloading something and I need to delete the app to make it work but I lose all my data
"YouTube. When the update was updating, it is not updating although it is basically frozen but nearly updated Pls fix that YouTube, I am angry about that, because I could possibly lose data, and my channel"
"Best app ever. Its the best place to watch videos and you can download your favorite videos to watch it with no internet like if your on a trip and its a long way to go. Just pull out your phone, laptop, tablet, it works on any device. Just download YouTube if you havent already"
"10 and 9 year old review (Cecilia and Clara). YouTube is great. We like to watch crafts and comment. In this review we want to talk about COPPA. (Childrens Online Protection Privacy Action)Ok. So COPPA is ok. For kids videos, COPPA turns off comments, which is PERFECTLY fine. Also live chat. Which we understand. Small kids cant talk with strangers.But COPPA is going too far. With kids videos, you cant put watermarks, you cant save to playlists, you cant even do mini player. COPPA is crazy. We hate yo COPPA. You r the worst. Stop making kids videos so silly. I hate u. Also update YouTube Kids App YouTube kids is sooooooo SOOOOOOOO SOOOO SOSOOBDISHDHDDNSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOOOOOOOOOOOSOSOSOSODJCJEODNDINDJDJJSJEKWJEGEOWHEJBEOEHEENEJEH babyish. There are silly noises and silly sound that are extremely annoying. We are tweens both and we HATE IT. WE WANT YOUTUBE YOUTUBE YOUTUBE YOUTUBE BYE"
"Changing apps. Idk why app develops and software developers feel the need to overhaul their design every so often so it completely changes the way the app works. Are you guys at risk for losing your jobs so you just keep coming up with 50 ways to do the same thing? Is there data that said this is a good idea? I think its horrible that developers keep making its users figure out how to use their apps and software over and over again. Certain things shouldnt be changed, the comment section being one of them. How about you work on the crappy recommendations or the fact that the recommendations are radicalizing political ideologies, quickly with misinformation. Smh just disappointed"
". I cant change from wifi -only to use data to download that very annoying , get rip of your app"
"So. Many. Ads. So so many ads. Ridiculous numbers of ads. Are you trying to become network tv? Youve got them beat in number of ads. Are you trying to push your premium service? This is not the way to do it. I realize youre a business and not a public service, but you already had ads.  You also track, collect and I assume sell user data. Does that not pay enough?I wonder how Vimeo is coming along.  They couldnt have more ads. ."
Bring back choosing specific resolutions. Stop treating people like idiots who dont know they can easily just change to a lower resolution to save data. My videos run perfect at 1080p but at the highest possible resolution it now decides to go higher than that and make the video buffer annoyingly. Bring back the old way and let us just choose the resolutions we want videos to be played at
"What happened?. YouTube in itself is fine but something happened recently and I dont know why. I had been watching YouTube all day and all of the sudden the app deleted a YEARS worth of history, data, and all of the playlists I created. I didnt do anything to do this and I dont understand why it happened. It also deleted all of my subscriptions. Im not sure if I was hacked or something or when the app updated something went wrong but I didnt enjoy that experience. If it can be fixed I would be happy if you could, buy if not its ok. Thanks"
"A formerly good platform made unbearable by ads. Once the best platform for video information, made unbearable by ads. Looong ads that dont relate to me. If I must watch something Im now turning the volume all the way down and not watching, but waiting out the very long ads. Such a shame"
Deleting views. I think its not okay to delete views from a video. The BTSArmy is known for their incredible power. Just because no other fandom has done this before and the views are crashing everything PLUS break records doesnt mean they can get deleted. I hope they will fix that and stop deleting views cause its so obvious? We admire them so thats why we are streaming..they deserve it
"Ads Galore. So much ads. I come here to watch some anime clips, not to watch an oversized bird sell me car insurance. 0 stars if I could"
"Recommendations. If I wanted to see the content getting recommended to me I would look it up. I shouldn&#39;t have to go through each one and click &#39;not interested&#39; for you to understand. I was doing just fine with the related videos, but I could really do without your stupid recommendation algorithm. It&#39;s trash, take it out. I keep getting recommendations for videos I have already watched... why?? Why would I want to watch them a second time "
"Your list. Saving videos and organizing the list is not easyPlease provide a list nesting option like we have in Note, Spotify and other apps. I have now 50 playlist to scroll. Please option to merge playlists.Please a clear indicator in my list item if this lit is public or private. I dont want to click each to find out. Please option to save the Kids content to playlist. Switching to Kids app is not an option.//////////Algorithm Please provide a simple view on how the algorithm data is optimized for each individual user. I want to know how is the content prioritized and an easy way to reprioritize the algorithm"
"iPad app really leaves a lot to be desired. As a paid Premium subscriber, Im pretty unhappy with how bad the iPad app is, and should probably cancel my subscription and resort to other services for blocking ads and downloading videos. First of all, the app doesnt support Picture in Picture, while even a basic YouTube video embedded in a web page will usually allow that option. Also, there are hardly any keyboard shortcuts that work in the app compared to the ones you can use with YouTubes browser based player. Downloading lots of videos in the app turned it into an extremely sluggish beast, and clicking on the options to delete a download would make the app freeze for 10-20 seconds before letting you delete the video (this is not acceptable when you have tons of videos you want to delete). The ability to select multiple items, or at the very least implementing a swipe to delete feature would behove the developers. Admittedly, I did have over 1700 videos downloaded at one point, which I probably would never have watched all of, but this is on a new iPad Pro with tons of storage and I expect better performance. It got to the point where the whole app was so unbelieveably slow and unusable that I deleted the whole app and all my downloads with it, and never looked back"
To restrictive. I used to enjoy UTube but now with all the censorship I dont bother with it much I can make my own decisions on whatever the issue is not have a certain agenda pushed as if we have a choice  My point - you cant say anything that goes against an unelected who with legit info But we are forced to hear from some CPU guy
my favorite app. I love Youtube I get great ideas and information from watching YouTube its been a life saver for me
I dont know what I would do without this. Literally every day I watch this if you dont think this is good you just dont like watching videos. BEST APP EVER DOWNLOAD
"Stole our views. 70 million views were stolen from the new music video by bts, we would understand if it were few million views but 70 seriously, give us the data and paper work that this 70 million views were fake than we will accept it"
Unbelievable four a big company. I understand having ads to pay the bills. I know you data mine which helps pay the bills. I for the life of me cannot understand why I cannot multitask while using your app. If I use your app then I have to keep it open at all times which makes no sense. I listen to music but not with you for this reason
Amazing. YouTube is revolutionary it is free and i love all the peeps on here such as coyote Peterson on brave wilderness and Leah Ashe and the navalua fam and other people so amazing one thing though could you trycome up with a way to be able to watch YouTube without internet or celluar data thank you
"Recent updates = negative experience. Home does not load more than one item, which is an ad.Incredible amount of ads, especially political ads. Ive decreased my use of the app bc of this. Comments section is awful to scroll through now. The algorithm for suggested videos is amiss most of the time"
"Buggier every release. Gross data usage. My old negative review was deleatedThe good is very good. However, The irritating bugs get more plentiful each release - none fixed. It just amazes me. A couple of the gross ones:* No-Preview selector does not work. Previews are running automatically as I scroll, even though no-preview is selected. * Videos will automatically start and play for hours with no sound and not allow iPhone to autolock - later pick up the phone and see the video was playing silently on an unlocked phone using my cell data without permission. * REWIND IS GONE ON LIVE  REALLY?  That was the power .... the reason to watch live on youtube. I just need to switch to getting more news apps. Peel off one use at a time. * Already watched videos indicated as new release many times the same day. * Selections move as about to click, thus selecting wrong one. * I no longer watch youtube movies. Other movie streamers use a lot less data with far far greater quality* I like the independent channels - but really, youtube is the only game in town for now"
"Cellular Data is Broken. Whenever Im using my data YouTube channels dont show up when I search for them, just videos. And when I watch most videos from my search history and on the recommended page, everything underneath, recommended videos, titles, descriptions, view count, comments, link to the channel, even the like and dislike buttons are all gone. I can get to channels from clicking on the icon on the video thumbnails but most of the videos are unavailable. I can only watch them from my history and they have all the issues stated above"
"Quit censoring conservatives. You tube has shown us in 2020 without a doubt they are nothing more than a propaganda arm for the democrats by constantly censoring speech, videos, news and any other form of communication from conservatives Shame on you You are total sells outs If your tired of these criminals hiding the other side of the story then switch to rumble. They dont censor either side regardless of their personal political opinions. Boycott everything left who tries to silence opposing views. The people have a right to hear all sides and to be allowed to formulate their own opinions. Socialism and communism censors - not free America"
"Censorship. You Tube censors whatever doesnt fit their agenda  And Im not talking about pornography, violence or drugs, Im talking about speeches or stories from people like Trump or Dan Bongino, personal opinions & stories  regarding the vaccine and its side effects, and information from hundreds of doctors, vaccine specialists, immunologists, virologists sharing their knowledge and experiences regarding Covid and the vaccine. This is a violation of your first amendment rights  Choose Rumble or Bit Chute instead - they dont censor"
"This aint it. Okay so you delete over 72M views and expect to get support? Idk what you are doing over there but do you have a personal hatred against BTS? Bc Im so confused.... give an apology or at least respond, like the mature adults we all expect you to be.. Im getting Netflix this is too much :)"
"Tim pool, Troy crowder, etc. Keep them on here Im ok, dont? Im goneI hate big techbut give these guys a chance Im okthe second you dont Im done. Im not a minoritybe cool if you didnt track my datalike when I use a bathroom?  Thanksweirdos"
Please get rid of the last update or make the app have less data. I cant update YtIm a small youtuber so this is making me panicPlease make the app smaller so I can update it
not truthful. real views are not being counted for videos. personal view history gets deleted without user knowledge
"Incredible. This thing is the best. It is pretty awesome that it has awesome things to watch and Im 2 subscribers I love to learn in it,and there is plenty of things students can learn. The best thing about it is...WATCHING I had mostly used this app in my life and it was awesome I mostly use this app to watch for about 4 years. I think all kids need to use this app to learn and have fun. If all kids used this app and gave it 5 or 4 stars I will be amazed.that is my opinion about YouTube. My subscribers are cookieswirlc,honeyheartc,and mostly the gaming beaver. That is why I think this is the best app in my life(Well The first one is snake rival but this is the 2nd one That is mine about this amazing and incredible app.By: Joyce"
" 5 Star. Love YouTube for its unlimited variety of options to choose from; meditation, personal development, home Renos, how-to, entertainment, etc. Its a plethora of video information that anyone can likely find what they are in search of"
One little Idea but the rest IS THE BEST. Best App EVER I have one problem though it doesnt work with mobile data it would be really cool when you can download a Video while you have Internet and then You can watch it later for example you see ah I think this Video looks cool but oh dear I have to drive to the middle of no wheat in 10 minutes where I have no Internet then you can hit a little button on the side witch downloads the video to maybe next to the search button so you can watch it later that would be pretty cool and so you can also find it easier later
Stealing views. You guys took over 80 mil views on bts new song stay good and are promoting blackpink I mean go off black pink but its wrong to steal views absolutely wrong
"Made to be too child friendly. I have to say it is a very good and enjoyable app to watch videos, its just way too much with having everything be child friendly, many people have many incredible ideas and other stuff they could have done and enjoyed but because it has to be child friendly it ruins it, and I dont think anyone would want the app to be just for kids, and kids can really ruin stuff, and it hurts the channels that are necessary on the money they get from their videos"
"Stop asking me to sign up for premium and just make it the app. You are the standard for videos on the internet, stop trying to take a subscription fee from me too. Youve been tracking and selling my data for more than a decade, be happy with your monopoly and let me watch my videos in peace"
"I Love it, But. I love this service. I think it is great and I have all positives for it. However, even though this service is amazing already, the only thing left that would make it absolutely perfect is if it had the option for google home to play your personal library music. For example if I ask my google home to play one of my playlists, it picks a playlist that has a similar name to mine, but is a different playlist from my personal playlist. Could you please add that feature? With that then that would be perfect"
YouTube please fix this. So I gave this app 3 stars because of the fact that recently I would have 3 bars of WiFi or 5G data and I cannot play videos in 180p60 quality. Sometimes if the app is good to me I can play videos in 720p60 quality. Another thing I dislike about the app is that the videos freeze very often. Please fix this youtube
Constantly asking to upgrade. Constantly asking to up grade to monthly subscription additional services. A lot of these services were once available for free and removed only to be added at a price. Just kinda lame behavior. It seems unnecessary. Make money of adds and selling our data like the rest of the soulless corporations
"100% DOWNLOAD IT. I love this app so much. It is just so amazing. I mostly come here for entertainment but sometimes hacks. It&#39;s just mind blowing how much stuff u can find on here The only issue is with the restrictions. One example is that a good video was on here and it wasn&#39;t really that inappropriate,(it was restricted) then there was this music video with cuss words galore, nudity, just bad stuff all together and it wasn&#39;t age restricted at all. I feel like anytime a little child could see that and say the things in that video. It&#39;s not really that bad I just wanted to point that out. But otherwise I love this app sooooo much. It&#39;s just amazing how you can do so many cool vids and upload them. And I still to this day have a hobby of making YouTube vids. (I&#39;ve been uploading for about 2 years now) I just love it overall, this is the best app I&#39;ve ever EVER download Anyways if y&#39;all read my review have an amazing day and definitely download this app"
"Uninstalled. As a medical professional I find it deeply disturbing that a media platform is making judgement calls in what is considered science.  Furthermore, the video that was removed was not only accurate, it mirrors the data in other winter tourist destinations, specifically Florida.  Sad that YouTube feels the need to continue the fear mongering"
"Needing to log in. My nine year old wants to make playlists, also to be able to re watch his watched videos. However as a parent i dont want him commenting on videos or people being able to message him (also he clearly has no email address)   Why not allow DEVICES to create Playlists, have a watch history without Logging in ?Show the world your not greedy for personal information and open up bare basic browser kinda history without the need for an email and a youtube account ?"
Very Informative. Very convenient with access to a vast amount of valuable information
"Boooo. Im pretty darn good with computers as far as being self taught; not great but pretty good. But I could not get over not being able to figure out how to watch the movie I purchased I mean does it have to be so bloody hard? After an hour of reading and searching and reading I figured out I have an account that is not personal (cant remember the term used). HOW I got that I dont have a clue other than some of my personal travel videos, not intended for public but was uploaded (I guess) as not private turned me into a non-personal account?? Dont know.Anyway, Google it Right? WrongEvery explanation to try and change from (what ever the term is) back to personal failed. I never did get to see the movie.Big thumbs down YouTubeLets see if it matters enough to YouTube to help me sort it out with out me having to delete my account and loose all my (personal) videos"
Hate new video quality setting . I hate the new video quality settings with no direct resolution change Its making me bust my cell data plan
"Get your app out of my way of watching things. Every time I use your iOS app I leave frustrated after watching one thing... Get your 3+ interactions to close a video, constant suggestions for watching content I havent subscribed to when Ive got other videos I have subscribed to, non working rewind button, relentless notification pushing your paid version, horrible UX app out of my way of enjoying the content that keeps your lights on"
Sell outs . Dont like the advertising . This place used to be unique in the way that u could watch videos on command. Now its become just like t.v... annoying commercials up the wazoo. The main reason why I dont watch t.v anymore
"Good app but a mic on glitch thats creepy. Okay, good app and all, but earlier today I clicked live just to see if it works for me or not, which it doesnt and Im fine with, yet a few minutes ago I noticed that every time I clicked off of YouTube for like 2-3 seconds my mic was on. As if I was in a call or a video or something. Then itd turn off. This kinda freaks me out because its as if YouTube is recording me outside the app for a second. I dont know about you, but I like my privacy, and if that mic is on, thats scary. Like I could be pooping while watching a vid or so and I wouldnt even know that mic was on (Cause lets be honest, at least once in your life youve played on your phone/iPad while using the restroom at home) Ill bet that nobody would want something to record them without permission. Thats just creepy and invasion of privacy ;-; (now yeah I did try to turn on live, but it doesnt let me, so why is it turning on the mic when its not supposed to?)"
"Excellent. I use this app daily and I love the solid performance and features. Growing up with only having 5 channels on local TV to watch and a wired telephone, technology has become such an incredible addition to our daily lives, and this is just one of many apps that I enjoy for entertainment. Thank you to YouTube and to all of the content creators"
Why do you need to be fancy. I know that your updates are good but this is strait up stupid and why do you need to choose data saver or auto or other things just revert back the way it should be
"Terrible Site now. Removed dislike button, continue to push politics and skewering data on videos to hide dislike for them. They also do not seem to care about actual creators and are choosing corporations instead"
Too many commercials. YouTube is horrible since they sold out. If I see a Commerical I refuse to buy that product
"Liberal Dictators. YouTube, Apple, Twitter, FB, WhatsAppCensoring, No freedom of speech, collecting data, infringement on privacy, dictatorship, cancel culture, etc  Hitlers"
"Need improvements. Need Picture in picture with in the app for premium. I m tired of using the browser every time I want to watch something and do other things on the phone. Also I noticed the app uses cellular data even after switching youtube off from the cellular data settings. And please bring back the normal quality settings in videos, I dont want to click advance every time I want to watch on highest quality"
Service. Slow pausing during movies on YouTube and some time takes hours just to play movies the network server is something wrong connection to network tower the pass 3 months the service was slow cutting out and apps taking hours to loaded this why any networks will have the same problems in the future we can lose improvement information regard app which reliable data services thank you mr Daniel singh
"Cant disable previews. YouTube is great and all but I cant disable video previews on home which is SO ANNOYING I hate these things they eat so much data please fix YouTube, and every time I switch apps on my phone for even a second and go back to YouTube it completely resets"
"Stop asking for local network access permission. Stop asking for local network access permissionIt is not needed for AirPlay streaming, so you are forcing people to give you unnecessary permissionsStop sniffing for personal data"
App isnt working after update. Updates YouTube app as per request and its taken my data off and refusing to recognise me and I have no access to the premium account I am paying for. No issues until I updated earlier today and now I cant use it at all. Bet i will still be charged the subscription fee though
Best app. I love this app so much has so much inspiration I didnt make you learn and think whoever made this app they are incredible you should be proud of yourself for making these amazing videos and stuff these YouTubers are put onto your app because they teach people the age that you want them to be lots more things keep thinking keep smart and dont give up
YouTube is really good. You should be really. Really good because you can. Watch video when youre bored  when you get to watch  Gacha life yammy and. Spy ninjas Rebecca   Matt slays Rebeccas and Matt and all other YouTubes you can make videos
2021 YouTube so joke. Stupid app dont use in car. You may have accident because of interrupting commercials about nonsense. This guys just want your data and money. Fthem stupid app
YouTube is Amazing . I can find anything I need and it tracks what Ive been watching so I dont have to keep searching things up it entertains me and I love watching videos posted keep up the terrific work YouTube
Hacked. I question the professionalism of the description of the update information because it is very unprofessional. Cat videos?Drank to much Coffee?Exploring the universe ?Over and over on each update.Validity of updates because description is totally off the wall. 04/26/2021App hack?
Just for your information. Well Its a great app love but I live in a place where the internet is bad so could it maybe not use soooooo much internet
I like YouTube. I like YouTube because I watch it a lot because I like to watch it when Im bird or tired it Macks me feel happy when I watch it it is one of my favorites because Im 23and you should check it out it is incredible try it out it well have adds if you want there are free trails and it in Thea me to try something new when I watch YouTube  it feels like Im watching my favorite show like fuller house it has fifteenth YouTube chants so go. Check it out
new ui is a mess. first of all keep the &#34;low data mode&#34; on 480p have you ever watched any video on 360p before making that nonsense decision?why iam able to setup a custom quality for each video but there is no option to set a custom value for every video?u want to save the customers data ratio.. get rid of a 100ads to a 10min video.still missing the option to turn of cc by default
Bring back the dislike button. The whole point of the dislike and like button was to show your own personal approval of a video. Now I feel like I have no ability to interact with a video. Especially if comments are typically disabled. With no dislike button how can people warn others of content that might not match the title? Videos that arent appropriate etc. Completely silly to remove it
"Best place to watch videos ever. This my personal favorite app to watch videos,even when its offline"
"Rewind 15 seconds/ impossibly tiny controls. I cant believe the poor design aspects of YouTube that have not been corrected by now. Not a nice GUI experience, definitely not user friendly.1) Why isnt there a 15 second fast forward/rewind function.2) Why is the info box just a teeny tiny arrow. Do you realize how many people dont know how to access the vital information they are looking for. 3) Why are all of the control cons so ridiculously small. You should watch someone with large hands or sight issues use YouTube"
"Same junk, different day. 12/14/2020: I&#39;ve been using this junk for about 3 hours now, in those three hours of watching videos and commenting, I&#39;ve had to close and restart the app 11 times. 10 times after posting comments and once just looking at the suggestions after a watched a video. Yup, this up in amazing....ly bad More like junk  12/12/20: Some old problem of the app freezing. Specially if I stop watching a video, start a typing a commend, and then go to another app and come back to finish my commend. Sometimes I don&#39;t even have to leave, I start typing, change my mind, and then try to exit the commend box, it gets stuck in there. I was told at Apple that there is nothing wrong with my iPad Pro. May be it&#39;s an older model iPad Pro and YouTube trying to focus on news devices with faster ships and more memory. Too bad because at Apple I was told that people don&#39;t upgrade tablets as often as they do their phones. None the less, this app is lousy and the direct result of the lack of competition as YT forced Apple to pretty much band other developer&#39;s YT apps. Before there used to be a lot of apps for iPhones and iPads. Now we are stuck with a junk app that can&#39;t perform. I wish there were more options. Well there is, a couple of my friends have gone entirely off from YT, they even closed their account. Nice . 11/26/2020: It has been a few month since this got got really bad. It has been bad for a couple of years, but now it nothing but trash. I want to start keeping a record of dates. Just to see if Google decides to fix the problem. So as of today, no change to the app or Developers just sitting on their rear ends.-Installed the latest update, and still freezes. ---Hey Google, how about you fire the lead developer and get someone in there that can dk the job? The app keeps freezing, specially after posting a commend. Sometimes I am going to post a comment and cancel it and it freezes as well. Come on, don&#39;5 you people already make a killing from the incredible number of ads and gathering and sales of our personal information? Put some money you make off of us to good use and FIX THE LOUSY APP -The same bug that as been there for at least three years is still there. The app did OK for about a month, I was surprised. But with the latest update it is really bad and it is the worst I&#39;ve seen in a long time.It keeps freezing A LOT when trying to post a comment. Specially on longer commands. The little wheel on the right keeps spinning and spinning and it stays there forever. Can&#39;t move the screen up or down, change videos, nothing. Frozen in time forever.  When that happens I need to close it and restart the app.Seriously Google, with all the money from the bombardment of ads you are forcing people to watch and the incredible amount of money you are making from the collection and sales of people&#39;s personal information, and you can&#39;t put together a half was decent app to watch videos that works properly. SERIOUSLY How about this, use some of the money to make from our personal information and do something good with it, not just making your bank accounts fatter.Whoever is in charge of the app development needs to be given the boot and someone else who can get the job done hired"
For someone reason even when using my data and WiFi YouTube videos wont load for some reason. Can you guys fix this soon? I havent been able to watch videos at all
"Bug. I love this app everyone loves this app everyone knows this app but however when I try to post I video it just automatically turns private and Ive tried to make it public but it just said failed saving data so need you to fix that if you can :) sorry if I made you feel bad Ps, I make animations and subscribe to Lovely Sophia"
. This app...Oh this fricking app...after stealing my money when I clicked the free YouTube premium trial it crashes and deletes every single video I downloaded..not to mention that the individual membership is overpriced for just a month. This app just bothers me improve this and maybe Ill reconsider giving it more stars

YouTube has a malfunction?. Whenever I tried to watch you tube this morning it was working great but then I got home and its not working at all my wifi is on my cellular data is on everything is on but it just doesnt work anyone have an answer to whats going on
"Uhh... Heres something wrong. So I've been useing youtube sense I was 9-10 and now with the new update it just... Won't lode anything? My wifi is full bars as well my data, so I don't think it's me. But, it is a really good app.4 stars"
Good idea but heavily censored. They are not a free speech platform.  They censor anything that doesnt tow the line of the Leftist narrative. Data and science doesnt matter
"Great, One lil Complaint. So, I have been wanting to become a gachatuber for a long time, I mean, I have always watched them, thats all I really do on my free time. Anyway, I had made myself a channel and everything, made an entire glmm to publish to YT, when I tried to upload it YouTube said, failed beacause you have exceeded your quota. I looked up what that meant and they said it meant you just upload to many things or there is too much data on your account it whatever, but I havent uploaded anything At all Anyway, if this is a bug, pls fix it, I would really love to upload but your app wont let me. Thank you for reading this, pls fix it soon or even pls just tell me how to fix it if its something I did.Sincerely,A frustrated user"
"STOP. STOP: BLOCKING ~ MONITORING ~ DEMONETIZING ~ SPYING ~ REMOVING ~ HIDING / PLACEMENT CONTROLS ~ SUBSTITUTING ~ &amp; COMMUNISTIC BABYSITTINGThank You,VERY SINCERELY, Deborah Butler"
Information. Its amazing the info that is available. I use it quite often and find it very informative and helpful. A lot of the information is very interesting and enjoyable. Thanks for the format and details
Favourite app. My personal favourite app I just wish there were less ads
Invasive. You need to know how much information for me to watch a video? No thanks Google
"LOCK SCREEN OPTİON İS A MUST. A lock screen option is a must since İ give my phone to my baby after playing something for him. But he keeps tapping the screen and ends up closing the app or stopping the track. So please, Lock Screen is a must"
"EC. News papers give out miss information, there are lots of good sources of information on YouTube.Watch some interesting topics, also watch music eg Overdrive duo.Bob"
"The top App of Apps. Use this for everything, for learning for information and entertainment, excellent"
"Horrible update; Qanon propaganda tool; Privacy buster. New update is terrible, have to swipe to right everytime  you want to save (Ive never created anything so you put that button in the middle) and then after you go to description and press and timestamp a window pops up in the right.  Fix what aint broke.  Theyre also a Qanon/ righting propaganda tool still and the company (owned by google) is terrible.  NEVER PAUSE your subscription as they will charge you"
A great app overall. It is glitchy sometimes but overall a great app  the recommended page annoys me sometimes with the stuff it wants me to watch and it always plugs ads that I have recently talked about or searched which is an invasion of my privacy
YouTube is great but the app glitches. Im a fan of YouTube and watch videos on this platform more than I watch television but the app always glitches on my iPad Pro. I regularly have to delete the app and download it again just to get a picture
Lo mejor de internet. Me encanta en lo personal esta aplicación ya que tiene demasiada información sobre muchos temas ya es elección de uno cuál ver gracias por dejar a personas de compartir sus conocimientos y estilos de vida
Cost money just to download. Why is it making me enter my credit card information just to watch videos Absolutely ridiculous
My go to for entertainment and information. Use  You Tube daily
Not happy. Thats cost many data and not for poor people
Bug needs fixed but love it. I have been using YouTube since 2013 or 2012 and I just found a bug when I open the app it says connect to internet when I am using it I update it and the same turned my phone off and turned my Cellular Data off and back on and the same please make a update so this is fixed this is a really big problem
Resolution change. Just noticed that YouTube has made it more cumbersome to reduce resolution which I do to help save data useage on mobile. Move not appreciated
Good. Everyone had already used YouTube but if your downloading for whatever reason then its absolutely incredible
RESTRICTED MODE. It keeps going on and off of restricted mode even though I use my personal gmail with no administrators attached wtffffffff???
"Purchased videos. I have had constant problems trying to play videos I purchased with my personal to play on other devices as I teach from various PCs, iPads, laptops, etc...I expect that I should be able to have access to items Ive purchased on any device at anytime and not have the hassle of getting a notification that states I need to be signed in to a G Suite which is under a work account. No way of reaching a customer service representative that I know of"
All. I dont have Facebook but enjoy watching at youtube and make some comments. And get some info and great idea and innovations
"Video quality settings. I want to control my videos quality manually, I dont want to control based on how much data its consumed"
"Too many non-videos in feed. There are soo many ads, stories, surveys, pictures, etc in my feed that scrolling through to find something watch is mentally taxing.  I find it tiring to filter out the extra noise on screen.  I usually give up before finding something to watch"
"YouTube Rocks. Prior to the Corona Virus outbreak YouTube was my #1 Source, My One Stop Choice, my Prime tool for gathering Information on just about EVERYTHING From gathering news events on the latest Discoveries by The Hubble Telescope or ANYTHING Cosmos, Galactic or Interstellar related to learning how to prepare Chinese Food to viewing Puppy videos, to learning of remote villages in The Amazon to getting a glimpse of strides and new development in the Automotive/ Civilian Aircraft Manufacturing World.......... YouTube Covers it ALL . THANK YOU YouTube, I Truly Appreciate your Coverage & Content . You are an INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION, disseminating education to the Masses. Thanks again, Marcian Galanis"
Videos buffer but the ads play fine. Annoying on WiFi or using data
Utube review. I enjoy most of your platform.  There is more information that is useful.  Where you can improve.  I use to see more movies.  Private concerns now charge to see movies that should be free.  Television news from fox are too short and feature just a fraction of the news./  then they shut down. I use to watch the entire show  This is the most frustrating limitation when clarification is soon important.  I want to see all of it
Youtube Is The Best. I really enjoy listening to music on this app and watch gaming etc. The thing that makes this app amazing is just how theres so much content to watch or make. Its just incredible. Therefore I am rating this app 5 stars. :)

STOP STEALING BTS VIEWS. this app is terrible they keep stealing BTS views add the views back cause ARMYs are mad STOP stealing their views this app is the absolute worst
Trash. Oversteps the mark asking users for ID/ credit card info to verify your age. The Apple store would already have this info so this is google collecting more data without justification. Scum
It is really good. I watched Rebecca Zamolo and its so good you should download it andPeople are sending bad reviews idk why AND I HATE IT cuz thats how I learnt to play Roblox because I watch the spy ninjas and they kept on playing Roblox and I thought I wanted to play Roblox to so I downloaded it and without YouTube I wouldve never known that that was actually Roblox SO never send a bad review it is so good Who ever created thisTheyAre so cool at it I never knew they could make something like this its like so cool you know how to download apps and stuff because YouTubers play and you can get to make your own YouTubeIf you are on YouTube you are the best if you have a YouTube channel Im sure youll get more subscribers than ever anyone like 100B I LOVE IT you are the best YouTube
"My comments are not posted/my videos do not download. Many of my comments that are of a positive nature do not get posted. I called one YouTube channel to see if they marked my comments as spam. They didn&#39;t. They said they hadn&#39;t received my comments on their end. This means some of my comments are being blocked. The comments being blocked are not offensive, negative, or contains any false propaganda. The comments blocked are ones that I share personal information and positive attributes regarding my life. I tried to contact YouTube about this but was denied any and all acesses to their help center with a live technition. The only way one is able to email YouTube and have technical support is if they have a partnership channel with YouTube. This means only YouTube participants that have a massive followership.A new problem has surfaced. My videos that I want to download don&#39;t download even though I have sufficient data storage and coverage.New problem: my YouTube channel on my IPAD doesn&#39;t access videos from other YouTube channels. I can only access YouTube upload videos from other YouTube channels by my smartphone. My IPAD doesn&#39;t show any uploads"
Give us our views back. BTS deserved the views and you deleted 60 million and froze them. We almost broke our record but you refused to unfreeze
"Update is horrible. My youtube app used to be great and work well. The update that came out 3 days ago though changed that completely. I cant pull up a single video. The app loads but when I pull a video up I get the something went wrong message. My Netflix and Hulu work perfectly so its not my connection but I still tried turning off my WiFi to use my data and still nothing. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing, I even shut my phone down for a few minutes to reboot and it still wont work I will gladly update my review when this is fixed but for now I am beyond frustrated "
"Wells of information. All kinds of information is being provided right on time for those who know how to use.learn, get informed, inspired.... depends on my need. Grateful"
"Disappointed . Sometimes when Im seeing ads, it doesnt match my personal info, but when I check my personality, new advertising factors turn on automatically. And dont even think about turning it back on after 90 days. This bug or purpose should stop"
Fix the bug. YouTube is great but there is something wrong.whenever I go to YouTube.it erase my data/memory.pls fix that
Reason. The main reason I dont like this app is because we have to do dumb age restrictions  and there is so many videos I like and I cant watch and I dont want to give personal information to anyone who doesnt know me
Too many ads. Get rid of these ads...slowed down on watching because of it
"Complete pain trying to download songs and create playlists without ads. When we are trying to sort things out for personal use without ads, the inability to this without the jaw-droppingly expensive (for the amount I need to do) subscription charges is mind-blowingly frustrating"
"Daniel. The app is always buggy and the bugs never get fixed. Im sure a lot of people have their analytics turned on, but you probably only want it on to collect more of our data"
"Too many ads, dislike button doesnt work properly. My title sums up my thoughts quite nicely, Il be doing a repair on a car or something, only need 30 seconds or so of video to see where a particular bolt is, but I have to watch at least two unskippable adverts  extremely irritating, especially with poor mobile data in my area"
Forcing me to add phone number. Ive been using YouTube on my iPad for a good while. Only today I get a message when trying to sign in that it doesnt recognise my device and needs my mobile number. Get f****d Google. Im not surrendering more of my personal data to your data mining operationI also tried to tried to sign in by getting a verification sent to my email but its telling me my legitimate Gmail email address is not a valid email. WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS????
"Best Streaming App out there. This app allows you to watch anything. From ski tutorials to giving away 1,000,000 dollars. The app knows what you want to watch and has an incredible Tiktok like shorts page. If you have parents that dont like TikTok then just get YouTube and its essentially the same thing. Highly recommend this app probably the best one on my phone"
"Does not work anymore. Older versions used to work on iPad, but since the beginning of march 2022, account login and data access is broken.  Please correct this, otherwise a lot of users cannot use their devices anymore for watching YouTube Sometimes less is a lot better, than improving into oblivion and cutting off large user numbers"
"Zero star rating sadly not possible. If you enjoy censorship, constant adds, and being tracked and spied on constantly you might enjoy YouTube"
"The new update on automatically quality options. Now the quality is always at high settings and I have to change it to the lowest quality every time afterwards I watch a video, before you can just choose your quality and it will keep itself for the next video and when Im driving I usually listen too music and set the quality to lowest so I can saved up data but now I cant even listened music without have to go back to quality options which is dangerous when Im driving and have to clicked the option every time a new music I listen with out it being a high HD 720p60 and I did go to the options and choose the data saver but it will only saved 360p and not 144p or minimum 240p so I can save up data"
"Spyware. Take a look at the privacy sheet in the App Store, hope your finger doesnt fall asleep from all the scrolling to get to the end of the list of data this app collects"
Data usage settings do not work. Burnt through 10 GB of data in a couple hours on mobile data while my settings are set for data saver on mobile and high quality on wifi. The app keeps trying to go to 1080p when it is marked on data saver. Fix your app
Jaspuwu. My friend Jaspuwu uses this small app and I thought it was going to be buggy and glitchy but it turns out the small internet company google has managed to do something slightly productive for once even if they are selling my data to the Chinese
News. I like to watch world news and technology news as well on my own time and on my own peace Also I like to see different opinions from different people that are not leaning to any political nor economical side  They announce all what they see and a personal level and noting else
Eh. Im not liking the video quality changes I liked to change the video quality manually instead of having to go to settings and have it say to change to always have best of data saver please go backPlease I dont like the new changes of video quality put it back to where it was before the new update
"Things you should add. Make it where you can upload videos like on PC (if possible)1440p, &amp; 4K 60 FPS. Smoother experience, Better cellular data connection (If possible)Other wise a great app, I use this app everyday on my phone. "
G Suite flaw. This app was good until it started telling me I needed a G Suite account to watch its videos. I use my personal account and not my school account
Great viewing tube. Tube has everything for me at 67 and everything I let my granddaughter at 10 watch. The greatest thing I can say is its still free to use. Once it costs to view UTube Ill have to give it up. The data costs enough but its gold in my house. Cheers

"I hate this app. Stop manipulating data and deleting views please, thanks"
Perfect Partner. I am always count on YouTube to have great info and just what I want to watch
A bug need to be fixed. There is a thing pissing me off Its when you try to set the video public or unlisted but it says Error Saving Data. PLEASE FIX IT I MEAN IT Also mean idiots of youtube if all times are YMP She didnt add me in her school girls simulator YouTuber introduction video when Im one of them
"Leftist propaganda mouth piece. It would be nice if it actually allowed free and open thoughts instead of hiding and masking information.  The entire model needs to be shut down,  broken up, sold off"
"Finding new channels. Im finding it increasingly difficult to find new channels to watch, any suggested videos are mainly of people who I already watch, nothing new. Its getting so boring Im sick of only being given big channels to watch and people who Im already subscribed to. Give me new accounts, smaller accounts and stuff Im interested in. You have enough of my data to give me targeted ads, use that to give me a better viewing experience"
Why. Why did you have to add the whole continue watching this isnt Netflix we dont need that
"they are stealing my data. yes that sounds crazy,but i believe that da baby is behind this, i believe he is the one controlling everything going on in our heads, we are all being controlled by the lets gooo ha .there for we should alll start rap battleing eminem for the heavy weight championship of the rap game,that is how we will fight back against da baby and all his mind games. #dababyforlife #iheartdababy #makedababygreatagain #letssgoo #tinhats"
Stop playing games. Can yall please just make it so Im always watching content in the highest quality? Like a box I can click or something? Im so tired of the app just deciding what resolution it thinks Id like; if its available in 4K and I have bandwidth to support it then display it in 4K. This system is not saving anyone data or money its just annoying
"More and More Ads. A 31 second video should not have a 15 second unskippable ad with another ad after that. The amount of 3 consecutive ads in a row are ridiculous. The number unskippable ads are insane. The fact that even the shortest ads are 7 seconds long now are stupid. Its gotten to the point where unless Im on my computer with adblocker I wont even open YouTube, theres no point. The moment I see an unskippable ad on a short video, or get 3 ads in a row I close the app. Theres just no point. I didnt think you could do it, but you made me rather watch nothing that use your app. Incredible"
"Trash. Ad walls, data theft, terrible casting. Trash"
"Total Immersion in Information. This is the place to go to either escape or improve your daily life. The information presented is quite simply a virtual library of the wonderment of being a human being. From the arts, to the greatest life hacks, to anything you can imagine, this is the place.Thanks to every You-Tuber, good and bad, that takes the time to put their hearts and souls into their endeavors. I appreciate every one of their efforts.I have laughed, cried, learned and spent many hours expanding my horizons sitting in my easy chair, on vacation, a boring airplane flight in a thousand places and always have been entertained or enlightened. Thanks You Tube"
stealing views. Deleted 98 million of our hard worked views on BTSs official video for ON. Instead of breaking the most views in 24 hours record we were robbed of 98 million views. This is a continuing occurrence during our comebacks and it continues to get worse and worse. fix it
Bad quality. I cant download videos without having a membership it means I have to give my personal info to do it
My personal experience. Too many adds that are completely irrelevant to the types of videos you search up on average
age restriction. the age restriction thing is ridiculous. i can legally join the army yet cant watch a video with a few cuss words in it without putting in my personal information which is unsafe
Fix the Library pls. So when i remove a video from the library while Im still watching it when i leave from the chain of videos i watched it remembers and it puts me at the point i stopped watching it. What Im trying to say is when i removed a video from the library it was such a good way to hide what i was watching from others. Think about privacy mmkay? Mainly this only works for videos the library shows at a beginning or midway. This doesnt happen for ones where the point shows at the end. Think u can make it always show at the end of the vid or for at anytime i stopped watching it always start from the beginning once i removed it? Thx NOW I HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM When i watch a video that i have on library in a chain it goes to the point where i stopped watching it the FIRST TIME and it remembers where i stopped NOW after i stop the chain. PLS FIX THIS ITS OBNOXIOUS P.S. i think its a good idea you go back to the version before this happened. Do u remember when u guys changed things causing this to happen? Hope u doI think it was 16.34 this happened. Maybe you can bring that set up and same coding back?
Wonderful. I love YouTube it provides me with up to date information on tons of people I love to watch
"A New experience A New Life. You are Very Helpful in helping me to FIX thing around my house and my vehicles. You help me because I am infirm and disabled and poor, but you keep it free I collect so much data in my that experience with Traumatic Brain Injury... that it is like I am being re-educated to a New and more intelligent life ThankYou YouTube Keep it free for the Homes Love,  Howard"
Okay okay get in to it (sarcasm btw ). I love this app I can watch all you tubers on there and even songs oh and love the fact that wen u want an account u have sign up and so much personal information that makes me uncomfortable and they could scan u 
Review. Like the content enjoying the information yes everything I watch is what I like Thx to your content. Thx
"Fix your app. I love YouTube , obviously. Its where I watch anything on . BUT , for the last 2 days the videos have been lagging &amp; just wont work. My wifi works well with literally everything else &amp; ive tried using my data too but it wont work"
"YouTube. Can you make turning off the are you still watching notification an option?? Its really annoying, thanks"
Please make this easy fix. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Give me the option to block the popups that the creator has inserted into the videoNothing kills my immersion into the content like a pop up every 3 seconds that I have to click out of. Ill be watching something a lose out on valuable data etc
This is ridiculous. Boi why&#39;d you guys turn off the mini player like bruh it&#39;s annoying ur updates are so crappy also how does turning off mini player track kids data that&#39;s just stupid
"Ads out of control. Anyone with basic pattern recognition can see an exponential increase in frequency. I get the deal with free versions of anything, but wheres the line. Data used on ads should be prorated and returned"
"Excellent Two notes. I use this every day, I love it. Great app, robust, reliable, intuitive, I love it. Please make it so I can access the notifications from any page again (it&#39;s annoying the way it is now, vs a month ago) The notifications don&#39;t get updated across platforms. I check my notifications on my computer, and they are still there on my phone (unchecked) and vice versa. Also, when I close out a notification (or click one) from my lock screen, it should remove the bubble alert on the app (because I&#39;ve already seen it)"
"What a joke. An incredible amount of commercials now.  YouTube is infested with commercials  Terrible, corny, or just outright junk product selling.  No human support.  Every month youtube offers me a free month of premium.  Whenever I try the free month I get charged within two days.  Ask for a refund....Which I get but they also cancel the free month of premium I was offered"
"None. This new update on the video quality selection, could you get any dummer, or maybe I shouldnt ask that... put it pack so you can chose the actual quality, Ive got unlimited data and Im always on WiFi, but my videos are never in the highest quality... EVER?"
Constant suggestions for previously watched videos. The app is constantly showing videos I have already seen. There have been times that it only shows videos that have been previously watched. This is an issue that needs to be addressed immediately. Some videos I am not sure I have seen until I replay the video. This wastes data and since there are no truest unlimited data plans at 4g or better it causes slow downs by wasting my data
Troubleshooting. My YouTube was working fine earlier today but then it started having trouble.  I wont load anything and keeps saying an error has occurred even though I am connect to 5g internet and data.  Could you guys pls look into it
Great. Thanks for everything My only suggestion would be is there anyway to reduce data in streaming? It cost a lot of money and if that was reduced the device would be perfect
"App update needed. Would have 5 stars but the ability to manage your channel information is severely lacking. I have attempted to change my profile picture multiple times &amp; it always freezes when I am cropping. I hit the save button, nothing happens. I hit the cancel button, nothing happens then either. I have to ultimately force close the app to be able to use the app again. Highly annoying. Plus, YouTube Studio is trash because you cant even upload on there or manage your channel info. You guys are slipping on the application version. Not only that, I find it unreasonable to not be able to change your email address for your channel. Ive been needing to update my email for a while now since I have a new email address &amp; to no avail. Do better guys. Please. "
"Return the proper video quality option. Badly needs a bandwidth limiting option When I select data saver i need 144p, not 720pSelecting low definition with every new video is a massive time waster and isnt viable"
"Like app BUT. I actually like this app most of the time, however now that my son likes to watch movies and we have watched the ones we have at home like 300 times each I wanted to let him watch new ones on my phone. Due to the amount of data it takes, we dont live near any WiFi connections and I only have my phone to view them on, I wanted to down load it to watch later with out using more data. Unfortunately, I am unable to down load any movies rated for children. Now this seems ridiculous to me I would think it would be the other way around where some could not down load rated r movies so kids cant just down load bed movies at will. I think it would be better if we could at least down load kid movie with a pass word or something if we can prove we are the parent at least come on that is why I use you tube to see music videos and so my son can see kid movies. But I only 5G so he cant watch his favorite ones two or three times because it used all my data, To bad I really did like this app but now I  dont use it very much"
Done. Need to up your age groups and get minors off hacking and harassment fraud abuse and better safety concerns about abuse and harassment not alerting me when its done and they abuse others privacy rights and it needs to stop god bless yall Yes please up age for users and fine porn hubs
"Too bad Im paying for nothing. YouTube used to work just fine I pay for YouTube premium and I loved it however Im going to have to cancel my subscription because YouTube is the only app that refuses to download on my new I phone 12. Very disappointed that I cant enjoy this app anymore. Have no idea why it will not download, wont even try"
"Info. So much varied information offered.  Enrichment, enlightening and enjoyed"
YouTude please help me. Privacy concern. Hey YouTude I loved your app until a couple days ago when I noticed the screen recording and audio red thing in the top left corner of my iphone. The thing is idk if this is because I clicked the allow voice thing for YouTude. It told me that it would only listen to my voice while I record a video ( I dont have a channel) or when I am using my voice to text in the search bar. This is very concerning to me because of my privacy and others. I do know that you can get in trouble for this so I am hoping you will see this and then you can fix it before you get in trouble. I love your app. It is probably the most used app on my phone. This is why this is such a big concern to me. And that is the only reason I left the stars I did. Please help. Thank you for reading If anyone that is not a YouTude worker then mabey you can put this as helpful or something like that to help boost this comment so it can get on there radar more. And comment your experience if this has happened to you. The more of us the better. If you made it this far then thank you for reading and have a wonderful day Or night. GOOD BYE 
"Ugh. I have this a 1 star review just for the simple fact that it keeps telling me Im offline, taking ages to load and when I finally do get a video to watch, the comments section and recommended videos arent able to connect. I truly dont know what the issue is but everything else that uses data or WiFi on my phone works except YouTube. Even freaking Hulu works. This is frustrating"

You tube. Or downloading properly and the data account is for myself on this new iPhone 11.Cc.Freedom mobile.ca
"The update ruined the entire app. I dont know what happened,I was just watching regular YouTube,then it began to flicker between connection and no connection.so I just began to use my data. All of a sudden I just kicked from the app,and when I load back in no videos pop up on the home page,trending,the subscriptions,or the inbox.i cant search for videos,and when I sign out it still dose the same thing.I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEND YOUTUB JUST STOPPED WORKING"
"Horrible. Horrible app with so many fake bought reviews stop trying to personalise anything u know i watch All of the things this stupid app is creating are just annoying and i dont wanna see it Im already annoyed enough with your bloody ads that i will forever refuse to watch internet is going into bad bad direction. Terrorising people with pointless ads, collecting lots and lots of personal information just so u can sell us something new"
Im scared right now. Ok for some reason whenever Im watching a video on this app it usually keeps the videos I watch in my history right? But then a couple of minutes or even hours later I dont see them in my history no more I had never deleted the videos I watched at ALL now all I see are the videos that Ive watched yesterday I keep on refreshing and refreshing and refreshing it doesnt show the videos that I have watched today. Its so frustrating that I have to deal with this and now I cant even finished watch a video.I really dont know if someone is hacking my account I change my password recently and it still does this. Please someone help me if anyone have anything similar like this and you were able to get out of this situation please let me know how to fix it. Im getting really mad right now that the videos that I have love to watch or didnt finished watch arent in my history no more please help PLEASE
This is a great app. Hey I first got YouTube I didnt know what to watch but then I started to watch random channels and I loved it. I would recommend this app.I can watch whatever I want as long as it appropriate. And YouTube makes sure of that Download YouTube
Too many ads. Love the app but there are way too many ads so far I have turned off well over 862 ads PointersIf ads are bugging you delete the app this will delete all the data then re-install the app but do not interact with any ads ALL the ads the have been bugging you Will disappear
"Love utube DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. like about paying ?????HOW MANY RED  THINGS  ARE THERE WHAT IS THE    DIFFERENCE??and  Are these  Annual  payments?MONTHLYOR WHEN EVER YOU WANT?very confusing,WHERE IS THIS INFORMATION?------ALSO  HOW CAN A PERSIN HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL ACCOUNT?HOW CAN I  PUT MY OWN VIDEO UPWHAT ARE THE RULES-   Because Its too much info I do not  get it?is this app   FOR   POSTING A VIDEO  OR   JUST WATCHING?and Watching on what devices  with  what app  this app says  several actions?THAT IS EHY I HAVE DELETED IT.when i cant understand  i back away"
So good. I havent seen any glitches using YouTube I think its just incredible and interesting. It shows loads of youtubers
"What happened YouTube. What have I done to deserve snippets of films and old TV episodes you know what I like, you have the data Now I pay you so my child is not exposed to adverts and you give my old TV what happened to good talks by new authors, home hacks and decent documentaries, may be the odd concert by a band I like or debate between two academics.They really should add an interest button on the iPad app at least then I can choose not to be sent videos of bizarre east European music"
The best app ever. This app has every single YouTube video it gives you everything you need and just dont let your kids watch anything to an appropriate always make sure what theyre watching but if youre going adult please watch out for any age besides if youre under 12 or 18 please do not watch inappropriate videos but this app is amazing and it has everything what you need to do like if you have a broken jumpy house Ill tell you where to go and what to do if you have a broken phone it will tell you what to do if you dont know what to do just dont listen to a lot of hack videos because those are normally just tricks for your life
"YouTube, an amazing app but has just started acting weird. Ive been using YouTube ever since I was a little kid and YouTube was working fine this morning. Great app. Now all of a sudden when I go to watch a video, the video doesnt load, instead it just keeps on buffering and buffering. I tried on my PS4 and the smart tv and I got an error code. Its not my wifi or my mobile data because the connections with games and the App Store is very good . So I signed out of my account on the YouTube app on phone because I thought that was going to fix the problem, and that didnt. In fact it made it worse I cant even load a video yet see what Im looking at anymore. YouTube is a very great app but without YouTube I find myself very bored and not entertained. I hope you see this so you can please fix this aggravating issue. Thank you"
Bring back dislike button. Bring back the dislike button and Ill rate it 5 stars. Until then enjoy not collecting my data as Ill be going elsewhere
Need. Every time I use my data this stupid restriction things turns on but when Im on the WiFi its offNeed to take restriction mode off tbh
"Too many interruptions with goddamn commercials. As a title said  non stop flipping constant nonstop commercials when you play the goddamn video 1 to 2 commercials two minutes later another commercial five minutes later another 2 to 2 commercials and then nonstop commercials, and google spies on youscrew you Google"
"IM GETTING TARGETED. Okay, Im starting to freak out. I saw a post by a famous YouTuber. She said that there was someone messaging her to be friends two times in a row. Somebody said to not sub to him because he \ she could be a potential bot and could take your personal information and actually SELL IT or some crazy crap. So here I am, in my head thinking at least its not happening to me but its like he / she read my mind, because he actually MESSAGED ME ON YOUTUBE TO BECOME FRIENDS. So I said no, and deleted his comment. Well a few minutes later, he commented AGAIN to be friends. I got another comment similar from a different channel, but my trust was already dangerously low. So I said he was a bot and no. What I think you guys should do is put a spot for bots in the report section or just find and terminate them yourselves. Thank you for reading this and I hope it gets better"
"Ads. Heres a 10 second ad for a 30 second video, but hey we will just shove it right in the middle for you to divide the info your trying to get"
Hate the No Dislike count and absolutely hate the notification clubbing. These suckers at Google have lost the innovation edge. Theyre using the best talent in the world to push amateur features. I love the dislike count. Why did you remove the dislike count? Who are you to decide that for me? I like my notifications un-clubbed. Give me an option to decide. YOU DONT DECIDE FOR ALL OF US
BEST WAY TO GET INFO. I  YouTube because I personally think that its a good source to get information about a topic for school or just because you wanna search it up. I also  YouTube because its like your watching your favorite TV show and if you wanna watch the episode again you can without waiting for it to show up again. And I  that you can get YouTube on a TV too
New features make this app more accessible. Love the ease of access to closed captions for ease of understanding the content with fewer steps. The addition of the autoplay button makes it easier to control data use and allow for better flow for uninterrupted viewing. Great decisions
Not too happy with the removal of an important feature. I would always use the dislike ratio when looking up tutorial videos to know if the video was good and didnt contain bad or misleading info but now that I cant see the dislikes anymore I have to waist a bunch of time skimming through them
"Bug needs addressed. I dont dislike this app. However so the next billing period came around and my data was re-set unlimited data and I opened youtube and nothing loaded. I tried everything from deleting and re-downloading the app, reseting my network settings, updating the app and my phone. Still nothing, and I know its this app because other apps do work with my data plan. So the question is, there anything else to try?"
"Blocks videos. I would prefer to judge for myself any videos that I shouldnt watch, I also dont like how pictures are blocked and you cant see. I dont think your fact checking is as accurate as you think. The reason you got two stars is because I enjoy watching documentarys"
"Thank you. Thank you for helping me get through life. I wish I could talk to someone at Google, I would be an asset to the team.In fact, I allow Google to collect data so I am already an intern.Seriously though, if by some crazy chance you read this Mr. Google, save me from my current situation and the payoff is all my brains creative power blessed with the Holy Spirit.  I need someone to talk to about getting my life in order.I cant wait for you to respond.  I am waiting, and out of ignorance for the sake of comedy, sending this from an Apple device.In laymens terms, will you put me to work please?Gods will be done"
Videos. Is something wrong with YouTube? I can only watch for a couple of seconds until I get kicked out then Ill get a resume video. In order to watch a video I have go in about 30 times. Is there something I need to do? I know if I delete app I will lose data but I dont mind as long as it works again . Thank you
Zero respect. Want to watch it says its private. Plus so many adds
"YouTube history. Hello. I have a problem with YouTubes history. It is not just me but the other YouTube users have a problem of history updated videos. For example, I watched a recent video and want to check the video if it is there. It doesnt say it and I even delete all my data just to find a solution. Please fix this and I want it to be completely solved. Please let me know as soon as possible"
I love YouTube. Whats happening with the app lately? The thumbnails arent loading and I have to keep closing and reopening the app Its not my data connectivity as Ive checked it. The app seems to load properly when connected to wifi but not cellular and no my cell data speeds are fine. Fix it
"I hate YouTube Shorts. These shorts are literally TikTok but without selling all of your data to Xinnie the Poop, but keep all of the stupidity and idiocy. I hate shorts more than actual shorts (the clothes)"
Can be much more efficient. Great app but needs to add continuous playbaxk when selecting favourite to your personal playlists as whenever your selecting a song or video you want to enjoy the video with no interruptions then theres bit more consumer interactions if this feature is enabled
Rating you tube. You tube gives me incredible recommendations when I have no idea what to watch and I spend hours and hours watching you tube and it is great. My only issue is that for some reason it recommends to me stuff that isnt even related to my search history like when it recommended to me a video about cheese and someone tell me when I had a search related to that. But other than that it is the best app. Love you you tube
Place To Get Information and More. A  place to get information on any subject you want. Plus a place to watch shows purely for entertainment. I watch You Tube for 90% of my tv viewing. Never run out of things to watch
"Personal legend. Mindfulness at its best Bravo Continue making more videos, youre good and so its your friend"
"ADDS ADDS ADDS. I clicked on the video 30 times and it gave me to same add. I closed it, clicked the video, same add. Pathetic. I dont use the app often enough to pay for subscription so when I try and look up a video or song theres a 50/50 chance Im going to get an add. And the add isnt some short little 30 second add, these things can drag on for 5 minutes. Doesnt matter if I close the add, my data was already charged the 5 minute add. 5 minute add for a 3 minute song I wasnt even able to listen to.  This is their way of making you pay for subscription or theyll fk up your phone bill. Its all about money and Im never paying a cent.I have unlimited data so I dont care about adds, I hardly use the app. But when I do Im absolutely buried in advertisements.I do feel sorry for the people who cant afford unlimited internet usually meaning they cant afford subscriptions either, so YouTube is off limits if youre not willing to bend over for them"
"Can't upgrade. I do not have the fastest ipad and this version requires ios 10. What was wrong with the old version of youtube? Every time you change for the better it gets worse. I believe this is another trick by apple and google to sell new iPads and ads I refuse to upgrade my ipad, because every time I do I lose a lot of my data. What an unnecessary headache On top of that if I use safari then I loose all my saved videos and songs. You guys have become really greedy. Fix this before you loose all your audience"
Curators. I do use your site for your own personal opinions on facts. I come for facts only and my lack use this past couple of months is a direct consequence of this
Best app ever. I have been watching YouTube for years now and it is absolutely incredible  download it will make   your life better
. Youre a lying snake that has a personal vendetta against BTS. Whats your problem? Is it cause theyre not paying you? Are you that money hungry? I understand there are new policies but you cant just apply them to BTS alone and think were gonna act like youre innocent? Fix yourself
"Tampering with data. Multiple times when I was viewing a video, the view number lowered. I found this to be concerning. I definitely have less of a belief in the integrity and honesty of the app. I will be using other apps in place of this more now"
"Amazing. I enjoy all of the people that I subscribe to, they have great content. Also, it has been very helpful when looking for information to help solve problems around the home"
"Bring back old video quality settings. Whoever thought this new approach to video quality settings was a good idea needs to be put in timeout. Having to go into another sub-menu to choose the specific video quality, and replacing the old menu with the vague higher quality and data saver options. If I set a video to 1080p, I want that for ALL the videos Im about to watch, its seems like a small complaint, but having to mess with video setting for every single video Im about to watch gets annoying fast and adds up over time. You tried to make something less complicated, only to then make it more complicated. Please fix"
Live streams. Live streams over data like 5G are still bad on my phone
"Offline Mode only shows Downloads. I have YouTube Red, uh Premium, which allows me to Download videos to watch when Im offline, or to save data by avoiding streaming.  If Im in Offline Mode, all I have access to are the videos Ive downloaded. Why cant I have access to the playlists that have downloaded videos too?"
Commenting. Id love to share my comments but I dont want to sign up and share my information
GIVE BTS THIER VIEWS BACK. This happened last year so its personal isnt?
Best app for watching videos videos. I love this up so much and I watch it 24 seven this app is amazing and I would just say you can watch all your favorite Youtubers in subscribe to them for free
"Get your algorithm together. Today, over 100 MILLION videos were deleted off of BTSs new music video ON, of which every single one had been earned through the hard work of their fan bases streams. There is a MASSIVE amount of evidence showing view counters going down incredibly, people reloading their pages to find the view count down by millions, etc. The views were 100% through human effort (although we cant say it was absolutely without robots, the incredible majority of views were from humans) and yet these views were deleted as if they were bots. This is ABSOLUTELY unfair; records could have been broken, and YouTube has manipulated this achievement by changing the view count. This has been a problem for YEARS; whether its an algorithm or a person manually deleting these views: STOP. These views were well deserved and earned; we did not deserve to have them taken from us. Please return the views, and change your system so that this NEVER happens again"
Fix the Library pls. So when i remove a video from the library while Im still watching it when i leave from the chain of videos i watched it remembers and it puts me at the point i stopped watching it. What Im trying to say is when i removed a video from the library it was such a good way to hide what i was watching from others. Think about privacy mmkay? Mainly this only works for videos the library shows at a beginning or midway. This doesnt happen for ones where the point shows at the end. Think u can make it always show at the end of the vid or for at anytime i stopped watching it always start from the beginning once i removed it? Thx NOW I HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM When i watch a video that i have on library in a chain it goes to the point where i stopped watching it the FIRST TIME and it remembers where i stopped NOW after i stop the chain. PLS FIX THIS ITS OBNOXIOUS P.S. i think its a good idea you go back to the version before this happened. Do u remember when u guys changed things causing this to happen? Hope u do I think it was 16.34 this happened. Maybe you can bring that set up and same coding back? Is this intentional btw?

The best school. YouTube is the best school of learning and its completely free just took data. I learned a lot from the YouTube. All i want to say  I Love  you youTube  i know you knew that. 
24/7. If it wasnt for you tube I wouldnt have the life I live. The life I love The people Iv met through watching there movies and vlogs is incredible and the money theyve made through you has helped them continue to keep me entertained. I dont watch tv no more just 100% YouTube
"Privacy please. Whenever I click allow microphone, and get out of the app it says its screen recording? This is concerning because I dont want people listening to me"
Great app its my fav. This app yt is my favorite and its my most used app Ive ever used in my life sometimes adds can get annoying but there are so many channels with thousands of video on each one and when I dont have WiFi I dont know what to do because I dont have premium or data on my iPhone
"Done with the home tab. Cant disable muted autoplay or videos while scrolling? Guess Ill stop scrolling altogether. Glad I was able to snap out of it after all these years. My recommendation? Hop into your library section and get to work on all that content youve been waiting to check out, either in your watch history or watch later playlists. Finish what youve started, consume content INTENTIONALLY. Autoplaying videos as you scroll is not some benefit, or fancy feature, or innovation meant to serve you. Its an abuse of your senses. Its predation upon your most fundamental mechanisms for processing information. How little these higher-ups seems to respect your time and attention. Theyve got all the tricks and then some- all the data in the world- and wont hesitate to use it all to squeeze whatever they can out of you. Keep that in mind as this app AND YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH IT continues to change"
"Quality selection update. The new system is extremely frustrating to use, the app just eats data now, even if I changed the quality down to what I watch the 4 ads will play at 1080p"
Good but. Its a great app thats so fun to watch It has amolst everything on it and its perfect for wanting to know anything or if your just bored and want something to do. My one complaint is that Im not always connected to the internet and then I cant watch YouTube . I have my cellular data on and everything so Im very confused  it would be nice if I could watch it offline.  But overall great app  EDIT: I take that back yall. Problem solved great app thank you
"Bug fixes, space-time continuum???. More like, more user data collected for every update"
Dislike?. Removing the visible dislike data takes the voice away from users and the decision making influence is gone. Stoopid. Did you get rid of it to avoid facing last year's rewind events? Selfish
"Deducted views. For a new streaming music video On by k pop group BTS had many views and was climbing fast. But it was proven that YouTube itself took off over 60 million views. So the hard work of many were redacted and taken off. Many of these viewers had lost sleep and taken time out of their personal life to try to reach a new goal for the video but alas, much like other videos of BTS, a huge portion of the views were deleted. This is inconsiderate and incorrect to be done. The group has a huge dedicated fan base so it is understandable why the view count would be so high, but not why there would be a huge deletion of them"
Sell out. Get rid of your two ads you sell outs
"Dead app. Have been waiting for a video to load for 10 minutes with a 2020 phone and unlimited data. Dead app. Wont log me in to my google account, wont load. Deleted and reported for fraud.Its for the best. The site was a cesspool of sexism. Second only to Reddit"
My phone is hacked. My moms phone was hacked and now its blocking me from random videos like Minecraft most Minecraft videos I cannot watch unless I sign in which is impossible bc the phone is hacked oh and my channel is deleted and I cant subscribe like or dislike neither can I Comit I am about to delete this very bad
Bring back dislike. I use the dislike to fight false information
"IM IN AN OBVIOUS FILTER BUBBLE/DATA VOID/ECHO CHAMBER. I am not finding any more information that I might disagree with, is intriguing or is otherwise interesting.  I am noticing that all my search results only match closely whatever Ive seen before.  Thus turns me off from searching YouTube anymore for learning for other less profiling platforms"
Great app but I have a suggestion for you. I love YouTube I watch it all the time but I would love if you could add a button to remove all notifications. They piled up while I was at my personal camp and I have 2100 notifications. I would love a delete all notifications button please. I hope you take this into consideration and/ or add it in the next update. But overall I love it and would give 5 star rating if this is added thank you for reading
"You tube net work. This net work is most beneficial than other net works , you can find you needs,what ever which a human being can think about, I am sincere to it , thanks god for having this efficient tool ,With Many thanks to the valuable personal who are working hard to give comfort to the people of the world"
Can you give it 0 rating?. Do you enjoy torturing people with your broken updates? I have different apps on my phone but this is the worst of them by a long shot. Anytime I&#39;m on data connection it just breaks down and does not play a single video
Download it right now. This app is incredible. The details are amazing the menu is awesome and the youtubers have a lot of subs.The developers have worked so hard to make this app.There developers really are so much better at making apps Dont report it because I cant stop using it  wait theres something wrong.Some people dont like the app some tasks are in here. (Maybe not) a lot of people reported videos and disliked them so thats the problem.Sorry but I dont have any YouTube videos Thanks for reading this
"Some issues. While YouTube is great and all, theres some kind of issue that happens that every time I try to watch videos, for some reason the screen just shows off a black screen and the video refuses to watch play, making me close off the video and watch it again"
"Wants permission to my wifi for no reason and wont stop asking. Every singe time I open the app it asks me to connect to my PRIVATE network for unknown reason. I hit NO and it pops up again. I hit NO and it pops up again?? I close the app, I reopen, it pops up again.  Deleting this app yall are NOT STEALING MY DATA The most obnoxious disrespect for someones privacy Ive ever seen dont download this malware"
Deletes Views. Please do not delete views. i was watching like a human
Why cant I select my video quality permanently. Why does the video quality setting always revert back to auto? It always selects he highest option. I want to set the data saver mode when Im running low on data but it always runs itself off. And. Why is the exit full screen button so ridiculously small. Of course its going to be the button people select at the end of a video nearly all of the time. Why is it the smallest So annoying
Easy Access. Easy to find information Better than television Its the new wave
Homepage autoplay problems. Where is the option to turn this off? Who wants every single video paused over for one second to play? Most people read the titlesMaybe some people find their playback history useful and dont want it filled with their entire feed.Besides the fact that you never get the gist of video in the first few seconds so why bother?Are we trying to capture data about who thought briefly about watching a video without an actual decision being made?
Deleting views. They shouldnt be deleting views of the artist its unfair but hey a new record might be made by all the views deleted
"Updating. Updating so they can spy on us better. China needs to know our every move and like, so they can use it against us. Same with our own NSA. Uh oh, he watched a Traveling Willburies video  whats he up to? "
"Good with terrible performance. The app performs some basic functions as expected but is seriously lacking . The app never accurately keeps track of what you watched, how much you watched, and consistent across devices. It also seems like it is marginal when you are offline even if you are watching downloaded videos. Also its difficult to organize your playlists and tagged videos. Sorry I have to give a poor rating"
"The recommendations are so bad. Please make the recommendation algorithm more like TikToks. This is so terrible. I have to scroll through 100 videos just to find a single video I wanna watch. Im constantly giving the algorithm feedback as well, but see no improvement. Come on YouTube, youre supposed to have the best data scientists and ML engineers in the world. Do better"
"Videos need to load. The new update didnt change the comment section for me somehow (which is good and it should stay that way) but its almost impossible for me to load a video in anything higher than 360p. I have this issue both on wifi and data, and I have fiber optic internet that doesnt have connectivity issues. The point of YouTube is the watch videos, so they need to be able to actually load"
antithesis of function. ipad app is literally retarded in every way as goog does prob on purpose    btvhasss pretend engineering crew   more like data derelicts Now w Peonouns
Good and fix it HD to 360 forever. Please fixed HD to 360 low for my data. I not like reset back to auto HD I want leave 360 forever. Same on Apple TV back to HD eat my data mobile broadband Fix it leave it forever
"Its the bomb. I find myself rarely watching anything else.  I can watch my own personal programming.  Education,history, etc"
Learning. Information I get from u tube feels great can spend hours watching
"Bug report. Hey, you might want to fix this. I found a glitch or bug that doesnt allow me to change video settings. It just says Error saving video data and becomes private. So thats a bug you need to fix"
"Allow us to select actual video qualities again. A tend in seeing with this app is that every update it goes downhill. Are we considered to dumb to select our own video qualities, only high or low? If this was supposed to help save data you could have just put the same data explanations under all the video options.I want to watch this 1080p video in 1080p, but the rare time higher quality does anything it sets it to 720, most the time the setting changes nothing and it stays at 480"
"Comments. hi i saw you guys recently moved the comments closer to the video. just a personal opinion, but i prefer the comments where they were before"
configuration is not working. I hate the new update  How can it be possible that I cannot choose at what quality I want to reproduce the video?  and select to your liking when I am with my mobile data.  no sense in your new configuration
"10 second skip function ruined, age verification is process absurd, ads are insane. The ability to skip by ten seconds in a video is really useful, but now it seems to randomly skip whole sections without rhyme or reason. The age verification process is very annoying as I dont want to give away my personal details for something so insignificant; who even cares anyway? Lastly, the ads have become absolutely ridiculous: So many unskipable 15 second ones, so many chains of 2 ads in a row, pulling you out of the comment section when an ad starts playing, ads right at the end of a video. It genuinely feels like youre being brainwashed or something"
"FIX YOUR APP GOOGLE. Since the latest update (which was 2 months ago, uncharacteristic from the normal weekly bugfix updates), I\'ve been running into issues more and more. The two largest issues I\'ve been running into:-Endcards in fullscreen: For some reason, endcards are placed way too far down in fullscreen, making them unreachable or very hard to reach. This is really annoying, but manageable.-Links in the Description: This is the an issue I\'ve run into recently. Essentially, links in the description that lead you to other parts of the app are unclickable, showing you that indeed it knows you are clicking on it, but it fails to link you to the page that you clicked on.These issues could\'ve been solved as soon as they were discovered, but it turns out that Google decided not to update the app for a specific reason: they\'d have to give further privacy info, due to a new App Store requirement enforced after the day that the latest updates for all the Google apps came out. (They haven\'t publicly confirmed this, but it\'s very likely that this was the case.) So I ask Google: Get your act together, and fix your app"
Wow. Amazing. It lets you watch videos and connect to the information superhighway.Why are you looking for reviews? You should already have it. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL
"Update crashes App. After the automatic update (15.45.2), YouTube now does not play any video. Its stuck on the loading screen forever. Doesnt change with mobile data v wifi. Doesnt change when restarting phone. Doesnt change when restarting app. Doesnt matter which video. Poor form to release an update that stops the app from functioning"
"Amazing. I love how even if your not signed in, youre able to keep track of what you searched up and sometimes even watched. Even if your not signed in it collects videos that you like to watch and recommends them A definite 5 star"

"BALANCE. Before people decide on their views from Utube look and adjudicate both sides... do you believe on the side of facts by those who are specialist in this field or by politicians, people who falsely claim to be specialists or by the weight of peoples personal views. Do your homework and research thoroughly by accredited sites, not Wikipedia... they too are just manipulated by whoever wants to go in and change the facts... Above all take the time and seek the truth"
"Thank you for the laughs and good and helpful info. I enjoy watching a lot ,I love almost all your content I love that is diverse and oneself can get info about something specific or watch a movie or documentary just to past the time"
"Please send investigation link. I saw Mike Lindell had his video blocked because he broke your policy rules, where in his video he was having analysts say check if the data about the election fraud had any foundation, but you block only one side of the conversation.  If youve seen or done a complete investigation into the voting anomalies (which you must have done before  committing to shutting down anyones social sites for people and companies who represent conservatives in America). Please send me the link to the finished investigation on voter fraud so the American people can see the false message of Mike Lindell based on real facts and not your emotional cancel culture approach"
"brilliant. Some fantastic videos all round But you can select what is personal to yourself, great"
"Return the simple video quality menu. The new video quality menu is counter intuitive. I have to click through two sub menus just to select the highest quality picture, even if i go to settings and change preferred video quality to high (say 1080p60fps for example), it will still play the video at the auto or lower quality (360p - 480p video quality) wether it be on wifi or mobile data. Also i don\'t really care much for the youtube shorts, its not bad (if i can get a option to recommend less of this content  that would be nice), though they do create a glitch on the history menu where they will not delete after i swipe left on the video, as if not responsive.Though overall the update is good"
"Doesnt save my settings . Doesnt save my resolution setting So, quickly wipes my mobile data. So, will be UNSUBSCRIBED and UNINSTALLED "
Great information and entertainment. Love the app
"Need help. YouTube will not work without WiFi on my iPhone se and I cant figure out why. Ive tried restarting the phone, offloading the app, and Ive tried Turning my data on and off but it doesnt help"
"Gucci . I really love YouTube But theres a small bug that I found when Im changing my personal picture on the google manager button when Im updating my account. And that glitch really annoys me Can you please try anyway to fix this glitch so it doesnt stick with one picture? Like when Im commenting a video it has that picture I want, but for some unknown reason it changes to the older photo that I dont want. Can you guys try your best to fix this bug please? Thx "
"Data Collection & Interface. For a simple video player this app collects an unreasonable amount of identity data. On top of that the UI is slightly inferior to the Android version. For example, swiping a video up on android takes it to full screen while here it requires pinching out. I understand wanting to ensure Apple gestures work as expected, but theres absolutely no reason both shouldnt work. The experience should be identical on both platforms. It works as expected with nothing exceptional and is privacy invasive: 2"
"Perfect app Except. Its a great app that I use daily although why do I have to give my ID to watch music videos and compilation, I dont want to sell my data for some videos that dont need to be age restricted Its ridiculous"
Thanks for finally updating. One star for the privacy nightmare
Comical version updates. I dont find it very professional to put thing like explored the edge of the known universe. I went in looking legitimate information on previous updates. I fell like your Devs are intentionally hiding what there doing in updates and/or mocking the people who support your app. There are other streaming services for people maybe I should uninstall and go with a Company who cares about keeping there customers informed on  the data there putting on there devices
"Privacy betrayal. Even though I have my location services turned off, I continue to get localized ads directed towards me. Something smells fishy in the state of Denmark. Far too many ads"
Ads no mater. I loved it so I left a 5 STAR because I can watch other people (and learn hacks)
"I dont need an upload/go live button. I just want to view my subscribed channels. I dont care about your garbage clips, terrible algorithm, or horrendous streaming service. Let me view what I want to view and what I organically discover on my own outside of this data mine"
Hey. I love how my recommendations show people who I watch and nothing else. 
"Praise to my LORD JESUS. I am ever so grateful that I can use thus app to sing songs of praise and adoration to the KINGS of my soul. It is both an pleasure and privilege to have this venue for my personal time in worship to my LORD. Ive also learned a few good things on YouTube, such as fixing my Dishwasher door disconnecting and removing the vanity sink, faucet and countertop. As a woman that fantasticIve many natural remedies which has worked.Great tips and info on gardening, gettingEliminating ants inside and outside Nail art.Really good stuff.I also has a wealth of knowledge I should begin to share with YouTubers.Thanks Youtube"
Its ok. Alright so it sways it will delete all data but as soon as I delete it its saves everything you watched before
Why would you download this app. I love it so much there is literally no better app then thing to just relax and watch videos
"Usually good, update messed with it. I havent really had a problem with the app until now, but it refuses to load 90% of video information now. No title, description, comments, recommended videos, nothing. The video playback isnt affected but not being able to just look at related videos is messing with my YouTube flow. I dont know if this is just because I have an older model phone (iPhone 6s Plus, new to me), but I would like this fixed ASAP please"
Only plays ads properly. Im in a low data area. YouTube can quickly play an ad perfectly without interruption at what looks like a higher resolution but the low resolution video Im trying to watch will never load. Horrible app
"Bug fixes, space-time continuum???. More like a lot of user collected data applied for every update is priority and less bug fixes"
"Video quality. I absolutely HATE the new video quality menu When I tap video quality, I expect to access resolution settings. Instead Im met with a massive data saver menu... why?? What used to be the default quality settings are now under the advanced tab. The data saver setting should go back to (AND STAY) in my USER SETTINGS"
Help. Theres a glitch making it so i get administrator restricted mode even tho my mom and dad both have not done anything to it. I can still watch pewdiepie and all weird channels but I cannot comment. The only way u can even fix it is use cellar data but I do not have that. Please have this issue fixed. Thank you
YouTube nor playing -Messages no connection. YouTube doesnt work for me.I tried all suggested fixes and none work.Same for Lowes/Stock and possible others.I have tried both wireless and data but no success.This is a $1300 phone that work worse than  a $200 phone.Im new costumer and vey disappointed I will never buy again iPhone
"You Tube. It is my personal favorite application. Its like having a school right at my finger tips.For me You-Tube is everyday. Its like going to school and researching all you want. I feel if one uses this opportunity for learning great and wonderful things, why not"
"Glitches out constantly. I pay monthly for YouTube premium but Im questioning if I should continue. The app takes forever to load, then when I finally get a song it takes forever to buffer and half the time the app crashes and I have to restart it several times before I can get a song to work. About 3/4 of the time the app just closes by itself while Im using it and I have to restart it. The downloads that are supposed to be available when you are offline dont work most of the time either and that was a huge perk to why I started paying for this app. Ive done all the updates, uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing has made it better. Doesnt matter if Im using data or WiFi or what device I try to use it on. About ready to try a different music app because this is so frustrating and most of the features for paying for the upgrade dont even work"
"Latest update. I want to set my own video quality depending on my preferences. When I am off wifi I prefer 144 to reduce data, but the new update does not allow me to go below 244. I set it using the manual setting and it simply says it will apply but does not. Terrible update"
I hate this spp. I hat this app thay  take your information and sell it to China and thay use your data. 
I cant download videos on YouTube after I update it it only download with wifi anyone can help ?. I cant download videos on YouTube with mobile data it only shows wifi
"Revert the video quality options. Its bad, everyone knows bigger number= more clear and more data. Why ruin something that was already good even in 200mbps WiFi i need to manually select 1080 and not 720 on iPad even on auto now and never goes to 4K. More steps for quality and made auto quality worse IMO"
The download problem. when tf did downloading videos join youtube premium... i normally download videos cause they take a lot of data streaming them offlinedo you expect me to pay for youtube premium...this is why youtube is dead
"Amaazzinngg Apppp. There are so many different things to watch and so easy to access So fun But I recommended little kids under 12 to not download this app. Thats because there are also a lot of underage stuff posted. But otherwise, I love watching gacha and funny stuff"
Horrible. I got the app and all was good until tarantula videos popped up. I did NOT see them but more popped up. I am a kid.I am forced to see this TRASH at the cost of my data. Do NEVER get this if you are afraid of spiders and bugs
I need more data??????. Im not happy with my data All I do is watch retrieving data and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait can you do something about it can you do something about it can you do something about it can you do something about it Help
"Fantastic Resource. Needs minor improvements. The service needs better, more intuitive approach in saving and categorizing personal library files and subscriptions i.e sorting them by category, name of folders etc"
What the hell is going on with it I have data and keep showing error why not playing. What the hell is going on with it I have data and keep showing error why not playing
"Great app. Use this everyday, smorgasbord of information and a great community"
Amaaaaazzzzzing. You upload videos and other people can see them it works every time it automatically sends your device the correct packets of data so each video plays smoothly it works on big and small devices also includes audio which is an unexpected bonus closed captions work well and are useful if you can read
"Fix YouTube for the iPhone 12 mini please. So the YouTube app has been bugging out on the iPhone 12 mini for me. When I open the app the search bar, account, and other top buttons are squished and unresponsive when I go to click on them. When I get into a video and try to change the resolution it bugs out and shows me a white screen every time so it doesnt allow me to change the resolution, and while youre fixing things for the mini If possible could you please return the original quality control settings you had on YouTube before you added high/data saver quality? It acts like automatic and even brings me down to 360p on high quality, if you could make it go no lower then 1080p on high that would be great if you want to continue with high quality/data saver. So if you could tweak it a little to help us little guys out it would be very much appreciated thank you for your time and have a great day"
Confession of a serial DATA gatherer. Hundred percent of the time I have a strong urge to choke the people who interrupt my videos to show me their pathetic adds
Wasting my data. The new version sets the quality high even when I set it to minimum. I am listening to things not watching. It constantly changes the quality to high and is using up all my data. I set it to 144p stay at 144p not 360 or 720 the latter is not  data saving
"Can be with out you tube....I love my You Tube. Very usefull, for my projects and my kids and also for any good info for school or for a just a health information.. Very Good App"
New update. Severely dislike the new update. We get it. You want to force feed us more content like the little data slaves we are. But this new update is atrocious. Please revert the layout back. This is too clunky and gross lol
"WHAT IS THIS VIDEO QUALITY SETTING. If I want to watch my video in 480p or 1080p, I should be able to choose it just like I do on my desktop... or my Android. Adding the extra Auto/High Quality/Data Saver option is STUPID beyond all belief. It just makes my experience worse If I want to watch a video, the quality setting should be a simple Auto/1080/720/480 and so on, much like it has been FOR YEARS. This just adds extra steps to an already increasingly complicated app. I want the old version back"
Recommend. Right now when I watch a video I dont get videos that are related to what I watch actually its opposite of what I watch and when I put  Im not interested  on the videos and reload no more videos show someone please tell me how to fix this
My personal opinion. Good app very useful
Ask App Not to Track & Picture in Picture. Why arent we being asked if we want this app to track us? Everyone start paying attention Also Im a Premium subscriber WHY THE F*CK DONT I HAVE ACCESS TO PICTURE IN PICTURE
Love this app. I can watch everything I want and more Music cartoons how to video life hacks This is why I LOVE this app
AlexAlf. Best data base in the world Itll never be match with any apps ever. Keep up the fantastic job guys Always better than the rest.Cheers 
Its good but still CussWords. Its good and theres Youtubers thats good but I recommend you look down below or just like search these you tubers the spy ninjas and remember dont follow project Zorgo
"Can\'t upgrade. I do not have the fastest ipad and this version requires ios 11. What was wrong with the old version of youtube? Every time you change for the better it gets worse. I believe this is another trick by apple and google to sell new iPads and ads I refuse to upgrade my ipad, because every time I do I lose a lot of my data. What an unnecessary headache On top of that if I use safari then I loose all my saved videos and songs. You guys have become really greedy. Fix this before you loose all your audience"
"Why Remove Dislikes?. We are facing a world that refuses to accept the idea that people have negative impressions of the world around them. From children who all win participation trophies to people interpreting the smallest criticism as hating, with this removal of dislikes we drift further towards the world of coddling the population while massive corporations, like the one that owns the app Im using to write this review or the one that owns the app that Im reviewing, continue to steal and distribute user data at prices that rival gold. GG WP, YouTube, GG WP"
"Forgets a lot of things. The app marks videos as watched, but then later forgets them as being watched. Make it difficult to keep track of where youre up to.Netflix does not seem to have this issue"
"best app ever. its free to do everything. including making an account, so you can subscribe to your fav channels so you get notifications when they upload. if you dont want the notifications - fear not. press the bell icon next to the subscribe button and you get occasional notis or just none at all. if you really like a specific video - click the like button. if you didnt like it, well click the dislike button. very simple to use, and very easy to use"
Amazing but. So I have a YouTube channel but yesterday I posted and the vid is called still a piece of garbage that is going to be my new intro but it is private so I went on edit and I pressed it so it can be showed to the world so anybody could see it but it keeps on saying Error can not save video data or something like that so please help it is really annoying because I worked really hard to edit that so please fix it :(
"No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture. Also, ability to add to watch later list or hide videos with left and right swipes. Most of the time videos gets stuck in waiting to download but never download. Finally, we need an option to filter out videos on the subscription and home feed pages that are already on our watch later list. I dont get why I would be suggested videos that are already on my playlist or that I have already watched"
Quality. Image quality used to be able to select what one preferred but now even when I select the number it goes UP to the quality it wants bringing my data usage up.  That sucks
"Wont load on Wifi. The YouTube app suddenly stopped connecting to Internet via wifi on all my devices. iPad, iPhone, firestick. ALL stopped working Works totally fine on data, other apps work, just not YouTube"
"All medical , physical , emotional and psychological videos. Am very happy and thankful we have  U tube. It s very helpful especially in this time of pandemic. With not much access to personal consultation in cases of medical informations and emergensies , U tube  fills it in. Full of informations, advices , tips, instructions , you name it"
This is the best app ever. You can watch anything you want on this app with no ads if you download you will not regret it
Peelu. Worst app. Anybody can update any information without legal authority. People upload videos with stupid information and want to subscribe there channel. If they want to subscribe or like there channel then open million dollar company to provide jobs for youth
This app is essential. Used every day all day. Business. Personal growth. Music. Tutorials
YouTube. Just enjoy all the tutorials Information is endless Enjoying all the information that I want but still having a hard time using the phone. So you know Im older than the other generations Lol
"Good but not Good. It was a good app but not anymore, I downloaded so many offline videos and just because I switched off my phone and put it on back, they are requesting I re-download all those videos again, again I was downloading a video and just because I ran out of data, just for me to buy data and return there, they download start from the beginning again and this is really costing me so much money and data"
This app utube. I think you should be able to opt out of the live on utube this is a privacy issue and it violates my rights to freedom. Legally there should be a on and off button for anything that is live. If this is not fixed then you may have lawsuits on your hands. I would recommend you fix this ASAP

"No more hidden videos. I clicked Show unavailable videos on my playlists, and I can't get rid of the private or deleted videos in my playlists"
Videos. I love the thing that I can stream watch even on my games I need help so that why I downloaded this app now because I had It a lot of times
I dont know what you guys did. I dont understand what or how you guys did what you did for this app but now the video history is never even close to accurate it only shows videos that I watched a few days or a week ago and nothing remotely recent also I have to start a video over every time I go away and come back to it. Can you no longer keep track of where I am in the video? YouTube on my computer or x box works and remembers where and what videos I watched with flying colors but not on the iPhone. You better remember the exact second where you are on a video if you have to reply to a text and do ANYTHING on your phone or uh oh I gues youve never watched this video before in your life
"Lots of information. I use You Tube for how to and instructional videos,nice having one place to go for almost anything"
"Cant support YT app. Anymore. As of 2021 if your in the EU / UK and want to watch a spicy vid, youll be required to prove your an adult, due to rubbish EU rulings.Proof is defined as an ID, Driving license or a passport, of you have none of those then you must give google/YT your credit card details.I for one find this disgusting and an invasion of personal privacy, I ask anyone who uses this app in the EU/UK to complain and uninstall and leave a negative review, this kind of action shouldnt be accepted / tolerated"
New Video Quality update. The new feature that allows you to choose quality of video based on the options higher picture quality data saver and advanced is a pain. Why not just just keep the feature where you can choose your video resolution or at least make sure that the higher picture quality is the highest possible resolution available for the video. I do not want to continue going into the advanced settings at the beginning of every video to make sure I get the best resolution available

Just a review. I hate the auto quality and the new place for the comments its very hard to forget where the comment section used to be and i dont like the new update something is going wrong the data is max and it wont do the video
Listening to information channels. I really dont like that I have to pay yall to listen to these news or information giving channels and be able to turn my phone scream off So all Im saying is the audio should still play if I turn my scram off without having to pay yall Does that make sense?I think it does right cause yall are a video platform Im only asking for sound a lot of the time
You tube and our tube. There is a ton of useful information on you tube the instructional information is amazing imo the best part of the internet by the people that use it.  No more do I need to search the net for information you tube usually has it all. Free knowledge priceless
stop deleting reviews. if you cant handle the truth ui is a mess to many menues. low data on 360p i dont think so add the advanced quality option for applying on all videos instead of let us choose between high and low mode?¿
Cant download YouTube. Hey I recently got an iPhone 13. While moving my data and papas from my other phone YouTube was deleted off the phone. Now when I go to the App Store to try and download it it has a cloud icon to download but nothing happens when I click it. I literally cant download YouTube to my phone. I have to watch YouTube on a browser. Please help
"Enjoyable experience app. Enjoyed watching entertaining videos and having information for practically nearly everything, but also A lot better and then watching TV that you had to pay for"
Uses too much data. You tubes new update still streams at 1080 when on data saver.  Please change this  There is no point in watching 1080P on a smart phone and at the camp I work at the wifi is fast but capped on usage.  I hate that I have to select a lower res every video and sometimes it still streams higher than I select
"Incredible. This is one of the best entertainment apps alongside Tik Tok, Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix. I rate it 1 million likes. YouTube is incredible, there are a lot of cool gamers. My favorite channel is Simple History, they have 2,800,000 subs. I suggest you get the app"
"Quality? You can\'t choose it. The app was decent until the most recent update where they changed how video quality is chosen, at the moment it forces videos to be the highest quality possible, and it doesn\'t actually change to your preferred quality even after you choose it. I\'m very annoyed by it as it uses more data than ever. I\'m not happy with this version of the app"
"Yall wackos. After I watched you video that was Blacklisted, about all the gov and high power ppl. And how your company is apart of the big 6 and many more. You guys stop letting me go the app. So yall do s3x tracking and Im just tryna do friendly things and watch some YouTube so give it back"
"Really good app. YouTube is extraordinary I love watching videos and #shorts were an incredible addition to the app YouTube has everything you may need, from recipes, sports, shows for littles, to even just music and entertainment I would recommend this app to anyone 100% Thank you YouTube for allowing us to watch content everywhere all the time <33"
Really useful app. Enjoy using this app which is an endless form of information and entertainment
Amazed. This app is incredible it lets you watch other peoples videos from across the world (worldwide) there a few videos with horrible language which I believe should have a question whether you still want to watch it this way I can watch grandparent safe videos with them x
Premium downloaded. Im Downloading a video for offline on cellular and every time I lose service the video restarts downloading from 0 again. Its killing my data and I need this downloaded so I can watch offline. You really need to fix this issue and pause instead of killing the download. You are wasting data on purpose. Netflix pauses so I know its possible and youre or of  the largest company on the planet so I dont understand why you do this.  Not to mention watched the video from start to finish and it still didnt download the whole video but restarted due to loss of service for 4 seconds without interruption in the video.  Im definitely canceling once my free trial is done youve destroyed my cellular data due to this. Its happened 15 times in a row finally stopped it and I guess Ill just stream it now even though Im premium. You win I lose thanks for that

I dont know what is going on with the app these past two years, but its been a laggy mess that slow-drags, rubber-bands, and freezes whenever a new feature tries to pop in during your searches. What is the point of downloading something, if the app is going to eat up the RAM trying to update the data surrounding your activity. I have an iPhone 5, and it bursts into flames if I try to move or tap on a video if I dont wait for the app to warm up. Warming up??? So my phone is a computer, and now is a car. I cant win...And I know the probable cause of the app being slowed down is due to the background ads being loaded. I have premium and I still get the worst aspects of ads? Give me a break.I just want to watch the monologue from The Late Show and my poor phone is being bogged down by all the ads, which should not be there; because I have premiumAll I want to say is, go easy on the new features (that go ignored anyways) and maybe make another app that requires premium to use it and remove all that unnecessary ad baggage that turns iPhones into molten plastic"
Love it. I live this app so much you can watch anything up to DIY hacks to the news
Enjoyment all day long. Enjoy most of stories information and everything else
Bad site when hacked because there site. Bad site when hacked they literally do nothing nothing even if they watching ur family even if they watching ur neices nothing
"Useless, update or quit. Used to work fine on my iPad, just opened it recently and it forces me to either &#39;update or quit&#39;. There are no updates on App Store for it or website(which just sends you back to app store) that I can find So kinda a waste of data currently"
"My personal view of You Tube. Brilliant, it has my A "
SOMEONE HACKED INTO MY ACCOUNT. SOMEONE HACKED IN MY ACCOUNT IN A LIVESTREAM AND SENDING HUMILIATING MESSAGES NAME IS TIRSIAK PLAYZ AND PLEASE TRACK DOWN SIGNAL
"Some of us have data caps. It upsets me when I have to constantly check the resolution of videos Im watching. The app constantly wants to show 1440p video. I have a data cap and just want 360p. Even the supposed data saver mode is clicking up to 720p. Let me have a GLOBAL resolution setting, not a per video setting"
"Annoying. Now has annoying popup ads about how the mean old Australian government is making them pay their fair share of money for content. Not your personal army, Google"
Nice and wonderful app but please cut down on the bots. There is so many bits trying to hack peoples accounts including mine other wise this app is 10/10 if there is anything u can do to fix this please do so there is so many young ones out there who will subscribe to the bots and get hacked please consider taking care of this thank you
"1080p mobile data issues. I currently have to use my mobile data and when I go to watch videos on 1080p the just buffers unless I leave the app in which case I wouldnt be able to see the video, is 1080p too much for my mobile data to handle or something? Because 480p works fine "
Great app. Great app. Its good that we provide access to video information
Terrible. Horrible application Steals your information Sell them for money Gives you annoying adds and make money off youListens to you and spy on you
My recommended tab. I dont know what it is but in my recommended feed I keep getting videos Ive already seen with the like red bar at the bottom of the thumbnail and it usually takes two tries of tapping the 3 dots on the side of the video to say I already watched it. Maybe its because Ive been using the same account for years so its over saturated with data. I also find like five of them in a row sometimes and annoys me a fair bit
"You Tube. This is the greatest application of all I use it every single day for research, morning devotion, news and information"
"Watch YouTube. It has tons of great shows and you can have your own channel subscribe, hit the notification bell, like videos, watch live streams and MUCH more Watch YouTube its a great app"
Spying app. Spy more
Apostle Dr. Ellis Melvin. I enjoy watching YouTube and YouTube is a good tool to use for our ministry and personal enjoyment you guys have been super good to all of us that are able to watch YouTube thank you so very much and may God take you so very far in your immediate advertisement and business
"Commercials. This app has been incredible for all these years and I havent complained anything so far, however its got to the point where i cant even watch a single video without a commercial, but not just one, we have to wait for two and its so irritating, please do something about it"
"Auto-quality doesnt work and searching livestreams. Auto-Quality for best quality never works even when the settings are properly turned on for use most data It always goes to 480p (and doesnt go up over time) even though its under the category of Higher Picture QuietlyAlso notifications for live streaming is idiotically mixed up with upload notifications Searching for a live streamer on YouTube is confusing and horribly designed app overall isnt bad, but theres always a few issues"
You guys take toooooooo filing much data to operate. Too much data
360p why. Fire your iu designer. why do I have to navigate through a ridiculous amount of menus to change the simplest thing? and switch the low data mode back to 480P or add the advanced Quality option for every video not just for a single clip
"Still cant switch accounts. Every time this app gets updated I still cannot switch between accounts which is my brand account and my main personal account. I cant get to my brand account its as if I dont have the option to press on switch accounts. I can only access my personal main account which is connected to my google account. Please, fix this problem"
Privacy problem?. The app is fine but why is my iPhone showing that your app is using my microphone for no reason?
Amazing. This app is magic you get to watch youtubers like itsfunneh flamingo and more DOWNLOAD THIS YOU WONT REGET IT
Disappointed. This app was great and you could watch anything but now it wants you to give them personal information to watch certain types of videos very disappointing I hate now cant even watch a PlayStation video this stupid you should be ashamed
TRASH. dont download. steal views
Watch history. The youtube history on my phone isnt working I keep on refreshing and nothing is happening
Hi agian. Hi AgianPpl can get scared.... and ppl HAVE to give out information sooooooo personal ppl can hack ya knowHOPE U ALL HAVE A GREAT LIFE MAY GOD BLESS U BE SAFE:-)
"You tube red. Worth every penny, no ads, down loads available no data used"
"Bring back the dislike button at least. The removal of the dislike button makes spam videos get significantly more play than they should I cant tell if a tutorial is old or out of date, or bad info. It contributes more to miss information, the removal of the like button had nothing to do with the creators it was all about large governments and big corporations in their power to dictate collective thought"
"Good feedback. So much info - good, bad, meh - on just about every topic  Love it "
Absolutely horrible. Ok I get it with the privacy terms but seriously just stop with the stupid blocked bull crap Im super annoyed with cant talking in live streams and not being able to comment Fox this stupid app This is a waste of time
Servers down?. Are the YouTube servers down? No video or ad will load I have restarted my phone and killed all the apps and Im still sitting here for minutes watching the load circle. And no its not my internet. I have a gaming internet that has 1 gb/ sec and I have excellent 4g lte unlimited non throttled data speeds. Yet the videos just sit there and load but nothing shows. And there are no sounds. When this issue is fixed I will retake with 5 stars
This is Amazing. Hi are you wondering what this app has it has  it has videos for all ages its full of info try it you can see peopleDoing in ther daily life and you can earn money by making a video for all to see you can also subscribe to others and people can you do the same to you you can like others video and get New contact listen to songs and have fun try it its amazing thanks
"The best app. Offers everyone so much happiness, love and information"
. Im having a hard time understanding why this is updated so often as it does not work streaming to either my Xbox or smart tv.. if anything perhaps updating to the latest tracking adware so they can hit you with ads they think are relevant to your search history
Low Quality videos. Keeps bringing my videos to 480p when I selected 1080p60 or more Im on a 5G connection so there should be no issue. I also selected mobile data higher quality option or even auto should bring it to 1080p
"How do People give this a 1?????. This is a great app You can explore the worlds interests and make your own if you want My personal favorites are Jelly, Crainer, and Tasty, a show that gives you tips about cooking and baking. I have my own and it is called Tobys Guide To Total Awesomeness. I am only eight so dont judge me This is a great app to explore and get information. People who are out there that give this a one, TURN THAT INTO A FIVE BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER I just wanted to brag about the developers of YouTube and how you guys are smart and creative. Hope that the COVID-19 goes bye bye"
Stop with the ads. The stupid survey adds are stupid you NEVER make any money its a waste of time and they steal information thats not ok stop making fun of us low class( poor) citizens and actually help for once
"A great app . Its absolutely great I have been using this app all my life and all the features are great easy to control, great privacy settings,saves your data and more great things  I have premium and it is also better with more benefits"
"Trying to get personal details the pedos. Cant watch many videos as they require age verifications in which you have to upload passport or card details.Absolute rubbish, scamming snowflakes with their cringe indoctrinating tending page which is going to result to kids growing up to be definite weirdos with abnormal mindsets"
problem fetching data. what does that mean and why cant i access my youtube ? big brother maybe ?
Good app but a few problems. The app tracks our location but doesnt give an option to disable that and when I am watching a video and exit the app for 5 seconds it does a 1 hour update so can you give a option in settings to turn off location and can you stop updating the app in the middle off a video
Why. Stop updating the app and making it worse. After the update I cannot load any videos with perfectly stable wifi or data. I click on a video and it doesnt stop loading. Why update the app if it breaks it
"Minor glitch. I noticed a minor glitch where YouTube wouldnt play any videos whatsoever, even though I have full signal for my data. Easy fix?"
"No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture. Also, ability to add to watch later list with one click like on the desktop website. Most of the time videos gets stuck in waiting to download but never download. Finally, we need an option to filter out videos on the subscription and home feed pages that are already on our watch later list. I dont get why I would be suggested videos that are already on my playlist or that I have already watched"
"Ugh. Forced me to update, while I could continue to watch videos behind the you MUST update alert.. ugh.. lemme use my own version, need to steal more meta data"
"Great but a few suggestions. I have been using this app for forever. It works great and you can block inappropriate content. But, as In today that Im writing this, if I try to open the app it just glitches out. I tried to restart my phone, delete it and download it again, but it wont budge. Also, whenever I use data to go on the app its very glitchy and laggy. Although this app is very easy to use, it can use some work in the future"
Bad app. Its good with watching and everything but then when Im gaming suddenly *notification* then I get kicked out of the game this is trashI lost all my data            \       /             .    .                _____          /.         \
The best app. Its so neat and so enjoyable because it has so many videos and my favorite YouTuber is chad wild clay/spy ninjas
"Monopoly. Well they dont have any competition, not a great App Advert overload, I accept adds but at the critical point of a video then I just stop watching. And on iPhone X I cant upload as I cannot allow access from the App to Camera - as the button didnt work. But the over use of adds is the main issue that stops me using the app more. and because its overused I refuse to watch any of the adverts. - would happily watch 1 per video but not more"
"Great video watch. I have always watched YouTube, and its incredible. I give about a 5-star boost to this app"
"Who can see my vids. The app is amazing and I could use it all day, but I have an issue with my listing. I will upload a video but I cant change it to Public. I will try to but this pulls up. Error saving Video Data So now Nobody can see my videos"
"Ive learned so many things from here. . I am just a guy who enjoyed my mind and self with some little things around my life by myself. I did learned and saw so many things that ive never been known to even exist, by simply because of using this. There are too many people who shared valuable informations from the other side of the world that I cant easily explore on my own. Like theories, tests or opinions from various scientists from verities of aspects, also the results of experiments, missions and etc etcAnd so, if isnt there, Ill never be the same guy today. If isnt there, ill never have a chance to know those incredible peoples and this powerful inventions and thus never ending lists.So, review and results might be no doubt for me, One and only thing that can modified me, one and only thing that drive me to a better and wiser version of myself. "
Someone keeps stealing my subscribers. I made a 2nd account yesterday I had 20 subscribers and a spam bot took 13 away from me and now I have 7 if you guys can catch spam bots that steal subscribers can you block them from getting into my account and find them if so thanks
Picture settings update. I do not like the new picture settings. It wont let me turn down the data Quality to below 480p while using cellular. I only get 5gb a month so I like to keep my video quality down to like 240p
Why I give this a three star. When I tried to watch Spy Ninjas it kept on freezing up and it was very annoying another reason is because there are SO MANY ADS
No internet issue. Every time I open the app on my iPhone it says theres no internet when I clearly have data. It only allows me to use the app when Im using WiFi
Best app it gives you information and you can watch for fun. Best app
"Recommending. I wont stop recommending this great genius hacker via;Truewebhacker  at Gmail dot com.. (207) 573-0563  They were very effective and 100% trusted. Ive gotten help from their team to hack my cheating wife cellphone activities without having access to the phone, they hack into any form of problem you want to solve such as call logs, text , gps, deleted contacts, pictures and social media apps at a very affordable cost. I was so happy to come in contact with the right team for the very first time.You can always reach him for any kind of help and your problem will be solve"
Um. So I would have totally rated it five stars because it is great and I use it all the time but...not too long ago I went to add something to one of my many playlists and it said that I wasnt aloud to anymore because I was a child and that I couldnt watch the mini screen at the bottom either. Now I am legally a teenager and all of a sudden it wont let me do these things. The only way I keep track of my favorite videos are because of my playlists and now I dont know what to do. I dont understand why this happened
You Tube. Keep up the great work. Never will get tired of watching all the amazing shows and information on YouTube
"No dislike button. I now have no way to gauge a videos quality before I watch it. I also have no way to tell if the video Im watching is a scam or spreading false information. Far more disadvantages than advantages, terrible move"
"Fine, entertaining. This app has been out for years and its nicely designed. I feel like the potential it can reach on the iPad is incredible, but they always refuse to add decent features. Its either locking system features behind a paywall or dealing with not having them at all. Personally I dont think some of the premium features are worth being, well, premium. Its just frustrating given the amount of money they have at their disposal already"
About error. Sometimes the error came to me while I publish the video is saying error saving data need to be fixed
I LOVE IT BUT LOST EVERYTHING. Ok look i love this app and its amazing but i just got the new iphone 12 plus and transfered all the data to this phone . I then erased the phone and traded it in to T-mobile . I dont know the password for this account so i cant get back in because it sighned me out after the data transfer and it keeps telling me to open google on the iphone 7 BUT I CANT BECAUSE I LITERALLY DONT  HAVE THE DEVICE . SO NOW I LOST ALL MY PLAYLISTS AND VIDEOS UPLOADED . PLEASE HELP I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO RECOVER IT NOW
Excellent app. Able access a varied selection of information from around the world
"Same advertising. I keep getting the same ad over and over and over, every time I say I dont like this ad it just keeps showing it I even tried switching on personal ad switch and I tried turning it off, Nothing has worked Im not sure what to do anymore Ive actually wanted to delete the app because of this because Im tired of seeing the same add continuously even when I dislike it. Why does this happen, do I have to uninstall and reinstall whats going on"
"Lots of good information. Often looking for info how to fix , where to go Most of the information is educational and helpful"
"So much ads. This is the worse, every time you are looking for some video or a tutorial which only 40 sec you have watch 2 ads and each of theme are 5 or 15 second which to calculate ads duration is more than the video. Its so annoying specially you are in hurry or you have less data then you will see so many ads that you will give up. Such a big big big disappointment"
"I Dont like the update. Hello, im here to just say that this app is amazingOnly the thing that i dont like is that when i want to choose the quality of a video there are three options AUTO, HIGH QUALITY, DATA ECONOMIZOR and ADVANCED. These options makes mich harder to choose the quality of a video.I dont know if this is going to help people to choose the quality easier, but i think this is not necesarry.At all so pleaseeee remove these options and put back how it was before Thank you and have a great day"
"If it aint broke dont fix it. Why is the video options now changed its now: awkward, full of text and a pain to read when I just want to select the video resolution? Everything else theyve changed regarding comments and such wasnt too bad but this is genuinely just worse than what was already there with no obvious way to turn it back to how it used to be? Sure its a nice option to have data always set to low but Im not sure its worth all the other features theyve taken away"
YouTube mistake. In you tube 100 k views equal 1 million views but it does not say 1 million views same with  subscriber l think our world is in a par rel universe or YouTube data is in a Parrel universe
Doesnt start to play videos when Im on home wifi. Recently Ive had trouble with the app playing videos only when Im at home on my wifi.  It wont allow me to play it until I turn wifi off and the moment I use my phone data it will play them.  It may have to do with me being linked with YouTube with my phone and two TVs in the house via wifi.. Problem only started two updates ago please fix
THIS IS THE BEST WATCHING APP EVER. Like you can watch any video you like and its so fun to do Please DOWNLOAD and also it is so perfect that you know it and can watch it on browser or app but I normally watch it app AND IT IS SO AMAZING and you can watch every video YES So Please go on your Phone and DOWNLOAD
Info. I use tube for a particular information search giving me a visual format which is engaging and easy to absorb and digest
"Does not save watch history when watching on WiFi. I noticed this issue for years now, when you are using the App on WiFi the videos watch will not save in your watch history. When I am on 4G (Cellular Data) it will. Funny thing is this problem doesnt occur when I use YouTube using the Chrome app for iOS"
Utube. I enjoy this app but I get tired of seeing will subscribe to this app or take a survey n Im not going to do either one bc I dont feel I should do that if I just wanted to watch something on here n I only watch certain videos on here n if there is something I need to watch from another place that I have to come here to watch it n thats what have to do but another than that Im not paying to watch or anything n if I have to quit using this app to enjoy watching videos on here I will delete your app off my phone before I will pay to enjoy anything on your app thanks
Love all the information. Fantastic app
Low quality instinct is what Id call it. My videos automatically play in 360p every time. It loads in data saver every time. There must be a highest quality option that plays in that quality every time unless you press otherwise in order for this review to change
"Excellent Resource. You tube is an amazing resource. It has everything you could think of. It has interesting stories, recipes, news, Bible study, health information including from physicians. Video presentation makes it so much more personal and interesting. I watch it more than TV"
Fix the channel not loading problem. So its happening to everyone i think when they try going to see their channel videos it wont load and even tho i turn off and on internet or data or if i exit and get back in YouTube it still happens how i know its with everyone is cause its happening with my aunt and my cousin as well
Dead App STOP DELETING. This app is dead and a scam to steal your info. I have been waiting for it to load for 10 minutes and it just wont. I have reported it to the FBI and Google. Fake app. Dead and steals your info
Excelente. Me encanta ver sus videos. Encuentro de todo lo que considero como apoyo informativo personal y académico. Gracias
"Why certain functions. Why can I queue videos when casting but why cant I do the same watching it on a personal device, please address"
"My favorite app. Love the freedom to watch what I want whenever I like. Amazing space for inspiring people to share their knowledge, talent and thoughts. I cant believe how much Ive learned in the past two years and it continues to surprise me with incredible new channels and contents Id never find on my own"
Malware. As soon as I deleted the app I stoped getting scam phone calls. They give our info to that that country with the squinty eyes and no freedom
THIS IS ANNONOYING. I love this app but the thing is when l am on private mode and l Close my phone it makes me go to my Old Account so l have to re-download it But over all good app.
Not enough private. data is collected by application
"Couldnt save video data. Its fairly self explanatory. Whenever i try to upload a video, it keeps saying couldnt save video data and i cant upload. FIX THIS"
I love it until. I really really love this app only thing I dont like is when its time to pay your bill the it keep buffing and the data slow down and make it take along time to play the video
"Surprisingly Bad. It is simply incredible that a multi billion dollar company can make an app that works this poorly. Most of the time when I go to control my Apple TV through my iPad, the UI is completely locked up. The only way to fix it is to first force quit the app, then find and reopen it, and finally reconnect to the Apple TV. This app has so many ways to accidentally access this failure state where the UI is completely unresponsive that I simply cannot remember and avoid them all. They constantly release updates that make superficial changes to the UX that nobody asked for while neglecting to actually make the app work correctly by fixing the many app-breaking bugs"
"Very poor user experience. This app constantly changes resolution of videos whilst on mobile data from preset data saver mode to high resolution.For a 3 minute SD video its not uncommon to get a 6 minute HD ad, in a language I do not understand.I wish there were a decent app that respected the user, this is not the case here.Ridiculous unwanted data consumption.arseholestrytoblocknicknames"
Fun Watching. Always good information
Information. It can also be used to teach
"If you dont have it, give it a go. Goods:Its very entertaining if youre a bit bored and just feel like lounging about and watching some of your fav shows summarised into a 15 mins vid. Theres also very inspiring people on the platform and anyone ca. become a content creator. Barely any glitches and works well with mobile phone data. It also makes you verify your age in case of any inappropriate viewings to younger peopleBads:Some weird videos sometimes pop up on your recommendations, however, steer clear from them and you wont have a problem"
Someone. Does not let me download but when I watch it on google its ok
Too many Russian bots. There are too many fake accounts on this platform that are literally designed to cause divisions among different sects of people. Probably stealing users information while theyre at it
Bug fixes?????. More like user collected data applied for every update is priority and less bug fixes
Awesome app. Plz no ads I hate ads I like watching Spy Ninjas with the Peaceful day :)
Bug. YouTube is a great app but now whenever I try to watch any thing it crashes so I had to lose all the data.Overall a good app
"Awful, unnecessary changes. Why do you keep changing the most pointless things. I dont want to have to select the quality every single time I open a video just give me the old menu back. There was nothing wrong with it so stop trying to fix it. It screws over anyone who has limited data plans when I select 144p so I can listen and go back an hour later and see the app has decided to show me Ive selected 144p and continues to load and play at 1080p60"
"Info warehouse. Great information on just about any topic,has been a lifesaver at time"
Annoying. You need to work on this your stupid advanced version  How will I be downloading movie and its going to reach 83% boom my data just finished within a tickle of an eyes ma sub and continue with the download  The movies don jump back to 7% after using almost 3G is that not one act of cruelty  And selfishness and thus not the first time  It fo comes up numerous times
"No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture.

Love. I love this app because you can watch anything and for kids it isnt inappropriate
Public Library of Our Time. Thanks for the access to the worlds information.  I hope your platform will always remain open and free
"Poor connection. Im next to my router, Im getting 500mbps down because I have a fast WiFi, yet YouTube videos just dont load. I need to switch to data which is just 76 down to watch YouTube"
"Premium Accounts. I am disappointed and puzzled as to why, when paying for a premium account, one cannot download AND save the video to a stick?  Maybe this could be explained?  The stick is for my own personal enjoyment and no one elses.Thank you litigui1"
You Tube : Handy and Useful Information. The best self help info and entertainment source in the world.***6 Stars would be more Appropriate***
I cant post. Every time I cant post its on pervite I put on public it said error saving data
Good info. Wonderful. Accumulation of information
THIS IS ANNONOYING. I love this app but the thing is that when l am on private mode and l Close my iPad it makes me go to my School Account so l have to re-download
"Invasion of privacy??. Asked for access to my microphone after the latest update for SEARCHING and RECORDING VIDEOS, then recorded 3 solid minutes of me watching a video. Turned access off, the whole app crashed. Sketchy af"
videos wont load & crashes. please fix for ios . havent been able to watch in the youtube app because it keeps not loading videos . no its not my wifi nor data . its the app as i tested this out . just pretty much annoying because i enjoy youtube for my music . fix ASAP
"YouTube, please fix this. Ok so, I was going on my channel today, and then it says that I have no internet connection, even though Im at full connection, so I tap the thing, and then my vids pop up, it does the same thing when I go to my videos, playlists, and about page, and it even does it with different channels, except I cant get into there channel at all (I dont mean hack there channel) but the only thing that works is getting into there vid, or subbing, so ya, plz fix this youtubeBut this is an incredible app"
Youtube. This is an incredible app the best its entertaining fun to watch
Lost my data. I had this app for years but today I went in and lost all of my data even my accs
YouTube. I love this app it so incredible
Love. You tube is amazingcuz you can be on it. Whatch challenges Learn hacks And see new apps and download them So yes you tube is fantastic
Its not a good app. Fix your notifications. I dont need to watch a video to see what other video my favorite channel posted
Uhh whats happening. So I just updated YouTube and now not a SINGLE video will load. And this is only for me my brother is also having the same problem I don&#39;t want you no data and nothing worked and YouTube please fix this as soon as possible because I need to make more YouTube videos it because it&#39;s not even letting me do that
"I cant sign in. Every time I try to sign in on my laptop it says we are sorry, but you do not have access to Youtube.  Please contact your Organization Administrator for access.  But Im using my personal account so there is no administrator to contact.  And its working perfectly fine on my phone, just not my laptop.  How do I fix this???"
The best app. This is a great appYou get all the information you want from millions of you tubers and channels.So download this app and you might have a crush on it.
"Changing Video Quality is just a hassle now. I had no issue with these video settings before. I would love to just choose one resolution to play my videos and keep it at that. Personally, Id watch on 1080p/60 when available. But sometimes videos load or drop down to 720p or 480p. When I want to switch it back, Im left with vague options (which is new), like high quality or data saver, which I dont exactly know what that does for me. The specific resolution options are hidden under Advanced even though the option is so basic. Revert the change or at least make it a toggle option"
Stop sharing what I look up. You are invading my privacy. Check title. It sums everything up
What is going on. Ive had this app for 6 years and its been great Id get notifications on time and my recommended videos would be new or popular videos. Now its just recommending me videos Ive already watched and or dont want to watch. Its also giving me notifications for subscribes channels days after Ive watched the video or the videos been posted this app is slowly turning into Internet Explorer
Very good. I like the app. It works well even after Im way over my data usage. I also like that when you download it you can see the rating the show is 2 star. They are not being greedy and showing only a 5 star
"Painful to watch now. If you dont pay a subscription to get rid of the commercials, forget about watching videos anymore"
"Every single update makes the app worse. Its incredible how with every update, the developers manage to make the interface LESS intuitive and the algorithm for recommendations even dumber. Its like they WANT people to hate it"
The best app to watch videos. This is the best app to watch videos on it has everything that you can think off it even has music that you can play and video games to watch. You should download this app NOW You will be able to watch whatever you want
Update. I hate that the comments are at the top now. It randomly happened when I closed the app and then I go back on and its all gross and wonky. I also preferred the smaller more list like way that videos were organized underneath the video that is currently being watched. Now its big and I cant just quickly scan through videos to watch next. This was a bit of an annoying update that shouldve been left up to personal preference
You have it all in one place. So many questions hard to find answers until you came with not only answers but demonstrated the information and showing how to use the information that is what is great about your service I am an older person but finding how to do something new to me is a lot easier when I tune into your video instructions and needless to say I enjoy the music of old rock and roll. Soul by singers no and bands in their best times thank you
"personal issue. so i watch a lot of youtube and so my watch later list is often rather long and the issue i find myself with is the minor issue of arrangement. id like to be better able to switch the order in which to have them categorised, so i can have a sting of music and then separate perhaps by creator. Otherwise this is a great app, just me being picky"
Removing the dislike button was a bad idea. Now scammers and people who want to cause havoc can post fake tutorials and steal info from people without anyone figuring it out and there is no way for people to know plus the algorithm just shoves those vids to the front anyway so this was a horrible change to me
You tube. I love it.  I use it all the time for  information
NEVER works with mobile data. Even when every other app does. So annoying
"Racist to Europeans. BY FORCING THEM TO SHOW THEIR PRIVATE ID BEFORE THEY WATCH A FKING AGE-RESTRICTED VIDEO, FK YOU SUSAN YOU SJW B-TCH "
"Bad. This app is not good anymore. They got rid of the dislike button, so now you cannot give them feedback or advice to make better videos"
Great but. Its a great app I can watch all my favorite YouTubers (Aphmau and skeppy) but not getting all my notifications. So could you please fix this
Not letting me in. I try going into the app and it says this app is no longer shared with you. I dont want to re-download it because it will delete all my data
Best app for anything you can watch porn isnt that amazing. Best app for anything you can watch porn isnt that amazing
No more advertising. Go back to NO ads. This was a personal place for people to enjoy real life events. The middle class gets screwed again. Now its all about advertising and money

Bugs?. Really recently like in the past few days YouTube wont load videos if you go not even that far into the feed it might just be a bug for me (iPhone se) on WiFi and data it happens
"Does not play video in Lock Screen or in background with premium subscription. I pay monthly for the premium, and it doesnt even play in the background with audio only. Eats up all my data. Please fix this issue. Also does not play in the background when using the google map navigation app"
YouTube is the best I like watching the spy ninjas. The best cwc
Hi. This is a great app to keep track of everything anyone is doing
New update breaks app. None of the videos will load on my cellular data and wifi and to top it off I didnt even update it myself it forced itself to update
"Cant even use it now. So I tried to listen to my music with my data and it wont load youtube, so I go to another app to see if it works and youtube was the only one not working"
Quality preferences. I dont want labels like auto higher. Give option of resolution 480p or 360p for permanent preference rather data saver. I like this feature but let us choose specific resolution for wifi and data
"The Hell is This New 'Update'. What the hell happened? before, I could watch all the videos I wanted, and now? now not one video will load. why the hell? I tried redownloading, turning off and on my wi-fi, my data, even my bluetooth, none of it worked. why? I might as well use YouListen as an alternative"
"Not doing it. Wish I could say this was a great app, but cant since you cant create an account without having a gmail or creating one. I had a gmail account with my old Samsung phone and it was worst in getting spam emails, or theyd put emails I subscribed to into spam"
"Hacker has been found and Im worried for others. I think this is an amazing place but recently it come to my attention their are hackers going after young childrens accounts (gacha) Ive tried to report them to you but for some reason I dont have the option to, their name is Sherbase12 and Im very worried for the younger gacha creators who are being targeted by these people, please can you look into getting them removed as I feel its becoming unsafe for the young creatorsEDIT THERES ANOTHER HACKER NAMED BRAD GARLINHOUSE He has already hacked one channel and sold it"
"Best app. I like you tube because News are up to date.It is an easy app to useIt has so much information to Lear how to cook, how to do it yourself jobs, it is one of the best apps available as you information, on anything you want to know.  I enjoy  and like this app"
"Quality options are even more bugged now. First off, I hate the change to resolution. I always watch at 480p but now if I try data saver it will be 360p every time, and even if I manually change it, it does not carry over... At least it did... Well now data saver just defaults to 720p. Everyone in the house blames me for using all the bandwidth even though I never even streamed HD, but now I dont even have a choice... How did you even break that?"
Put it back. Put notifications back on the bottom and get rid of the go live button. nobody uses that
"So much to learn. History,DIY,alternate living styles, gardening; all of my interests covered. Now if you could just move all the soft porn disguised as Yoga, exercise ,womens track and field to some other venue it would be much better"
"Video Quality. The new way to change video quality sucks, it should be part of the app settings to choose quality depending on wifi or data and while playing the video it should just give you the measurements as before"
Why?. Why is it that you still can&#39;t add new videos to your watch later list from a new notification?
I want to. Honestly I want to like being a part of the Facebook community because everyone I care about is there and it is faster than mail and cheaper than gas to visit but quit honestly its making me feel like if my friends and family saw my stupid way of life because of it Id be embarrassed I cover my sin easy but ppl still see it because they know without Facebook Id be at their house or in my community participating with the activities I know I love like my kids and baseball or football My friends and family miss me Im sure and Im thinking of leaving to go back and see them in person and fix my mind away from this virtual reality Its not my job like it is some How can I save my memories?Dont take this personal
Amazing Best App Ever You Should Totally Download. Millions of videos to watch its like I can watch anything I want
"Video Quality Selector. I love the app, but they need to change the video quality selector back to what they had it. Not the whole advanced, data saver, etc. thing that they have going on now"
DOWNLOAD YOUTUBE NOW. Pls download this app it has every video in the world it has music movies games well you watch games download it now or Ill hack you and download the app and get a horror game on y. Phone computer iPod tablet what ever your on just download the app I know if your still reading this if you are becouse cmon you would not know about this part DOWNLOAD NOW OR GET HACKEDPeace
Enjoy Watching and making videos. Learning and sharing information. Yes
Steals views. Stole about 60M views from a music video trying to break a record. 
Whyyyy. Why is there even a comment history even a thing like. I dont want it on my yt page its weird and is really absolutely just an invasion of privacy. Its weird why is it even a thing 
Great videos. Watch some almost every day.  Both entertainment and info
Newest update. Took away quality selection and says go to setting but only allows you to select 360 p as the minimum I dont have wifi so this eats up a lot more data when it used to always be set on 180 cause I listen and not really watch please bring back the old system only made the app worse and now I gotta find some place else to listen to podcasts or just people talk while I do work
. No way to use Picture in Picture and even worse they hacked it on the website to force you out of it when you open Picture in Picture. Shame
"Pertinent information from so many varied and interesting areas . I love history, smooth jazz, food, women and life. Google is always a great source of information but this site can deliver so much more in greater detail.Thanx You Tube ,Wm C Duff "
"BEST THING EVER. I love this app, Logdotzip is my Personal favourite and its SO ENTERTAINING that I love it"
Amazing App. Its the best app to watch stuff and I also love subscribing to my favorite youtubers
"Versus Hollywood?. Omg, Id So much rather spend my time watching homegrown personal Real Life adventures than the fake dream lives Hollywood spends billions creating trying to pretend and make us think is real life  Just please dont get sucked down the toilet hole of fake conspiracy baloney.  Watch real people, real lives, like your own"
"Errors. Ive used to YouTube app for over 4 years, I was fine after the comments were moved and the the font thinned out, but after this update, if I click on a video, I can watch the video but cant see: the title, description, comments, and the recommended videos below. All I get is Error Tap to retry or something around those lines, for the past week. Ive tried turning WiFi on and off and using cellular data, put I cant see anything below the video Im watching. Im watching on IPhone X. Please reply and let me know whats going on"
fire your ui designer. what is this..why do i have to navigate through an rediciulous amount of menues to change the simplyest settings. ps: change low data mode to 480p. if you want to save data get rid of your too many ad&#39;s
Dont really like this last update. I used to be able to keep better track of the new videos that I had not watched yet and now I have lost the ability to do so and it is really frustrating now
"Library not showing. Noticed after ios15 update, YouTube library not showing if data connection not available, shows only if connected to internet via Wi-Fi or network data. Not sure its new iOS update or YouTube app bug"
"Exo don't fight the feeling music video viewers. Please stop stealing viewers from exo don&#39;t fight the feeling music video , stop stealing our views"
Advertising. Please stop all these adverts between music tracks
"No Vaccine Censorship. In a free country, you have to make up your own mind based on a lot of data. Misinformation may not be misinformation"
"Buggier every release. Gross data usage. My old negative review was deleatedThe good is very good. The irritating bugs get more plentiful each release - none fixed - it just amazes me. A couple of the gross ones:No-Preview selector does not work. Videos will automatically start and play for hours with no sound and not allow iPhone to autolock - later pick up the phone and see the video was playing silently on an unlocked phone.  Previews are running automatically as I scroll, even though no-preview is selected. I no longer watch youtube movies - others use a lot less data with far far greater qualityI like the independent channels - but really only game in town for now"
Tailor Made. Always enjoy my exploration in life w YouTube.  Offering in alignment with my history I appreciate the feed and direction I have created and it supports.  Incredible tool becoming more and more tailor made for me
"Current update has broken resolution settings. Listening to music on mobile at work via YouTube just became unviable.  Their video resolution settings have a mind of their own.  I had it on Data saver and it literally jumped from 360p to 480p, and the Advanced Setting would only bring it down to 360 when I put it at 144p.  For someone who is running a limited mobile data plan that charges an extra $10 for additional data, these are potentially expensive bugs for the inattentive. Effectively broke a feature that never need fixed or complications to begin with"
Amazing . This is an amazing app first of all. Because you can use it on your phone but the annoying thing it wastes so much battery and Data 
"Thought less about a man. Great medium for personal interviews and a face to face open conversation. When people understand each other, respect grows. Continue to make greater content. YouTube @raqueliza"
Great for learning anything. I use it for tutorials and information. Also fun
Not so great. They dont steal views from blackpink and crap and congratulate them on Instagram when they get certain mount of views. They think its okay to steal views because they think its acceptable. They should honestly leave view counts alone and this would not be a big issue. This looks bad on their behalf and makes them look racist
Thanks. Whats not to like anything I want to access I can access usually to get information thank you God bless
"Not loading on lte data. Recently in the past few weeks Ive noticed Youtube is not loading with my lte data. I dont mean the videos are buffering I mean the entire interface will not load. I can click through the tabs and use the search bar, but no videos or other options like history show up. When I use wifi it will load, and if I am coming off of wifi straight to data it will work. The issue is if I open youtube up straight from data. The issue is not signal strength or anything since I can load youtube through safari, but the app itself. I dont know what current update did this, but it has made my time with the app abysmal"
"Overall Great. Overall great, but wish there was a simple function to attach personal notes to video (for personal use or for sharing with others) and/or share videos at specific timestamps across multiple platforms"
YT. Love this App watch it more than regular TV So much information
"600+ Downloads disappeared from a known bug. Downloads disappeared out of nowhere 600+ songs gone. While still taking up space on my phone. Support was nice, but their only solution was to reinstall the app (wipe all the YouTube data off my phone) and search each individual song to re-download them. Three years of creating that list of downloads only to have them disappear to a bug thats been known and reported for the past 3-4 years. Extremely frustrating considering Ive been paying for premium for 3 years. This is the equivalent to playing a game for three years and having all your data wiped from a random bug the developers ignored. "
It is awesome glad to have it. YouTube is the best app I ever had it is amazing and incredible I use YouTube literally every day. I love this app
"Worst bug of them all. Dear Youtube I want to talk about probably the worst bug on your system, whenever I switch my phone to Data or wifi it causes a bug that makes ANY video on your platform not work. Instead of playing the video the bug just makes the video loading and loading and nothing else. I tried to switch to another video but it keeps loading as well. I trying restarting the app and that didnt work, So you wanna know how I fixed it? BY RESTARTING MY INTIRE PHONE EVERY-TIME THIS HAPPENS So youtube will please fix this dumb glitch"
"Its good. Some of the stuff on here isnt for kids, so monitor what you kids are watching. Also, subscribe to ChunkyDaWaffleCat on YouTube."
"Amazing. I love this app, it lets me watch anything that is appropriate for me, I love watching gacha videos and everything pretty much, just one tiny thing. Since Im on a phone, the notification of a video comes up as a full screen, I dont know why but Im not asking you to fix that Awesome game&lt;3"
"Download video doesnt work. With the new update, i cannot watch video without internet. The app shows that I have completed downloaded the videos. But when I am outside without data, videos simply wouldnt play. The download feature is a disaster and nightmare for users"
Bring back the like and dislike ratio. You dont have to show us the dislike counter but Atleast bring back the ratio data.. it is very helpful and its difficult to choose proper videos without it
"Great app. Very good go to app when I am looking for a video. Lots of good information to learn about and get a lot of new pieces of info out of. I watch this material with my wife, mom, daughter, mom in-law, father in-law and we all benefit from it Thank you YouTube"
Amazing great app highly recommend it. Ok Ive used this app for a long long time now its amazing and all but things have changed and its either gotten better or worse but the way u have to take ur time to go all the way through like maybe  a few steps to change ur pfp or channel name but overall Im not rlly complaining. I created my channel about 11 months ago and Ive gotten no hate YouTube is an amazing app and incredible for knowlage Videos on here can get interesting and amusing 10/10 and 5 stars
Malware. As soon as I deleted the app I stoped getting scam phone calls. They give our info to that that country with the squinty eyes and no freedomUpdate: yup still run by total hacks
Cool app. I love this app my favourite YouTuber is jelly spy ninjas and mr best yep
needs fixing. since the newest update videos will freeze when I try to make them fullscreen and they take longer to load more often (even when I have wifi and my data on) then they used to making it a lot harder for me to want to watch anything on this app
"Hey. There is another secured method used in hacking any cell phone remotely and that is the use of a private investigator, it has to be private and confidential. Now I know a tech support guy who works as my investigators, whenever aany of my family travels or steps out without informing me where, I simply use the service rendered by  alexandrahackexpert @ gmail .com  with the assurance of getting enough information of where she is and who she communicates with at the moment"
No title. This is a good app to watch all your favorite peaple you can have YouTube tv YouTube for kids YouTube on a tv what more can you ask for and the is millions of videos that are out there that you can watch it is free there is also YouTube music personal opinion but I love this app if I go to the apps that I mostly use YouTube would have like 2 or 3 or more hours of watch time you should down load it :)
Still experiencing not loading home page. Really recently like in the past few days (2 weeks) YouTube wont load videos if you go not even that far into the feed it might just be a bug for me (iPhone se) on WiFi and data it happens (repost)
Watch history was deleted. I have videos that I have watched going back January 2020 and I noticed looking through my watch history that only the videos from last week (July 29) to now (today) are in my watch history. What happened to my videos I watched going all the way back to January 2020?I didnt manually delete them and I do NOT have them set to auto delete in my Google Activity data and personalization.Process of elimination: Its a bug within YouTube where my watch history was deleted. Idk. Yall need to fix this. Im sure Im not the only one
Best app ever. Not only do you get to watch videos of your choice but you can make videos.  I personally thinks this app should be 5 star but then again.  This app is amazing it runs fine and I never lag ( but I do when Im on data). This app truly is amazing this needs to be 5 star
Takes to long to load. To many ads and takes way to long to load even with data and WiFi
"Need sort, categorize and renaming functions for subscriptions. Need a simple capability to categorize, sort and rename  sites that are saved within the subscription function.   Difficult now searching through long list of subscriptions or running a search to find specific site.   Also, no capability to group similar subjects.   Still, YT one of the best sites, but an upgrade with new data base search, categorize, sort, renaming would make it more useful"
Free Tv. Great information on free tv I was amazed at all the info out there
"A few problems. Its the best way to get information But, recently, they took away the dislike feature.  Also, now, you need to click on a button just to see the comments You used to be able to just scroll down.Pls get rid of the update.Otherwise, you can make a career out of it and its a good thing for Information, entertainment, and blogging"
WORST APP EVER. Only the first 5-10 seconds of all of my videos load and then stop. App seems to always be lagging and bogged down. Maybe if there wasnt so much back-end on the app spying on me and using him up all of that bandwidth maybe it would work
complaint about collecting  personal information. youtoube did collect my personal and business details
"I cant play videos. Wont let me play videos, tried with wifi and with my celular data, still didnt let me. I also closed the app many times"
I love YT Premium I love the fact I dont watch any of the annoying commercials. Having the premium upgrade to avoid the commercial is incredible I also like the option to download the videos to view offline
Home Project Videos. They are INCREDIBLE  I have saved SO MUCH money searching and using Videos on YT to avoid spending more to replace the part or service
THIS SO GOOOD TO WATCH. I love this app and I can to subscribe me YouTuber hehe
Crashes... Constantly. I might give this app 2 stars if it could manage to go at least a full day without shutting down. Lose my signal for 2 seconds... crashGet a phone call... crashLook at it funny... CRASHWhat the hell are you spending your money on google? Other than invading my privacy Not writing better code thats for sureUpdate: Stop to write a review... Craaaaasssshhh
"No Apple Watch app. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone. Also, ability to add to watch later list or hide videos with left and right swipes. Most of the time videos gets stuck in waiting to download but never download. Finally, we need an option to filter out videos on the subscription and home feed pages that are already on our watch later list. I dont get why I would be suggested videos that are already on my playlist or that I have already watched"
"Kind of garbage. This app is borderline incompatible with apple, but that has been a common theme for the past 10 years if anyone has been paying attention to it.  The 15 seconds skip back/ahead has been removed years ago, ads and functions frequently block the videos, and access personal playlists is either not possible or difficult to find"
YouTube the Bomb. I think YouTube is So fun because you can watch so many videos I recommend you guys trying to watch Rebecca Zamolo and the spy ninjas because they have some really good videos and if you do watch Rebecca Zamolo make sure you shut him out her out for being pregnant congratulations
Poorly thought out. New app update where notifications say X uploaded 3 videos  means you have to open one of the videos to see what has been uploaded. This automatically starts using (mobile) data. You need to change this so you can see what videos are available before opening them
My watch history. For some reason my youtube watch history refuses to update and i have try everything to fix it
Election fraud info needed. I am from Canada but I am very interested in the United States election issues. I was hoping to get more uncensored information about election fraud or potential election fraud. Why not just let people post information and let us the viewer decide if its true or false?
Big problem for me. so every im watching a video and i click out of the app and come back It gets rid of my video i was watching so i have to search it up again so frustrating
Best app ever. App is incredible without mention insane awesome videos on here. Over 2 billion people use this app
Revulsion. It is an easy way to find information and you can Watch entertain
Dislike buttons. I think I should install other apps to watch videos this app isnt the same
"Too much ads. Its incredible how much ads this app has now. I used to sleep to music on a playlist, but now Im forced to stay awake to skip the 2 minute ads. If I let the ads play, theres a second ad right after. Its gotten unbearable over the last few days. It never used to be like this"
"Pretty awesome. Dude this app is too good to be true. Its incredible. Just wow. But.... I do wish they arent any more clickbaiters. Anyway, keep it up"
WORST APP IN THE WORLD. You should honestly just go to Rumble its literally 9999999999999 times BETTER YOUTUBE WILL STEEL YOUR INFORMATION AND SELL IT FOR PROFIT
Disappointed. Not again YouTube why now I really hate this verify my age thing its absolutely ridiculous stupid your trying to steel peoples personal information and its rude and not allowed and I cant even watch a top gear video you should really ashamed of your selfs
intermittent no internet connection. Since the recent updates. Slow loading when the app is launched. Just gray tiles in place of the video in the main screen. I tried to use Safari tor YouTube just to give the benefit of the doubt. But YouTube on Safari worked fine. I was using the same mobile data connection
Coco melon Diss track being removed. WhYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy what sin have we done to have this much of a consequence
You tube. I think you tube is a really great app you get to watch diy videos you can watch life hacks you can watch your fave YouTuber vids this app is amazing I love this app so much
Ask App Not to Track & Picture in Picture. these mf do weekly updates but I dont see anything different as to what has been updated. Premium subscriber &amp; still no PiP. Google is the worst company &amp; they think that theyre slick still havent asked us not to be tracked
"Feedback. Asked to leave feedback...need better filters, repeat suggestions come up even though have stated previously that I am not interested. Also keep getting watched videos as choices. Should not come up once you watch it. Aslso suggestions should not come from subscribed channels, you are going to watch them anyways. Thank you"
Amazing App. I really like this app because its great and good where are you can watch videos and subscribe to your favorite users
Good app. Readily available information. Reliability
"No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture. Also, ability to add to watch later list with one click like on the desktop website. Most of the time app gets stuck in waiting to download but never download. Finally, we need an option to filter out videos on the subscription and home pages that are already on our watch later list"
"Too much ads. Its incredible how much ads this app has now. I used to sleep to music on a playlist, but now Im forced to stay awake to skip the 2 minute ads. If i let the ads play, theres a second ad right after. Its gotten unbearable over the last few days"
Great information. This is a great way to get info on things you want to know more about
My email address. I installed your ap on my amazon fire and you sold my email info now the spam and phone calls wont stop so thanks. Ive tried stopping it to no avail. So please erase me from your system thanks
"iTunes Music. This is about as great a selection of anything you are interested in. Im having a bit of trouble with knowing if I dare to try very hard to share some songs and where I can and cant.I just tried to share a song about a persons pet dying and replacing him with a dog from the pound.I couldnt send it so after two tries I quit.I read the rules and there is so much to take in,and a little lengthy so I dont want to and dont know if its even allowed anymore. But if you only keep it personal I guess ok. I dont know. Great app tho"
"What an incredible resource. Slickly designed, easy to use, and a great resource. I wish though they would stop pop-up pestering me to subscribe..£17.00 per month is too much"
My personal opinion. The best app ever
"fixed Nothing. you havent fixed; the not interested in this video button, the not interested in this channel, dont like this video, not interested in recommendations based on this channel.either you cannot fix these things or you refuse to which is it?got it,well tune into your recommendations? what a laughand you have the nerve to try to sell me this? do you also try to sell week old newspapers at twice the original price to disabled veterans?why are these thing ignored perpetually?"
"I really miss the option for videos to buffer. When I go through the effort to select a specific video quality, I Do Not Want the video to start playing at a lower quality for five seconds before it fails to play the video any further. I would vastly prefer an option to preload and buffer the video at a higher resolution when in a low data area over being stuck in stop and go 144p video. I can wait five minutes for a video to buffer enough that I can view it uninterrupted at a higher quality. Further I would like an option for a minimum buffer time so that I can guarantee the video wont start playing and then stuttering five or even thirty seconds later. When I have stable access to internet the app is great, but I would really love good low-data options such as the above being added in"
Bring back dislike button and ratio. So dumb to get rid of the dislikes - that provided tons of info
About the video by Rkchadda. UTUBE is excellent as I can post my personal videos and private videos and Zi am very happy as my videos are very short and some are educational and some are just for laugh only
"Asinine video quality change. Add this to the other reviews complaining about the asinine change to the video quality selection. The new interface is cumbersome, unnecessary, and doesnt work (i set it as 144p to conserve data and it still shows 360p). Some genius probably proposed this change to make himself seem relevant"
PLZ HELP. I dont know what happened but with the number new update that happened two days ago update 17.04.3 whats this update I can no longer use it without being connected to my houses Internet wont work with my data and I dont know if its something that I did or if its the update but this is the first time this is ever happened to me with an update
Love you tube. Im an information junkie but also use discernment with what I watch. I found a video today that had some valuable information I needed. So thank you for service.
"FIX THIS BUG. For the last week now im having swap back and forth back data and wi-fi to load a video. The connection is perfect on both, the page will always load right away and even buffer a couple seconds of the video and then it stopsEverything else loads immediately but the video will not buffer. And then if I switch to wifi or back to data it starts loading a little and then maybe stops and then switch back again and it loads more. THIS IS NOT A CONNECTION ISSUE. Ive reset my phone ive tested other apps on both my wifi and data and everything else works perfectly fine except youtube. So please, fix this annoying $#%@ing bug"
Its great but. Its a incredible app the problem is there are just way to many ads and its so anoyying and the loading times just take way too long
I enjoy it even more now Ive found mrballen. Anyone who is a fan of the strange dark and mysterious has got to check out this guy cos hes new-ish within the last couple of years. To YouTube anyway. Absolutely every vid has got the same thousands of comments saying anyone come across a mrballen vid by accident and now cant stop binge watching . I hope hes being sponsored like YouTube do with make up influencers etc because he is the only person I can listen to about the types of sometimes tragically sad events without feeling almost dirty afterwards. I dont know what to say except he is an incredible storyteller and total natural on camera - I know Im not the only one who feels like hes talking to me. I love your channel mrballen.. I cant wait to get my own mrballen merchandise. This is a review of mrballens channel rather than YouTube - the adds are a pain and YT take down content as they like - any conspiracies about covid/  9/11 for example
Hacking. Someone stole my account info and closed my account.I tried to reach out to you but nobody cared to reply
Great app. Tons of information
"Problem with latest update. Ever since I last updated my app, whenever I minimise the app (for example to check a message on another app) when I reopen to continue watching my video, the video just appears completely black but theres still audio.Also, my mobile does not recognise I am watching a video so after some time the screen dims and the mobile locks as it would due to inactivity.I have to completely close the YouTube app and open it again to make it be able to play videos once more.Im using an iPhone 11Pro 64GB.The issue occurs both under Wi-Fi and mobile data"
are you still watching. please and i mean please get rid of that are you still watching thing its annoying and is no doubt the worst update yall have made
Stupid adds. Steeling user data And still adds are never relevant
"What Happened to the Subscribe Future???. I Love the App But the Subscribe Future is Broken Well Broken for Me the Subscribe Future Broke When I Got Hacked. I Managed to Log Back in My Account And I Noticed that Some of the YouTubers I Was Subscribed to. Umm How Do I Explain. It Unsubscribed Me to Some of the YouTubers I Was Subscribed to Like For Example I Was Subscribed to Laurenzside And it Unsubscribed Me From Her But I Managed to Subscribe Back. It Also Unsubscribed Me From SSSniperWolf, AzzyLand, And etc. Please Fix the Subscribe Future"
It give you feed up and information the history and all the. All the kind topic will be provided through the UTube
Spy ware. App monitors and stores sound bytes When not opened and usedWhich they share with everyone
"Pakleader4. I know you do have control over some content. But trying to distinguish the real educational info vs copy cats that are getting people hurt with this bush craft stuff has got me really upset. I have been a real military infantry man and learned real survival skills from Cub Scouts, to the Explorers program (one above Eagle Scout) sponsored by the United States army reservists. Veterans who have been life saving scenarios and it pains me to see fake people just wanting 15 mins of fame and copying others yet making more mistakes in the process that get a person killed. But tracking down different equipment has been helpful. Thank you"
"Gone downhill. They have fallen so far from grace, terrible moderation, spam is rampant The only reason they are still afloat is because there is no real competitor to them. Almost 10 years, really didnt anything on this platform other than watch videos, like videos, and make private music playlists for myself and somehow, my account was suspended for spam and scam and they refused to reverse the decision cant access my subscriptions, cant access my playlists, cant watch videos literally cant see anything they made their money off of me, and threw me out"
"NO. This app is so inappropriate. I feel as though its an invasion of privacy. They said a really bad word on one of the kids videos, they said Frick My kids are 17 and 15 practically a baby and I dont want them exposed to this. This type of content is almost fatal exposing your kids to this. And people always yell at me saying oh well theyre almost adults I dont care. I w would like if if I could speak to your manager"
By far the most unstable app on my phone. crashes every few hours...failed network connections (TCP sessions stall constantly; no other streaming app does this; doesnt matter whether LTE or WiFi)...frequently fails to remember what video was in progress upon stalled sessions...many stalls require a hard app kill to get any vids to stream (no other app does this)...notifications extremely unreliable...ad preferences regarding offensive material and fraudulent products not honored; the same ads keep showing up despite being flagged...frequently freezes while attempting to force an ad into the streamThe only reason I use this app is because its bandwidth is zero rated vs data cap
"Ms. (REMZUL). I love watching videos on YOU TUBE .The info I get is the best , reliable &amp; entertaining news that any one could watch . Sometimes instead of watching  CHANNELS  ON TV I just switch to my I PHONE every morning when I wake up . I even dont get out of my bedroom just to watch the videos for 3-4 hours , next thing I know I missed my breakfast. I just love You TUBE so much"
"Recently Problem. I love is app, but just recently I been have a problem when Im trying to watch videos. It would pop up An Error Occurred so I thought my wifi was having issue, I reset my WiFi and tried again. The same things popped up An Error OccurredSo I restarted my phone, my powering it off for a bit. When I powered it back on and tried to watch a video An Error Occurred popped up again.. I dont know if my phone because I tried on my iPad and it having the same problem. So I created other account to see if it was my account. An Error Occurred popped up again. I would to whats happening, idk if YouTube data base is down or an update is needed"
The best app ever invented by far. This app is beneficial and useful in many different ways. It has a wide range of videos and information. My experience with this app is that its like a personal helper and entertains me at the same time. Its grate for people who live alone and need some help or entertainment as they are all alone. Therefore I give this app 5 starts
Review. So far Ive not had any of the things that I look for blocked but I hear a blocking going on against conservatives I hope that is not the case as a whole used to has been a great tool to me in teaching children and my own personal entertainment and personal life thank you
So no more downloads without paying huh?. This used to be my go to app for everything but I always loved the offline downloads for later where I wean to snow my friends something without data but tada now I have to pay for it I say not
"stupid app. stupid app always starts at 720p, no matter how many million times you set the stupid videos to download at 144p because you are on mobile data"
"Overexposed. Due to YouTubes overexposure, it lacks personal connections. Keep Trying, #stephenthestoryteller"
Loading. I can never load a video I always have to use my data to watch videos
"My Personal Overview of U-Tube. Since having accessed this great volume of information and worldly wonders, I truly believe that my understanding has been awakened withinEverything is available for personal enjoyment and scrutiny, as required by your audience. An invaluable resource for us human beings existing on this earth.        Thank you and keep surprising all of us "
"Watching problems. I have an account and use on me computer and tv but when I try to use it on my phone, it wont let me watch anything not even an add. I mean the stuff wont load to play like suggestions from the video and the button to subscribe and like the stuff will appear but the video will not load. I just want to know how to fix it or if it is a bug that you need to fix"
Yet. personal think this app is amazing but I fell like if your a YouTuber I cant post some of videos from a while ago. And one video I tried to upload and it must up and I still cant upload it. But besides that this app is amazing
"Premium isnt premium. I pay $15 a month to listen to music offline, and with the app closed. The past month or two, despite paying, my downloaded videos just dont work. They buffer, dont work when Im offline, and its easier to use my data which is the exact thing downloading videos is there to prevent. I hope this gets fixed soon, or else Im going to stop paying this subscription"
Great app. I think this a great app to watch when your bored I personal watch this app everyday
"Rubbish asking credit card to approve age. What is this asking credit card for age approval , your app is full with useless advertisements its bad app and bad organisation whoever invented you going to far to ask people personal things to be able to use it Rubish"
"Videos wont load. Ok, everything was good and then my videos wont load. What do I do? PLS I CNAT LIVE WITHOUT YOUTUBE IM DESPERATE. I Tried everything. I deleted YouTube, turned off celular data, restarted my device, everything pls help"
"What will THEY think of next???. Ive been doing art for as long as I can remember and at age 69 ,well Im sure you can imagine. I must admit I have been reluctant to YouTube, mostly because Im very impatient with technology as well as I didnt want my work influenced by the works of other artists. However, my 17 year old granddaughter, who is also an amazing artist, showed me some of the incredible and ingenious works not only being showcased on YouTube but being taught as well. I cant thank her enough and as an aside she also taught me how to maneuver YouTube on my IPad. Look out world cause Im watching"
"Why can I just manual set my resolution quality manually?. Whats with the new update on resolution quality? Why did it change to auto, higher quality, and data saver? All it does is choose the highest resolution or the lowest and auto just goes back and forth depending on your connection. There is nothing in between where I usually set my videos at (720p or 720p @ 60 FPS). You have to press an extra button now to set it to a resolution you want. Go back to the old way just like the desktop version. Im sure if people want to save data they know to lower resolution and if they want high quality they should know to set the quality higher"
Please fix caption settings. Its beyond tedious having to turn on the captions with EVERY VIDEO.What happened to the setting to have it turned on permanently? I feel like this is a personal attack or something
I love YouTub. I could watch spy ninjas on YouTube I could watch anything on YouTube that I want to so I give it a five out of five
Annoying. Takes my data and wants a review
I cant search up I single thing on YouTube and I have 4 bars of service and I have cellular data. I really wish it would work it works one second stops working another second
??????. this app all the sudden gave access to all my information in my pictures saved in my phone and yet never informed me on it
Live the app. I really love this app and I really hate how it lags when I use data then it would not let me livestream which is unfortunate but other than that its amazing app
Personal computers is constantly crashing. In personal computers website is constantly crashing and is very slow

Financial Breakthrough. You should post on  How to win the lotteryStrategies on how to build wealth How to have a personal relation with God
Revert the video resolution selector. One thing thats essential in a good app/software is keeping the number of clicks for a widely used feature to a minimum. I like to select the resolution for all my videos. This dumbed down version may be good to save system resources for your selves or data for users but hiding the resolution options behind an additional click is frustrating
Opinión personal. POR QUÉ TANTA PUBLICIDAD Antes no era así :(
"Fights. You tube has always give me pleasure to watch you can watch what ever you want and its free, now who can beat that no one I know "
Only good on desktop. it keeps crashing and clearing all of my data and subscriptions  this never happens on desktop for me
Watching you tube. Find the whole experience great information education and fun things to watch brill
"Best App. This is a phenomenal app, create your own channel, and maybe earn money, and watch  great videos Download this app"
BEST APP EVER. I love watching videos and think it  is the best app I have ever downloaded
"New update will not allow videos to play on cellular. Dear Google - please fix the most recent update. After updating, the app will not load videos if using cellular data, only wifi. Thanks"
Used up too much data. Contstant update
Pretty good. Pretty good but I wish I could make an account without using a phone number or email even though I have an phone number I bet it would be a bit easier to get my account hacked although its great :D
"Awesome App you need to get it. Ok look this app is AWESOME and I will tell you why,There are so many channels to watch and you can make your ownYou can watch streams,old videos and you can subscribe If you do you can turn on notifications and get all the new videos"
:v. yt deletes views on specific channels for no reason. this messes with accurate data for music awards and isnt fair to the artists
Best app ever. This is the best app I ever had but they should add a track of how much videos you watched in a day
Hi. I recommend this app for all ages but I think the only thing is that kids can watch thing to old for them so I think they should add age groups so kids can't watch inappropriate videos otherwise it a good app for when you are just chilling on the sofa or waiting to get a check up so I think I can say this app gets a 5 stars from me so if you are looking for entertainment you should get this app so you can watch spy ninjas  Carrie walker and thousands more hope you enjoy it as much as I do b
"Video previews are garbage. Bring regular thumbnails back. No way to turn off video previews.They use data that I would rather not use. Half the time they dont even load, and just show grey boxes. How is this better than still thumbnails?"
"Plenty of bugs on most recent iPad. The most annoying, as of Jan 12, 2020, is when you try to reply to comments. More often than not it just freezes. No way to scroll or anything. Poor experience really. Avoid the app and just use the browser. Youll get fewer annoying ads and keep more privacy since they cant data mine you as much thought the browser. Ditto with Facebook"
"Ultimate information. Can fin information on almost any topic repairs,health, locations. Must use a little caution because anyone can submit"
Information. I am always looking to learn and You Tube gets me directly to the area that I need and offers expert advice and information to steer me in the right direction. I use it almost on a daily basis
Quality sets to 1080p automatically. I have to constantly change the quality back to 480p because it hogs all my data up
Not saving my watch history. It hasnt save my watch history on my phone and tv and its not on pause or anything
"Best streaming app ever. Best app ever , unbelievable reliability incredible software"
To many adds. I enjoy using the app for personal and professional reasons. The adds can be annoying. I dont know about what age of person theyll be appropriate for
"What Happened. After the new update nothing refreshes. Only on my phone Ive experienced this issue. Not sure if anyone else has but please feel free to relate. Once a video is playing the ads are high quality and the video just goes right back to the lowest video quality and the description box, comments, related or interested videos are not loading. Constant Error Tap to reload. Ive reset my phone numerous times as well as uninstalled and reinstalled the YouTube app. Cleared the cache and data, signed out and back in. Still the same message. Error tap to reload. Please help"

Hi again. Hi Again Ppl can get scared.... and ppl HAVE to give out information sooooooo personal ppl can hack ya know HOPE U ALL HAVE A GREAT LIFE MAY GOD BLESS U BE SAFE:-) Im Not 10
Sad that the email notifications are no more. Love this app. One thing I dont like is not having email notifications anymore when my subscription channels post new. Now I have to manually email new videos to myself and try to remember to watch them (if I dont watch them right away)
"You tube. It is a good app but I want more information and more Videos and stuff and like especially from Lexi riva ,Brent,and Ben azalea t"
"Playback quality issues. For the last two updates when I select a specific playback resolution - the app sets its own, no matter what options I checked. The data saver mode works sometimes but if its at 360 and I change it to 144 it stays at 360. When I listen more than watch I would rather not stream high res. Also.  Its time to allow the free version of the app to still work when the screen is turned off.  Sometimes we just listen to music or poetry recitations and dont need the light emitting nonstop"
Horrible. Horrible app with so many fake bought reviews stop trying to personalise anything u know i watch All of the things this stupid app is creating are just annoying and i dont wanna see it Im already annoyed enough with your bloody ads that i will forever refuse to watch STOP HAVING A STROKE AND RECOMMEND VIDEOS FROM 6 years ago Hate this bloody app
Dont update. Recent November bugs wether you download or not is redundant as it still wont play a video regardless of quality and internet or data connection.. please have a new update soon
"Disappearing Offline Videos that take up storage space. Please fix the offline saved videos bug on IOS. I have the latest version of the up but somehow I just lost more than 250 offline videos. The space is still taken on my device but there are no offline videos in the app.I have about 25GB of misplaced data on my phone right now.Please fix this.This is the third time, this is happening to me. Previously I had over 100 videos which were also lost the same way.I have noticed the app keeps shutting down on its own sometimes too.I have little space on my phone.I didnt get a warning, to free up storage space to be able to download more videos or use the app. The app just shuts down and the next time I open it, all my downloads are gone.This is really frustrating, please fix it"
"You Tube. I dont know why I dont watch or listen to both You Tube and YT Music. The more I do the more I believe they are the greatest sources of entertainment, information of almost anything. The 3rd being Google. You Tube always amazes me. You can watch the old Smothers Brothers Show from the 1960s(I was on an episode) and the old Jack Benny Show from 1950s(I was on a few of those), or listen to some of the best music, Songwriters, Performers and even watch them perform the songs were vibrant, had meaning whether topical or romance. Those old programs I mentioned were the best - nothing can compete with them"
Good app. Very good app wish it was faster loading on mobile data though
Great app. Great videos. Great information
"A treasure trove. A world of information lies in UTube Any subject you can think of theres something on UTube that relates to it.  Sometimes I just type in a word about history or nature, or a name of a person or thing or part of the world and fascinating information appears"
"Good But,,. Overall I enjoy the platform I get to watch creators I like and its a great way to pass time.But more recently, they added the Miniplayer. The fact that I cant look for other videos while Im already watching one is just frustrating. What is the point of that? Even when it does let you look for more videos, the little box that shows the one you are already watching is off centered. I cant even see the entire picture of what Im watching. The video will just be off centered so I wont be able to see the whole thing Its just annoying.And it keeps doing this weird thing were if you click on the screen with a video selected ( like around the comments and description section ) it will enhance it??? Like, not even a full screen, itll just take up more than half your screen, and prevent you from reading the comments or description. It gets so annoying when Im scrolling through the comments just to have the video randomly enhance and prevent me from doing so.Please fix this"
My personal thoughts about the app. This is a really great app to watch something but the new update for it make it look a little weird
"bts views. thanks for stealing our views buckaroo, now ill steal ur knee caps"
"My opinion. Its the best app because u can watch any videos and ur favourite YouTubers and subscribe and win some giveaways from them but I didnt win any giveaways yet it doesnt matter about winning giveaways and YouTube I have a message for u Project Zorgo is going to delete YouTube on December 31st New Year Christmas Eve and I might not watch youtube and I hope the spy ninjas help us defeat Project Zorgo one day and wont delete youtube and the spy ninjas are my favourite youtubers if u wanna subscribe here is the four or five channels Chad Wild Clay, Vy Qwaint, Melvin the Best Fighter PZ9, Daniel Gizmo and Regina Ginera and subscribe to Project Zorgo to get private information and tell the spy ninjas bye"
Stop thinking were bots. ARMYS WORKED SO HARD TO STREAM BOTH ON MUSIC VIDEOS AND YOU GO AND TAKE VIEWS AWAY FROM US. WE ARE NOT BOTS IT IS IMPOSSIBEL THAT YOU DID NOT STEAL VIEWS FROM US SO GET OVER YOURSELVES
"DISGUSTING. i am disgusted  how dare you steal views from BTS mvs just because they aint white and dont pay for views ?? truly disappointed . i could NEVER relate being a rat like yall, idk how yall still not cancelled . "
"Bricked. After the update on 11/11/20, I cant watch videos. Even the ads dont load. It loads the suggested list but thats about it. I disconnected from my wifi to use data and everything. I even reset my phone and deleted then redownloaded the app"
"Newest update is trash. Ever since the most recent update all of my prior watch history info has been forgotten??. After I updated to this version all Im seeing is old videos Ive already watched. I have entire catalogs of videos that Ive watched that are suddenly being advertised to me again like theyre new. I dont get it.. If it can remember the kind of videos I like to watch, then how does it not remember Ive already watched them? This makes no sense. Please fix this"
"How much do you watch?. Thought less of the app after it started autoplaying videos on the home screen and stopped consistently responding to screen tilting.  Now a dialogue pops up every time I open the app or resume it from the background that invites me to track my watch stats, no matter how many times I dismiss it.  Two stars because its faster and more workable than the website on a phone, but Im not happy with all these unnecessary features"
Review. Its pretty good its just recently not really been tracking a lot of the stuff I watch and just putting some weird stuff in my recommend
"Weird changes. Why, for example, when you want to run a video at 1080p do you have to select higher picture aka uses more data. I liked the old way of simply getting what you want specifically. Even after i used the advanced picture quality the quality didnt improve. I dont need to select the quality ever time i watch a video. Shouldve kept the old version"
YouTube. Its really fun beacause I can watch my videos like spy ninjas and Liverpool  fc and 123 go
history. ive always loved the app but lately it hasnt been tracking my history and ive redownloaded the app many times The videos show up in my liked videos bar but not my history areYoutube if you are watching this plz fix thxalso i dont like the new update where the icons a super skinny i personally liked then gray icons but thats just my opinion :)
Connecting and access. The breadth of information and the ease of connecting to it is grrrrreeat
"Decent. I really love this app and I really hate how it lags when I use data then it would not let me livestream which is unfortunate but other than that its amazing app, also I kinda hate these adds"
Great Stuff. I enjoy all the space and science info  and use UTube to fix things around the house
Info. Its want u info Dont get it or u will get hacked
"The offers to upgrade are like spam all the time. About twice a day this app will say cant connect to the internet and you have to restart it.   No other app on my phone does it and my data is consistent, definitely an app issue"
"No PiP. It is pathetic that the app does not support Picture in Picture. The paid YouTube does, but why would I pay for a free OS feature that literally requires one check box on the developer side to make work? YouTube and Google make enough off the ads I each to let me have a free OS feature in their app. Im glad the new OS limits their tracking if they are being this greedy with free features"
Data/Wifi. Not a good service when in a low data/wifi receiving
Great app no doubts must Download. This is the best app where you can just  Watch people do stuff like in Minecraft I want to learn as I watch people do commands must download app
Stuff that scares me. Hey I luv watching stuf on here but theres scary stuff in recommended that I dont watch to please fix this issue I might not get nightmares but I do suffer a lot of anxiety so please can you fix this issue?
"Shambolic. Every time I launch this app, I get a pop up saying prompt expired. When I dismiss the message the entire app freezes. I then have to restart the app and then the whole process repeats. This app is unusable. I contacted YouTube but my query has bounced from department to department, so seems that nobody is interested. Prior to this, I also found that there was no settings option for the app so cant configure things like data usage, dark mode etc.Disappointing"
Most Recent Update. The most recent update has made the app not work when Im on internet.  Works on cell data and I tried all of the silly help options to get it to work again with no success.  Apparently fixing the tubes and bugs means create new ones.  Only leaving this annoying review because the app support is clearly garbage
Fair App. Youtube shuffles the deck too much. You might see several videos your interested in and watch one but when your done the other videos you were interested in are gone. It doesnt keep track of videos youve watched per channel
"The best app. Very informative, and it has very interesting information according to everyone interest"
"Search: Aka eyeball. Search: Aka eyeball ..... you tube is good, do try watching beneficial things on it though or supporting your favourite you tubers and artists etc .... dont waste your time or data on rubbish videos.Aka eyeball"
"Small, invisible controls. App often resets and loses video. the controls for working with the video under play are small, hidden and theres no way to know how to control the playback or full screen.Often the app will reset when coming back to it after switching to another app. It lose track of the video"
"Taking longer than usual to load on hd or 4K on mobile data. I have lately been a bit annoyed when trying to watch YouTube hd or 4k on my new iPhone on mobile data lagging. It did not do that originally, in fact, the speed was super fast instant. It will still play hd and 4K but there is a lag when loading and I am finding that annoying. Higher picture quality setting does not go the highest picture quality. Even 720 takes some time to load I honestly do not know what to do and if anyone has a helpful solution that would be appreciated. On top of that, I love the app"
"Horrible app. This app is actually awful. It barely uses cellular data (good for people on limited plans but AWFUL for people with unlimited data), the ads are absolutely awful, and the app doesnt perform very well. I could go on"
"Stuck in Asia, cant subscribe. My device is a US device. Im stranded in Japan and YouTube wont let me subscribe to Premium cuz their location tracking SW cant handle international travel. Guess Ill spend my money and put my eyeballs elsewhere"
I love your tube so much. The spy ninjas need to post more
Neatly amassing. I love this app but... there is a few glitches like doesnt go back to the video that you were watching and a few more but other from that I love this app and you should totally download it
"It was ok at first. At first it was fine but it bothers me that when I exited the app it would not save my data. After a while, it said I had to buy the app so I went to the App Store, and it already said I owned it. Please fix this thanks"
Awesome. This app is great download the app guys to watch the best videos
"Constantly Losing Watch History. There is no time stamps when videos were played, which is data im sure is available but they refuse to utilize it, but much more importantly there is just utter error on part of what days certain videos are played as well. Say i played a video today and last week, the history of my playing it last week is gone as soon as i play the song today, the thumbnail cant exist in two places at once for the same video? No clarity. No transparency. When you scroll and try to click a button you cant click through the scroll bar. Thats annoying and pointless"
The worst and it also hacked my account. This is the worst app Ive seen when I put my account it showed bad bad things do not download this plzIt is the worst thing
"Videos loading slowly / not at all on WiFi. Latest update has caused streaming over WiFi to be very slow to buffer or not loading at all.Doesnt seem to affect mobile data streaming.Also as another review has said, ads are loading quickly over WiFi even if the video is not"
"Power. Its a source of knowledge, personal growth, fitness, relaxation and entertainment. Thank you"
I love you too is the best. And because the reason why I love it because I get it watch cool things hacks and I get to listen to my favorite songs
Wow. I give it a 5 star because I get to watch my gacha and sssniper wolf videos if you read this I recommend you to download this app if you like watching videos of your idol
needs fixing. never works properly with mobile data
Work on cellular data. Cant watch a stupid video
"Very useful. I have a great personal benefit, my favorite preachers, worship music and so much more"
Awesome.  Its helpful and enjoy when I look for information of do it your self videos and of course watching looney tunes.
"Age verification. I wish I could give you zero. What the hell is this new ID verification or credit/debit info?? You do not need that, its none of your damn businesses. Its clear all you guys want to do is gather personal data. Fix your system"
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. this is a horrible app cant watch anything , doesnt let you subscribe , doesnt let you change ur info on your channel this app if trash"
Unbelievable. Its an incredible platform I cant deny it. Who would have thought only twenty odd years ago wed have this facility. But then who could predict the digital revolution... The downsides are heavy however. A virtual world and a narcissistic obsession with self promotion
"Best app ever . This app is incredible. Ive had fun entertaining myself through videos. Hope YouTube keeps improving . Also whoever is reading this, follow me on YouTube Channel: The G-Topia 96"
This is so fun. U can make ur own videos and watch other peoples for entertainment be careful not to watch to much though anyway have a lovely day
"5 Stars for Cobra Kai. App works well, always has. I went premium long ago to save data when I download my shows. When Cobra Kai came out its all Im waiting to watch. *mind blown*"
Very good this is a life line for people watching any kind videos. Thanks. This is life line for people who watching and getting any kinds knowledge information
Had It for about 7-5 Years and had no problems. I find a large selection of videos you can watch. I spend hours on this app daily. The only problem was caused by me not getting the software update. I do not know what to say besides that its incredible.
"Great app. Love this app, I like the opportunity your bringing to all sorts of creators from life hacks to gaming, and all around the world too I have gotten used to the new comment section and Im not mad at it anymore but great job, love it Keep up the good work "
"Comments sections. I personal like the old comments section but I can see what i should watch next before the video end while going to the comments section but now being on the top there is no reason to go down and after the video end, I would scroll down and Im have not prepare what to watch next so I mostly likely go to the home page"
Download it. You can watch many cool things but be careful because some have inappropriate content
Best app ever. As I watched YouTube I was learning information and now I know that I can become a scientist we should keep this app see you next time
"I luv this. I wouldnt change a thing, Live Concerts, Finding All types of Information about the Old Records And New info, I dont ever want to give this . Any news from covid to Healthcare. Thank you so much for being my go to when needed help and advice. No adverts i also love  when having my down time or family are here to   The Greatest"
new update sucks. wth is up with the new update?? it wont let me play any videos. it keep saying something went wrong on my screen but i dont get it. whats up??? i tried everything. its not a wifi problem since it says the exact same thing when i turn on my data. hello??
Creepy how much they track everything you do everywhere you do it. If I pay the monthly premium does that mean I will not be tracked?
Subscription. Having looked forward to it for sometime know shouldnt be much of a surprise rounded compact environments personal family or in our daily outgoing individual lives office will still play a big part

Great app. Great app. I really enjoy music and videos of information
"Delete BTS MV views. Yeah is it racist as sh*t or biased as sh*t, or maybe both? Idk but there are countless videos capturing the number of views being deleted from (usually) new, record-breaking BTS music videosplease note, bits are real, but the BTS fandom, Army, has worked hard and proven their support for BTS time and time again through BTS many numbers and records, so to suggest that bits are responsible for MILLIONS of views (usually in the tens of and hundreds of millions) is faulty.At the same time, there are other MVs being released that do not face the same type of view deletion their deletions are nowhere near BTS MVs.Now, BTS has taken the music industry by storm, breaking and surpassing legends like the Beatles and Michael Jackson in certain statistics. Their Western counterparts are quickly realizing their rise to incredible, legendary stardom, but a lot of streaming and music platforms such as award shows, and seemingly: YouTube, have not taken the new status of these talented boys graciously.So now, Army is moving forward to shed light on the situation: Lets give these South Korean musicians the recognition they deserve. STOP DELETING THEIR VIEWS AS UNFAIRLY AS YOU HAVE BEEN"
Whyyyy I was dancing >:C. So I was dancing to prom queen then it just kept loading at the same part :c. I kept reloading it And I only have 20% data. I have to waste like 10% just to get through 1 song But here is the good parts its great of songs but I always watch yt after playing Roblox because Im always bored tho so this happening for the 90th time doesnt make me happy so this makes me give u a 3 star rating OH AND WHY WHAT IF A CHILD WANTS TO FIND ANOTHER CHILDREN VIDEO WE CANT &gt;:C WE CANT EVEN SCROLL DOWN A BARBIE VIDEO AND SCROLL FOR OTHERS
Corporate Shill. Go ask your corpo overlord for reviews. You proved how much you care for feedbacks when you guys got rid of Dislikes
Your ads are insensitive. I didnt need a pad commercial or woman to show me how to do yoga Im honestly tired of this place I rather be in India with nothing this place is offensive and Ill be personal as much as I want thanks
As long as it stays free. Enjoys this app. Immensely The music is superb. The docs are incredible what more can I say. Even the ads are limited. Thank you Youtube.. Dont ever change
Mankind best friend. Easy to access music literature everyday living info this is the best
"480p Video Quality. I dont like the video quality settings in the recent update version because no matter if I choose higher picture quality or auto, it set as 480p for all videos. For each video I watches, I have to change it from 480p to 1080p manually. This is very painful. Nowadays, many users have unlimited data plan, so can we have the option to set it at 1080p? Hope this could be fixed"
"Small, difficult controls. App often resets and loses video. The controls for working with the video under play are small, hidden and theres no way to know how to control the playback or go full screen.Often the app will reset when coming back to it after switching to another app. It loses track of the video"
Wont work. Now that its been updated no videos will work. Every video I click on says something went wrong even when Im using data. I know nothings wrong with my connection cause everything is working fine. Please fix this
Personal. Mucho comercial
App stops when you leave. I dont like the fact that the app stops when you leave to look up other information
Tutorials galore. A huge library only a search away. Great place to learn about system and applications that are used in cloud transform of legacy premise based systemsI review each tutorial and decide which one is well presented and laid out well to understand the architecture and data flow etc
It uses too much data a. It always takes to much data
"Small, invisible controls. App often resets and loses video. The controls for working with the video under play are small, hidden and theres no way to know how to control the playback or go full screen.Often the app will reset when coming back to it after switching to another app. It loses track of the video"
Reviw. Videos on variety of subjects are available.Many of   them  contain useful information  and some are for entertainment. A few of both the types I use for my personal use
"Thankful for UTube. I LOVE U Tube  Ive learned so much from itThings, everyday simple things that I thought I knew, but then I look on U tube and theres always someone showing me a different way to look at things.My favorite is the perfumes and the womans personal hygiene and the different prayer channels Thankful for U Tube"
"Slow, They Bothered Me to Ask for a Review, & They Probably Sell My Data. Nuff said"
"Lots of slow videos but great app. So I use YouTube all the time and its one of the greatest apps Ive used before. However, recently videos have stopped playing and keep showing a black screen with the loading symbol. It never goes away or starts playing. It does this for most of the videos I try to watch. Ive tried changing internets or using cellular data, but nothings working. Ive cleared all cache on every app and it is still slow. If this one thing could be fixed, that would make this an amazing app that I would recommend everyone to use"
What more can I say . Im on this app more than any other. Its my go to for information
"Its just AMAZING I use this app EVERY SINGLE DAY. AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, USEFUL , HELPFUL, ANS SO DANG MUCH MORE"
Best app ever. When ever Im looking for information Utube is my go to place I love it
"Love it EXCEPT. Like pretty much all of Alphabet, I love it, EXCEPT, for all the spying, lying, demonizing, power grubbing, manipulation, BUT, other than that"
"Give us our views back. BTS has lost millions of views that were streamed by Armys not bots. Its frustrating that we spend our personal time streaming for a long time (hours for some). Wed like our views back please, thank you for your time"
"App is busted on multiple iPhones. I keep getting no connection errors while trying to load videos. Ive got 5G on, Ive tested multiple WiFis, and still nothing. The app is downloading data, I can browse the whole website, log in and out, and do anything other than load videos. The videos play in a web browser, so I know YouTube isnt down. I even dug out my old iPhone 6 and tried it there, and had the same exact issues. Its just this broken app"
YOU TUBE PREMIUM NOT WORKING. Pay 17$ a month and dont have wifi so used my own data to download music knowing I can listen to my music anytime since I downloaded them onto my YouTube account... well for over a week now my downloaded songs will not play... very disappointed since I paid a lot to download these songs on top of your 17.99$ a month charge just to be able to listen to the songs Ive downloaded. Not impressed at all
"Recommended extremely impressive. I have noticed some sudden changes with my husband&#39;s mood towards me and now life has really taught me, that don&#39;t give 99% trust to anyone no matter how they are loyal to you. I have been married for 4 years now with no idea my husband was cheating on me I notice his sudden change with the way he was over protecting his phone he doesn&#39;t allow me to touch his phone anymore I was curious. I know this will sound crazy and weird to you but trust me, I confided in a close friend of mine and he introduced me to 4silverhacker to hack and track my husband&#39;s phone and his car to know his movement and what was going on. I hire 4silverhacker @ gmail. com he is a professional and no doubt about it he hacks in my husband&#39;s cell phone device calls logs text messages and all other social platforms on his mobile phone and also tracked his car. Minding I seemed as though my husband was spinning out of control getting to find out that the man I loved so much was cheating on me with someone. I filled for a divorce I couldn&#39;t continue with lie after trusting him with all my heart. if you know you&#39;re having issues with your marriage and you need proof I will suggest 4silverhacker @ gmail. com I will tell you with a 100% guarantee"
"Bad update?. Everything except the video is loading. I open the app, everything is as normal. I go to play the video, it just continues to load and not play. My phone and data is working fine. Please fix this issue"
"For bootiful u tube,. Really, all Im disappointed in is the fact that I can look at the comments but cant MAKE comments. Its basically like eating food in front at a homeless person with no food. Oh, and the liking and the disliking, and the subscribing. Oh, and please, no private information"
the best app in the whole world indeed. i have learnt so much from the you tube that i dont have the words to admire this incredible app that has changed my life positively and i am sure lot of others as well
"Face feedback for information. Its great on videos how to fix stuff,How to find fast cars, Find Informaction on all makes of TESLAS, and how they function.Colonel James"
"Very happy. Thankyou very much, I enjoy watching videos all day sometimes, and all the information that I get"
Isnt this illegal. So I usually watch paranormal videos because I want to have nightmares but it doesnt work so then when there was a YouTuber who does paranormals I was going to see the siren head vid I was going to subscribe to jay hills but before I did that I clicked his icon to see other great videos but once I looked for other vids this guy just places gopros in hotel rooms  so I took one small peak to see if he would brake in and he did so when I thought in my head I thought if you would give him a warning So pls give him a warning because people need privacy and I could have gotten grounded so pls warn jay hills
Fantastic. It is truly incredible the best app on App Store
UTube. Loving UTube best app ever tells u everything u need to know and shows all interesting data top star rating from me
"Cant change video resolution. On the mobile app, with the most recent update, I cant change the video quality on the fly anymore depending on the content I want to watch.  It sets it auto, either you want Data Saver, Higher Pic Quality or Auto.  No more choosing 144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p etc.  I prefer to still be able to choose "

"A Staple of American POV entertainment. Incorporated into my daily streaming ,watching, pleasures. The beauty of the worlds landscapes and oceans. Learn how to do anything. Personal stories, experiences. Its amazing how lucky we are to have all of this at our finger tips"
Lots of great information. I am new to YouTube. I started using it to celebrate mass during the pandemic. I saw an orchid video and am now really hooked. Now I will try the video on mindfulness and animals. Great info
More videos. I like it But I need more videos cause I am watching all of them too fastI want more spyNinja videos And all the other videos to But I want the Spy ninja videos more
Versatile app. UTube. The best app. ever. We learn so much from the contribution of different people on their personal skills and expertises. But very annoyed when fake news exist. Great feeling to have an app. like this. Thank you so much...youre fabulous
Bricked. New update has broken my app it want load any videos and WiFi or mobile data
Adding some features. I think that if sorting by channel or related subject add to both categorisations of (watch later )&amp;?(home) would make it easier for those who watch subject related videos
"tooooooo invasive,. Asking for my ID, credit card numbers, debit card number, and other personal information Keeps dealeting my account saying Im too young when I type my age in as my current age =40. But says 17+ is able to use this app"
"my watch history. every time i watch something, it never puts it in my watch history. and i have everything up to date on my phone and the app. i even restarted my phone and reinstall the app. they need to fix this because i like going back into my watch history"
"A problem. It used to work fine, but right now, I cant even play any videos because it keeps lagging and crashing. My internet and data are fine, so can you fix the problem with this?"
Audio only tube?. Only getting audio in the videos now no matter what connection I use for WiFi or if I use data
Five stars amazing. I cannot believe my eyes I downloaded this app when I was six Ive been using it for literally two years and Im obsessed with it yeah theres ads but it doesnt bother me at all I love this app so much and please keep it this way Im a fan of the spy ninjas and I cannot believe that my friends dont have this ha ha but anyway this is the most wonderful app ever I recommend that you put this on the news
Crash bandicoot (YouTubeRed Subscriber). Crashes all the time especially when I try to allow videos to play in background and uses an immense amount of power when replaying downloads as opposed to just streaming videos with data or WiFi. I suppose it could be my phone (iPhone 7) but this is the only app that crashes. Dissatisfied at the moment. Hoping it gets better
For people who want to download this app. I love this app I can watch bootubers gachatubers and other things
Great app. Excellent source for information and know how
Appreciated. I watched three other videos on how to use a K18 GPS Spy Detector and this was the only one that actually helped
"Takes data so much. When I upload a video, it takes 500 MB in just 3 mins. What the heck is this man? Please fix this bug"
"THEY WRECKED NAVIGATION. BUT WHY???   did theDevelopers actually test this? The new navigation for the comment section is horrible, One has to do multiple clicks to see the comments. plus the commentsAre now squished on the right hand side of the screen, making it difficult to respond to a specific comment. This is a total nightmare and requires lots of effort to comment on videos. Is it this one of the goals of having a video that you can comment on??? The developer and Tustin clowns did not do their job and should be fired Perhaps they are just chasing clicks for some reason to try and scam peoples personal data?? This makes them scam bags"
Really great. So full of information and there isnt any other app that comes close
I am in love this app. This is an amazing app Please download you can watch anything you want after signing in you might even get popular I love to watch videos theres always makes me happy
Very good. I think it should blow up as it has the best content. Whatever you like it would be all in front of you. Make sure for privacy. Also the community is very nice
Download right now. First of I would like to say a thank you  for making this app you can watch all ur fav YouTubers and have fun making some yourself its amazing 10/10 for sure go download it yourself have a nice  time watching videos have a lovely day
Text translate in real time. Whoever came up with the idea to incorporate translation between different languages should get a raise. It has been one of the best updates the app has had. It is incredible to read what other viewers around the world think about a video. Opening our eyes to different views around the world and making us connect with different walks of life through out the world.(or maybe just crack a few jokes with someone i would otherwise not be able to)
"Great (& oft-addictive) Video entertainments*. *In the quarantined Age of Corona, what better pastime to add to your personal Chronicles of Wasted Time"
Sluggish performance. Seems to get my iDevices hotter than other apps - even streaming ones.   It just always feels choppy (even on an A12) - never feels smooth...On top of that - sometimes Ill play a recorded episode and it just hangs...I get the feeling this app is optimized to report your usage data to google and not for a good customer experience
"No Picture in Picture, even though its been on the iPad for more than a year. Google refuses to enable Picture in Picture mode, iPad os has had it a year longer than ios14 so they obviously are trying some bs punishment to users who dont buy google phones"
"Video Resolution UI. It used to be good giving you the full list of resolutions available for the specific video, but now you must choose from high quality, medium, and data saver or a 25 second process of selecting the resolution you want it to be. You used to be able to set the default video quality at 720p thats also gone"
Watch later capability from notification. Id like to have the ability to have a watch later choice on the lock screen notification
DONT ADD NOTIFICATIONS. i legit got 3 detentions because of the spam from the notifications. it&#39;s horrible
Opinión personal. Excelente paraMi gusto Y creo que el de una gran mayoría
This app doesnt even open and play folders. This app is  stop working  keeps coming up Notification saying microphone in privacy its not work at all disabled several times
Deletes views. Deletes views even though I have videos in my watch history
Doesnt load videos. My WiFi is good but for some reason it doesnt load a video. It even struggles to load a video at 144p but when I use YouTube in the safari it works perfect. I have to turn my WiFi off and use cellular data it loads 480p but as soon I turn my WiFi on it struggles while Im on the app. Again my internet is not a problem because it loads 720p videos perfect while Im watching in the safari
Takes views away. Yep. I would have gave this app a 0 star but- anyways. This app steals views They can take away views from your favorite artists 
Wont work. It wont work on 16 devices including Xbox ones iPhones iPads TVs and more every thing seems normal and loads properly but when you click on a video it almost immediately says something went wrong tap to try again and its not my internet Ive tried 6 different internets and multiple different mobile datas but still wont work PLEASR HELP
Totally spies. I love to watch every day on Saturday morning to eat my breakfast and watch it
Nice app. Hey devs nice app BUT can u make recommended not watch YT u watched but the vids u make
"im so upset. theres these inappropriate bots following my comments with inappropriate names and channel art and its so creepy like there tracking MY comments and copying other peoples comments and responding to my comments with that.. Not good report the bots like this for example there like: Mia (innapropriate word) channel 18+ there bots and have links that hack you and i get this every hour, minute, day, and it started 2 days ago Fix this"
"Can you give it 0 rating?. It is unbelievable - you are one of biggest companies globally but you are not able to produce glitch-free software. Every time I get on mobile data connection, your app just crashes. Why would I use any of uour premium services if your free version does not work? With every update it starts to crash more often"
Not Loading. For some reason the app does not want to load any videos. I have switched from my wifi to using data and videos still wont load. Browser search works just fine and YouTube works through the browser which means it isnt my internet
Electronics. Fantastic source of information for all electronics My hobby for over 60 years used to wait weeks for information and circuits diagrams now its instantFantastic You TubeGarry
"Early development but great leaps of faith. Its a privilege to see all the content of original moments we place together and post , Im so thankful platforms like this have come to be so wide and diverse with showing the social experience in such a early millennia experiment... the further we understand what is worthy to watch , the more our divided ways will become blurred lines ,and projects of unity may soon awaken ..., maybe the children of you tubers like Tim tracker and the generations to come will grow up on a series channel that prevails creative thinking and our personal journey , GOD bless"
"Nice app. Its just a nice app. Except some bugs and the lags, it is one of the nicest apps in stores. Well, thats my personal opinion, though"
"Never ending buffering. About half the time I attempt to watch a video it takes 10 minutes to buffer a single minute of the video. It plays for that minute, then lags and freezes for another 10 minutes, and nothing I do, even switching the playback quality, helps.And I know its the app and not my wifi because it happens everywhere I go On wifi, cellular data, at my college, my friends houses... it even works when I use the Safari or Chrome versions on my iPhone. Pretty much, the app unusable I wish theyd do something about this"
I love you tube. Yes I find you tube every educational and informative so I dont know why they gave me a strike on my personal page from one of my videos Im just disappointed today but I give you tube 5 stars regardless
"Does not default to 2160p. Even though I have my video quality setting set to higher picture quality, it never plays videos in 2160p. I have to have manually select 2160p for each video which is annoying. This is for both wifi and cellular data. Fix this asap. Makes using the app a pain"
Incredible. I have spent so long on this app I think I am going to start YouTube channel ya
000. Love in data
Add infected SPY. They have become so greedy that the adds injected into clips take longer to view than the content in some cases
Educational. You tube provides me a plethora of scientific Data I need for my medical technology presentations . Thank you
"Its a great piece of garbage. The app only works half of the time even with premium, but when it works it really runs great, other than the fact it refuses to connect to internet or cell data 3/4 if the time Id say its worth the download"
"You cant choose video resolution. There is low quality and high quality option in the settings, but the app decides which is low quality and which is high quality. I have no control over the default resolution of the videos and need to select it manually literally every time new video is played. The data on my mobile device is not unlimited. Neither the life of my battery"
Walking in the useless woods. The neighbor can watch with make make our own walk alone for 30 min walk thats my favorite show to watch.  Im talking about the blond or Burnett. I have a I phone se. only on 4.7 inches but theres a lot of love and snuggle there is cold ac on at night
Amazing app. This app is incredible my kids adore watching videos and their are even things to learn as well so while your kid is watching videos their learning as well I would recommend this app
"BUG fixes, really? Crashes every other minute. If I could rate it zero star, I would. Latest version crashes every other minute. Insane Sometimes as soon as I open it. Worst update ever. So unstable. Always bug fixes REALLY? More like we are putting bugs on your phones. Were tracking you and your habits. Well sell this info and use them against you when needed...oh and especially if youre a conservative. Yeah.  Thats what our updates are about. Were bringing CCP method here to the US"
Its pretty good. All around incredible but they need to get on the same page with the moderation team
Unfriendly interface. I find navigation through You Tube unnecessarily difficult. Its hard to get back to the previous video I watched and impossible toscroll back through a series of watched videos. It feels as though the system is trying to make me watch suggested instead of the one I was looking for
"Incredible systems.  Million thanks for the genius services.  Twenty years ago, I was wishing for watching some knowledge programs I would love to studying and doing.   Finally, I could watch all programs I wished  as YouTube makes my dream come true.  Much appreciate Warm regards"
Best app ever. So much information to use on here
Love it. I love it because I can watch Billie eilish and my favorite thing like art gaming life hacks and more
Loss all information and phone numbers. It was aweful l lost all my phone number and addresses now how do l get them back?
"Whats wrong with the app?. I tried to watch something via the app today &amp; I got a message that said I couldnt watch a shared copy &amp; needed to download a copy. Which is really confusing, because why would anyone need to share a free app? So I deleted it &amp; tried to reload it. It refuses to download now. So...whats going on? Im a premium subscriber if that makes a difference"
Info. Great information
"Amine. This is an old and great app in fact, you can upload your videos, post images And even comment something on the comments section... cant believe this app was in 2005 when susan made this incredible app"
"Latest update is annoying. Why is the latest update prompting me for local network access every single time I launch it? When I say no, I mean it. Im not giving you access to more of my data, so cut it out or else Ill just go back to using the mobile web site or just watching on my Roku. They seem to be on a mission to make it the worst service possible and its no wonder Tiktok is starting to overtake them"

"Bug Fixes? Unnecessary Comment section movement?. First of all, Im a person who prefers to have apps in the same place (doesnt love apps around on home screen) and having everything stay in the same order. So when someone decided it was a good idea to move the comments to the top, that just threw EVERYTHING off and now it bothers me. Second, I tried to open the app this morning and mind you, Ive had the app on my phone the entire time Ive had this iphone, and it said I no longer had access to it? Excuse me, this app is supposed to be free and easy to use, but now Im told that I cant even use it?"
"Nothing fix after I updated last time. Please, do not add more data in my phone, and it doesn&#39;t work at all"
Videos. I have enjoyed watching creators on here for a few years now and have never had any troubles watching them. Up until this month the video will not play if it is left paused for a while. As soon as I attempt to get back to watching the screen goes black or refuses to play the video. Even if I click out and click back on completely out of the app it keeps crashing and glitching out. I dont know what else to do to fix this issue. Which is why I am giving this app two stars instead of five
"Terrible update. YouTube had been gradually giving me used car salesman vibes. With the latest update of moving the comments section to an unreachable mystery location, Im just about done. Hey YouTube get it together money hungry fun suckers"
"U tube. Im just about to give up cable, thank you Utube. My father is 80, an its all he watches, so much information. Happy new year, thanks for helping us get through 2020, Im sure I not only talking about my family but everyones family.  Times are tuff, you made it easier to stay home an stay safe, by watching an learning. Great platform thanks for all u do, thanks for wanting my opinion. Deb Addis"

Review. All type of versatile history videos. Especially the educational history information. Very good
"Offline video play. When i am watching something in offline from saved videos while turning off the data or wifi,battery consumption is significantly increased and also heated up in my 13 pro max. But when does connected to data or wifi it becomes normal. After updating to 15.4.1 this problem still continuing. Please fix this. Please Please Please"
Incredible. The best app for video streaming and recording your very own creative content
My poinion. Some are good information but lost a lot of good ppl I subscribe to wish they would come back
Bad new update. can&#39;t preset to the resolution i want anymore.  its sucking a lot of mobile data.  and downloaded video not working
Great app. I love this app Its a great way to watch content I really recommend downloading it. I love making videos and posting them
So many problems. It wont allow me to watch anything at all it tells me there is an error. I have wifi and unlimited data. This should not be a problem Im having to deal with
"Cannot turn off in line viewing. In the iPad app, while looking at videos to view, the in line player starts on a random video and just uses up my data for videos I dont want to watch.  I have not found a way to disable it.  I have turned off Auto Play and seen references about a mute inline player but I dont see that option in the iPad YouTube app"
Awesome . This app is the best I can watch anything I want whenever I want. I give it 5 stars     because it is so easy to download and watch
"My housing dilemma?. I love to watch Incredible Tiny Homes on YouTube but sometimes I cant find it or for some reason it doesnt give me the title of Tiny Homes up there in the headlines... I am 66 years old when I lost my two pieces of property in Everson due to my lack of work, I sold my 60 acre piece of property and finally had to let go of my 10 acre piece of land d/t the man I had rented it to just in trashed it by burying cows, hay twine, old batteries, nails &amp; screws, which he buried in the forest  on the back of my 10 acres. He also broke the fence down between my neighbor and myself in two places, took out my horse trails through the woods I carefully created in making stairs that my horses went up and down through careful twists and turns. He also broke the fence down on my the front of my property not even telling me. So I fixed the gate and let my horses go in the grass filled front piece of property only to find out that a 20-30 gap was covered with tall grass leading up onto the Badger Rd. A hazard for my horses and the motorists. I was horrifiedJump ahead now &amp; Im living in a 73 travel trailer with no running water, my 3 Borzois and 3 cats outside of my horse barn dreaming of my Incredible Tiny Home Im still trying to find out how I can afford it and dont get me wrong I am so thankful for what God has done for me for providing this for me. I just really need YouTube to let my see Incredible Tiny Homes and maybe be able to dream further....Thank you so much for hearing me out. Im sorry I took so long"
Too much update. Why Every week You send an update of non less than 200 mega bytes . Are you taking some personal information or what ?????? Very strange. Very very strange 
Information. There is so much valuable info to be had on you tube. Thank you so much
"Resolution setting. Please just use highest resolution when Im using Wi-Fi. Changing it to 480 every time is extremely annoying. I miss the old feature where resolution is lower when using cellular data, and back to high resolution when on wifi"
Terrific App. Live this app. Gives me great entertainment and information and suggestions
its stuck on restricted mode but this is my personal device. in the title

"Error. I can no longer watch videos via the app. I get a fetching error when trying to sign in, I can\'t even see thumbnails or even watch videos anymore when I\'m not even signed in. My accounts just fine I can access it with the devices web browser. I can watch on my phone and desktop just fine. But not with the iPad app itself. Tried uninstalling doesn\'t work. My device must be too old. It\'ll just be nice to keep using it and not have to fork over money for an upgraded device, for something I only really use for youtube now"

"Gratitude. I just appreciate so much all the easy access information; I found everything I want to know, thanks for your hard work "

"An update that won't. Tried to watch a video, after the video starts I get an unavoidable message box that says an update is required...even tho the video is playing behind the message.  The update refuses to load and now I can only watch videos on the website.Huh...apparently you can&#39;t leave a review with zero stars"
"Not able to connect after recent update. After recent update, I&#39;m unable to use it online. It shows Youre offline. Explore downloads?. But I&#39;m able use other Apps and browser.

"I'm just spending money on instagram. I'm doing everything according to Instagram policies  But I'm not seeing growth on Instagram so I know my Instagram is having trouble reaching people.  Because my stories are reaching less than 5%, when I post on my personal Instagram and on TikTok the views reach 10%  I'm spending money on Instagram boosted my post and intend to spend a lot more, but from what I'm seeing it's not ahead if the problem isn't solved I'll have to abandon Instagram after I depend on social networks to earn money and I'm not getting the result I expect .  I hope the problem is resolved  Paulo coast  Thanks"
Great. My favorite app that I use to find entertainment and educational information.I enjoy this app
"May 2020 update. Latest update not only hides comments behind a wall where you cant read them unless you tap a text link thats about 4 pixels high, it also broke the actual function of the comments section, with glitches like the comments automatically starting you back at the top and other glitches leaving the user scrolling infinitely in a futile attempt to get to the bottom. I noticed no improvements in experience in any other areas to make up for this, either. Incredible how YT can go from a an already excellent, working system, to this mess. I really expect better in this day and age than this regression in UI from Google and TY"
Not objective at all. The data shown on the page is definitely not the actual
knowledge tool. This is an incredible tool when used to increase your knowledge
"Amazing App. Despite what all of you have said, I have used this app for years and it has never failed. The video and audio plays smoothly which I love, you can create your own YouTube channel which is also INCREDIBLE (please subscribe to my friend her channel is #Bumblebeesquad) so yes I think this is a quality app just keep making it better"
"Watch history. Our watch history isnt working since the last couple of updates. My phone, my partners, our kids.  Not the same account either. Nothing is working"
"Resolution Change. Why did you change the resolution when it was perfectly fine with 144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p60, & 1080p60 now its data saver, advanced, auto, and higher picture quality like why just please change it back"
Watch history. Why is my watch history not saving when I watch videos from my phone on WiFi??? Can you please fix this bug because it keeps replaying videos Ive already watched
"performs well bss an anoying bug with the track position slider. I have been a Youtube user for years, own my own channel and everything. However, with the latest app update, I have noticed a very anoying bug with the track position ajustment slider. The slider doesn&#39;t move backwards anymore, it just goes forward. For example, If I were watch a storm video and scanning for the best shots, I may have to go backwards if I miss a spot I like. When I go to slide backwards, the slider just keeps moving me up in the video, instead of rewinding. This is quite anoying for me because I offten watch a lot of weather and thunderstorm related ts, and will most times skip through the video to the best content. Sometimes, I will land in the middle of a lightning strike, and don&#39;t get to see it. So what do I atempt to do? I try to rewind. However, again, it doesn&#39;t do anything but fast forward by like 10 seconds. Can you please fix this Google? Other than this issue, performance is great. I have not had any issues with the app crashing, or videos buffering like crazy. Also, the bug I mentioned a while back regarding privacy of uploads I make has been fixed. Thank you to Google for keeping this app nice for most everyone"
Feedback. I mostly saw the Pakistani dramas and personal vlogs so easily through YouTube. So this is how you-tube make sure regarding my entertainment
Fix it. When I watch a video it doesnt show any recommendations/related videos under it anymore :/
"Marginal performance. I have he this service for quite a while. It is true that it is less expensive than most cable networks, there does seem to be a Get what you pay for value here. It seems strange to me that when the live service goes wrong it is usually with Fox News??? When I contact support they are Collecting data. This service is getting pricie enough that if it continues to be unstable, might be time to search for another service"
"stupid app. stupid app always starts at 720p, no matter how many million times you set the stupid videos to download at 144p because you are on mobile data.Che porcherie che fa questo Gugg della mazza....non funziona un menga"
Chad wild clay. I like these YouTubers there are chad wild clay   Is so funny and I want Melvin pz9 want to ba a spy ninja
Resolution. Why mess with the resolution options? I dont need tour help saving data and videos look awful now. Honestly i dont know whats happening with this app anymore
Sad. App no longer a works on cell data - apparently needs WiFi network access... to bad
"Was good. I use this app with very limited data, since the newest update the app doesnt open just crashes on startup"
Quality settings are broken now. You guys messed up the quality settings for videos It\'s obvious the the higher number for quality means more data like bruh revert it
"Dead app. Have been waiting for a video to load for 10 minutes with a 2020 load hone and unlimited data.Dead app. Wont log me in, wont load. Deleted"
My favourite. Its to good I love watching rebeca Zamolo its so fun I spend hours watching YouTube and I watch the spy ninjas
"Normally great. Whats up with the app? It updated and now when I go to search anything it just continually loads. Ive tried multiple networks my cellular data, restarted app and restarted whole phone but to no avail. Sooo whats up with this latest update?"
Getting information. Love this app - I am naturally a curious person and I find this app complete with the information I want to know.  Everything at my fingertips
Love it. I get so much info from watching YouTube
"Great app But . Love it but i have 2 requests. #1 the option to leave out or dislike kids bop music. #2 get it together and make an apple watch app, so i can listen to music through my watch when my phone isnt around. 5 stars besides that its a 5 star app"
Could live each & every day watching UTube...has so much information on it. Only watch the relevant ones or you need to live away from this very addictive info sessions
(Information). Amazing channels love app
Problems. Everything has been fine so far apart from the fact that I cant go into the app with out a notification telling that I have to download from the App Store when I already have downloaded it
addictive. Pretty incredible
"Cant play any videos. Every time try and play a video it says something went wrong and I cant get anything to work. I have a great signal on WiFi and cellular data, but nothing helps"
Felicitaciones eres excelente persona. Linda personal brilla con luz propia Nos enseña mucho cosas positivas Sigue así te queremos mucho
Buffing constantly loading. Please can you fix this issue it has been a massive plague on the app and on consoles  and its really getting annoying when your trying to watch videos at 1080p and then gets switched too 144p thats not acceptable on the platform in my eyes its like I have to go on data on my phone when Im home when I have WiFi
It kicked me off of my account with all my subscribers and Im now upset. It kicked me off and I had worked so hard getting a personal editor and buying the stuff and now its all gone
Wishing the FaceBook Channel would return. I know this is not up to the app developer but I just wanted to put it out there that Id like to watch FaceBook w/o mirroring and wasting my iPhone data. I hope others out there are interested. Im sure its some kind of battle between the networks. I sure wish it would stop. Id really like to stream whatever I enjoy. Maybe someday
"Educational Site. Amazing information for various hobbies I have, even info for my current new business adventure"
This new update is the worst. My watch history isnt working. What are you guys doing? Fix it. Now
Bad. This company disgusts me on a personal level
"Good source of information. I love it and is a good setup, the info is great "
No to removing dislike count. This will actually help spread of misleading information and will not make anything better
"profile pictures. i can&#39;t change my profile picture on my phone, it glitches and i can&#39;t press any buttons so i have to exit the app. i have an iphone 11 for extra info and i used to have an iphone 7 a few days ago, and i had the exact same problem. please fix this i don&#39;t want to get out my laptop just to change my profile picture"
"Excellent Prayer. I love every minute spent with the Lord, in my quiet moments. Praying on Youtube feels real. I meant hearing the voice of those praying felt like being in the house of God, in this case, Im in the privacy of my little apartment. And I feel the presence of Holy Spirit here. Im thankful that Jesus has anointed people to work on YouTube so that they will deliver prayer through this site to the whole world . May The Lord continue to perfect His will in us. Thanks for giving me this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude in this medium.Maria"
"The Comments are dreadful, info on shares. When it says this app is no longer shared with you that means it has dropped support for family sharing, if your family members have downloaded this before you, that means you have a version of their app. That means you have technically never added it to your library, you have just downloaded from your familys. There is no need to rate 1 star due to this being a problem with your ios device and reinstalling will fix on the spot. Androids are not affected Sure comment section is bad, but not unusable so deal with it. This message is by ExperoPlayzYTSpread this message"
PIP PLEASE. YouTube is such an incredible platform. Thank you all for facilitating it. But Picture In Picture would be much appreciatedmake it feel like its at home in the OS
"Learning about things I always wanted to know. I am a 74 year old male with a formal education, experience in culinary arts and general business operations. I have enjoyed learning about nature, cooking, trains, marine life and of course musical talents like Bruno Mars, IL Volo, National Geographic, animals in the wild etc. etc. Yes, Utube can be a remarkable tool. What I do NOT appreciate is how the architects of this wonderful app follow everything I do so they can sell businesses my personal information. Somehow there needs to be easier options to prevent that if one chooses. Thank for reading this"
"Utube. I enjoy watching u-tube, and the variety of shows and free info about how to do things"
"Information appreciated . Learning is very rewarding especially when there is a tool that is available to respond at a touch. I am amazed , World  history has   information that links All of our stories . EDUCATION  on this planet, our solar system &amp; beyond the stars . Thanks for the tube.These words describe exactly how I appreciate &amp; Amazed of this... Thank you"
"Do not download this app. Traitor, this app is selling US to communist. I will never forgive you for what you have done in 2020 election. I am actively looking for replacement. Soon this app will be erased from my cell phone forever"
Free movie wont stream on Premium (cell data). Free movie wont stream on Premium (cell data)
Absolutely Horrible. They really think they can steal views from army. Lmaooo bots dont make dozens of dozens stadiums sell out
No Support for Picture in Picture. I am deleting this app from my IOS devices until the support Picture in Picture like all good video apps on IOS.  I will be using the web version in a privacy browser with nothing else running until they update the app

"Love this app. I downloaded this app in 2001 and the way it has changed is incredible Definitely SHOULD download. You can learn, create, film and watch tons of videos just with this app and it uses not much battery at all"
Fantastic. THIS APP IS INCREDIBLE
Erick07. Well definitely need in my app when I go whit another app keep play dont stop playing and maybe needs more highly audio in some tracks..Just keep playing using different app
Iphone 12 ProMax AT&T 5G full bars cant stream at 480p. This app has gotten so bad Cant stream hardly but at 360p But Netflix Amazon Hulu All stream fine so it isnt the phone or the 5G data Its a poorly written app plagued with bugs and adsStill same issue full bars in city 5G and barely can stream 480p on this appThis app is complete trash Tested speed over and over daily for weeks always 48MBPS or higher and that is way more than enough for 480p and 720p to stream and this is with NOTHING ELSE RUNNING ON the phone
"Fraudulent. Been a customer for years, but I just started getting ads on YT Premium, and their rude agents refused to either rectify the issue or give me a refund. This is a scam. Next step is a BBB complaint.Update: the reps have told me it doesnt work on Amazon devices, yet refuse to tell me where I can find this info for myself"
"APP OF THE YEAR. This is the best app ever you can download videos too watch them anywhere, and watch millions of videos. Its amazing and unstoppable"
"Idle app crashes. If app is idle (not playing any video) in the background or if you lock your screen, it crashes and reloads the entire app from startup. This is driving me crazy. I cant pause a video and then come back to it and resume it, nor can I keep track of whats on my home page in between uses without it resetting. I hate that. I like to continue my session on the app by continuing to scroll down the home page. Its been happening for a whole week and Im losing my mind"
"Everything. I can learn how to sew, do yoga with a private instructor every morning, learn how to start my weed wacker and learn about the drama in the royal family all in the same place. Sold"
"Problems accessing. Why when I now try to log into You Tube it says that I no longer have access and that I have to purchase the app through the App Store, yet when I go to the App Store it just says Open?????"
recenzie obligatorie. pentru a inbunatati experinenta vizuala pe youtube folositi va rog sau adaugati o varianta full screen pentru ecranele nai mari automat sa fie ca utilizatorul sau nu fir nevoit sa juasteze de fiecare data cand intra in aplicatie 
Eh. Im not liking the video quality changes Bring back the numbers take away the dumd advance stuff I want my numbers backAlso when I switch the data saver that was on 360p from 144p it doesnt switch back to the original data saver 360p can it change that bug
VIP Financial Education. Im learning  a lot about how your money work for you and not you working for your money  . And how to pay 30 yrs mortgage to 5 to 7 years only using  debt weapons. I need more info to execute the learned information
Why?. My watch history isnt showing up it says it has no videos and I didnt pause or delete my history
Features missing. I noticed that the iPad version dont show stories of the channels we subscribe like the app on the phone does. Also the app dont provide Picture in Picture capabilities which I think at this point is a must to support multitasking features on your device. If they fix these things I think the app would get 5 stars
"No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture. Also, ability to add to watch later list with one click like on the desktop website"
Stop. Stop asking me to rate this app. You have my money so obviously Im content. If you continue to ask I will give a low score every time. Good luck with the data analytics
"Doesnt show correct data. As an ARMY, I would like to say that data shown on BTSs newest video is not accurate. The views are off by 67 million. It would be nice if the views werent removed for no reason. Maybe Bighit should start using other platforms that actually work"
Great Information. Good information for my Certification in Personal Training
Hey. Theres a lot of good and bad information on here but they are both equally interesting and important
Scam adds. You should be ashamed of yourselves for how many scam adds with fake information you let slide by. I just got one that said the pancreas had nothing to do with diabetes. Not only is this information misleading but is so dangerous and could kill people if they follow what this has to say . You guys are just greedy money hungry terrible people if you let adds like this be used on your platform. Absolutely disgusting

The update just crashes. It says I dont have the app and have to download it from the App Store. But when I got to the App Store it just says open but it doesnt work. I dont want to delete and lose all my data
Too many lapses or lags in conversations. Awful to watch with the lags in conversations that obviously words are missing: just hard to tolerate to watch
Lake Kid AR. Watch U Tube every dayGreat information
"Three complaints. One solution. Single guy. Unreliable red bar: When a video is watched there should be an indicator besides the unreliable red bar on the bottom. There should perhaps be a small dot somewhere on the thumbnail or title indicating at least 3 quarters of the vid has been watched. Past few month while in the middle of watching a video on my pad or phone i will rewind and instead of 10-15seconds it jumps back 30m to an hour Not fun. When scrolling YT on the phone videos will start playing (without audio) no problem, but these passing clips save into the watch history I haven&#39;t watched these videos, they play while i slowly scroll through the main screen. Or if i put my phone down it will say I&#39;ve watched whole videos, never watched them and dont like the videos piling in my history and than recommending similar vids"
Unreliable. Sporadic tracking of members so not always able to access what I pay for
Not working from mobile data. Why is it not working since yesterday when Im using my mobile data? Fine from Wi-Fi. Ive deleted and downloaded it again but nothing has changed
"crash and comments. it wont let me load anything like the app is crashed, and its not my WiFi or data. tried both. and the comments being at the top? no, I like scrolling down and watching a video. just go back"
Latest app wont set low resolution. My only access to internet is via mobile data. The new app wont let me set 144p as default resolution. Developers need to consider not everyone has access to the latest and fastest networks. Please return control
Absolutely incredible app. Hi I am writing to you and all the people off you tube.I am astonished how extremely excellent this app is .When I come home I watch you tube no broblems at all.As off the graphics I am shocked how awesome it is.When you get this please respond all regard fan
"subscriptions. I was looking through the list of the channels im subscribed to and there was over 10 channels ive never heard about and definitely would have never subscribed to based on their content that I was apparently subscribed to. Most of the channels are smaller, with under a 10k subscribers that have nothing to do wit my personal tastes... Im overall just really confused"
Great app. I love this app it has a lot of information
App consistently glitches. The app has been glitching for about a week now. My data connection has nothing to do with it because everything else works. App opens but videos are not playing. If the problem gets fixed Ill change my rating
"Cant open app. I think there is a bug with the new iOS update effecting some apps not all, checked online and an article said to go to settings&gt;general&gt;storage&gt;click on app affected&gt;offload&gt;then redownload. Worked for me and it kept all my data"
Spy ninjas. I dont think I have any more money
Hi spy Ninjas chad videos are not there. Stay safe
It a great app. I enjoy watching videos and watching building hacks its just a great app
"It says I cant have this anymore. On my personal account, on my personal phone it will not open. It says I have to purchase it from the App Store. I thought oh maybe it logged me out. Went to the App Store and hit open. It takes me back to my regular phone screen where a message says I have to purchase the app. I pay for the premium. I may just have to cancel this"
"Incredible information source. Whether it be a self help video on replacing a clutch in a Harley Davidson or seeking information or entertainment, YouTube is a rich resource"
App has been ruined. History is no longer available unless you sign in so you tube can track you. I refuse
??. So when i wanted to watch a channel it would say its not available but Im still getting the videos and notifications..thats something I dont understand
Variedad y calidad. Me gustan los videos de  crecimiento personal y de cocina
Watching any of the American show. Every time I watch family Guy or American dad or any type of shows related to cartoons towards our old series the screen keeps m mini screen
Deleted views. İ wish if there was other app to watch the videos in
No Apple Watch app and no picture-in-picture. Needs Apple Watch app so I can listen to podcasts while exercising without the need of my phone and picture-in-picture
"It gave up. I really loved this app, but recently the videos took forever to load. Then today they just loaded and thats it. I turned off the data, restarted the phone, cleared some space, checked the WiFi and it wont work. In fact, after updating the app, the videos just gave up and said theres an error. Its been like this the whole day. I dont know what to do. I have a feeling this app just gave up"
Spanish version on the book of Isaiah. I dont like dramatized version. Its just my personal choice
Why is it so hard to talk to yall. Already paying for premium but practically getting no service. Where has the Picture in Picture feature gone to? Why is there little to no info on this???
Please. Hey for some reason a lot of people watch history so YouTube please fix it
I love this . I cant stop watching this app and spy ninjas and rev a Zamora and stuff and if I could rate this hire I would give it a  its the best you should get it to  love
Security breach compromised. Was sent an app that compromised mi personal information when according to iOS interface its unable to be accessed by third parties my calls being redirected to other parties asking for sensitive information and being blackmailed by anonymous callers I hope this problem gets resolved as soon as possible
View system is trash. The new way of tracking views is complete bullsh*t
"Notifications tab disappeared. Since about a week, my bottom tab to see my replies from comments was replaced by the  +  to access my camera library in my iPhone. My videos and pictures are not my interest to share them in YouTube. But my replies in notifications were.Now they say, they cannot fix the problem they created with some updating. Maybe I should cancel my subscription"
"Amongus. Very great app for watching all sorts of things, also a great way to watch government related videos. Very funny app with the permission to make hilarious memes. Good app"
Incredible. Literally the best and only app I use on my phoneIts that great
We know why you are removing dislike views. You have a long track record of suppressing certain views whether they a true or not. This is just another move by the racist progressives to silence any opinion they dont agree with. Great job
"Defaults to 480p as higher picture quality. Unable to choose a specific resolution as my preferred resolution, am limited to higher picture quality or data saver. Higher picture quality is literally 480p. Absolutely useless on a retina iPad. I have to manually set every single video to 1080p even though I have over a 100mbps connection. Absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary, just let me choose"
Woke App - Go to Rumble. The usual crap that comes from these woke brainwashed poppets. This app tracks and sells your data. Go to Rumble
Yoga. I love that I have the ability to search and find these amazing people who are blessed to heal in a way or educate on what theyve learned and are passionate about.  Im grateful got this app as its helped me on my personal journey to be the best version of myself

Access to information. Love this application from music to historical facts to documentaries home repair all of the above very satisfied
YouTube is the best. This is so good to watch aspeashly fights
Worst app ever. This stupid app refuses to work on a continual basis. Ive downloaded it to the tv multiple times and the ONLY TIME it works is when it is newly installed. It doesnt respond to Apple TV remote all the time. It will work for a few days and then stop. Then I have to delete and download again so it works again. Garbage app
Not getting notifications. I was getting notifications whenever a video was loaded up but now Im not getting any notifications on my phone from YouTube I get email but when I have the app open it tells me but I used to have badges come down to let me know when a new video is uploaded from a channel that I was subscribed to
Jimmy. Its a lot information can I have to access.And the way to learn.Im really enjoy to add more knowledge.Thank you so much for this website
Account issues. When I try log in to my account it says I dont have access to this service but its my account so I should be able to use it.. and it says to contact my organisation manager but I dont have one ... Im just a kid I just want to subscribe to ppl T-T
"Old version was great. I miss the old app. It allowed me to watch my downloads even when the internet was poor. Now even when watching my downloads, the little circle spins, and ......... waiting, waiting, isnt that why I downloaded it? Oh, if I turn off my cellular data it works fine, but wait, then nothing else will work??????????Update:Seems that the download problem is better.My main complaint now is that it still plays songs I have liked and then unliked. Pretty annoying that you cant change your mind, and once a song is on your liked list, it is a lifelong commitment "
The new age restriction rules are invasive and out of hand. I absolutely refuse to give my aid or credit card to a company twisting my arm for said information
"To many adds, especially on a backing track that Im recording on, ridiculous. Adds need to stop especially on backing tracks, or in the middle of a song Ridiculous Rubbish We get it  Need to buy more"
Thank you. You have made access to information easier  Thank you from my family  We are you tubersAmazing
"Update is bad. Now when I watch a video, during the video I cant see other videos related when I swipe up. I hate that"
"I havent been able to use the app without a wifi connection. Couple days of days ago my app just decided to stop working every time I log in and Im not connected to the wifi it just says you are offline , Ive restarted my phone 4 times already and turned on and off my data and even deleted the app 3 times and still doesn&#39;t work unless Im connected to wifi and its not my data because Im writing this without wifi and I can use every other social media , safari , Netflix etc without wifi so it is the app ... you should fix this app its very common to have different problems with this platform "

"You Tube Your Gateway to a Place Beyond Time and Space. Whatever esoteric disciplines excite you are available from You Tube. What will life be like on the Martian Colonies ? Is time travel possible ? Are we humans alone in the Universe ? What would Aliens think of us and will they necessarily recognise us as Intelligent or would they see us as vermin ? You Tube is an infinite source of fun, romance and hard data on do it yourself. Unputdownable fun on steroids"
Copywright. A lot of people are saying songs are unreleased but really theyre featured songs.. isnt that stealing?
Amazing. This is amazing to listen to songs and vidoes but yiu need data
Copy & paste. I cant copy data from the description field or from the comments sections so that I can paste them to my research documents
"Nice on the phone, not very good on Apple Watch. On the phone its a pretty bog standard app like all the others. On the watch theres a delay before the app update the status, which may take a few seconds. Extremely irritating. 4 stars for the phone app, 2 for the watch app"
Amazing. This app is amazing you can download it for free and you can watch anything u can think of but there are a bunch of adds but you can buy the premium in the app you can even watch shows that you have to buy it has endless possibilities I give it 5 stars.
Resolution low option gone. I have limited data and i have to set resolution to minimum every time  . Data saver option dont work it sets to 360 or 240 automatically depending on network conditions. Please revert to old settings where i ser it once to 144 and it never changed

Get rid of Section 230. Stop the steal
complaints. why was the notification tab in the app removed i use that often to find what im looking for when im subscribed to a channel along with other notifications in it
Hey. When I go to open the app it said I dont have access to it and says I need to but it but I have it downloaded and everything idk what the deal is but it needs to be fixed.. and the 17 age rating is awful
Excellent. Excellent app.. has everything and more.Serves as my personal tutor and  comfort . 
Thank you. I am grateful this platform exists. I have accessed information that I could not have otherwise. I appreciate the foreign language ads too
"Payment Method. UTube Video payment method on Apple smartphone needs tweaking to allow personal credit card changes so that payments can be made on time. Due to this technical limitation, I am unable to make a payment at the present time. An address or telephone number to make a payment would suffice if this option can not be resolved. I am very satisfied with the range of topics from a broad spectrum of authors and speakers from somewhat earlier and more contemporary historical culture. The quality of service is excellent in so far as being able to access and share the videos with individuals who may also enjoy viewing them"
The New Upgrade Is Terrible. This new version is AWFUL I cant access my search history or watch any video related to whatever Im watching. Please fix it. It was fine literally a minute ago and than THIS happened. It crashed my videos. Please just fix this This new version is absolutely horrible
"No PiP. its honestly very annoying only being able to watch a video on the app and not having the picture in picture option, especially when watching a podcast, video essay, audiobook etc. i would totally give them five stars but not having the PiP feature is just a really dumb move lol"
Glitch but fixed. Thanks for fixing the glitch where it says error saving video data
Steve Hockings. Great to have access to such high quality content at the push of a few buttons. So many great things to watch

Why. Why the watch later list when putting the phone into landscape mode? It isnt needed here
"Incredible. Im sure everything that should be said has already been said, so Ill just say that the simple layout of the app is quite comfortable. Im not sure theres anyone Im even saying this to, but if you havent already, give this app a download"
Absolutely incredible app. I have watched yt from when I was 4 no broblimos at all please reply after you have got this you tube bye bye now xx
Never works. Stop throttling data
"Apple Watch Functionality. It would be really nice if the app interfaced with the Apple Watch. When Im watching a video but then need to step out the room, I have to walk back to my phone to pause the video. Also, the app does not interface into my iPhone control panel which is frustrating"
Yt FeedBack Note. I Love It It sends me notifications fast and it helps me when I need a laugh

"Robert Stern. Utube brilliant I use it mainly to research information including sailing and ebiking. For example Ive recently bought another Ebike utube given me international access to top quality video demonstrations, product, technical information. I have been watching Citrus Bikes videos from Canadian and Propel in American videos which are not available in uk. This gives me confidence in knowing Ive throughly researched my purchase. Its extremely good and easy to use. Highly recommended"
?. It isnt allowing me to open the app. Its saying its no longer being shared and I must BUY it from the store. It is saying it is downloaded but wont let me access it
"Chromecast has stopped working. I can no longer reliably connect to Chromecast through the YouTube app.  When I click the Chromecast icon, no device can be found. I dont have this problem with any other apps and can see from Googling the problem and reading various message boards that many many other people have been having the same problem for over a year.It seems to work sometimes if I turn mobile data on and off. Its haphazard though, and frankly, annoying to do"
Info jungle. You have to marvel at the depth of information on just about anything your interested in learning. You tube an interesting know it all friend
"Great info. When Im interested in a special subject, I always check You Tube first. Great information and Ive learned so many things here Thanks EveryoneJanice Helton"
"Comment and Search Features for iPad. The new format of browsing comment feature on iPad is just horrible and unnecessary, it used to be directly scrolled down to view for more, but right now we have click view more and then more comments appear on right side. This is such an unnecessary UI designAlso, I am wondering when YouTube is going to fix the search bar disappearing bug on iPad when using a magic keyboard. It has gone through so many versions but the bug is still there, incredible"
Me informo de una forma más personal... gracias. Es una ventana al mundo de lo que quieras o no ver Libertad
Amazing. This app is so incredible
Good app. I love watching vids on this app.I prefer you download it
Horrible. I now cannot access my app. I have to go to Safari to watch my videos. It tells me I have to buy the app. WTH?
Spy ninjas. i Washington whatching Spy ninjas on this app
iTunes. Love the wide variety you have access to download and make your own personal favourite playlist to enjoy. Having some favourites and some of the best are used by professionals to showcase their dancing skills
Jasmine M. It keeps track on what ur listening to too I love it
Hey. When I go to open the app it said I dont have access to it and says I need to but it but I have it downloaded and everything idk what the deal is but it needs to be fixed
"Bug. Both on the iphone and ipad app, the app isnt tracking that I fully watched a video or where I left off a video"
Incredible app. Amazing features
Feedback. You   Have to fix notifications they are still broken
"Shuffle broken. The app itself is good. But when Im on the road and dont want to waste my data, I turn off my data to the download section to listen to my playlist...... except it wont let me shuffle my downloaded playlist while offline. Hope the developers can fix this"
"Latest update messed it up. I play some other video but there is another one running in background. I cant figure out which one until i go back and see the entire list. Also, please do not auto start videos playing on the list , it eats up data pretty quickly"
Minimising Screen ???. I think its pretty silly that the app doesnt do any of the features of a desktop version.. whats the point of the app then?? I have to go to desk top mode on my phone in order to minimise my screen so I can carry on with my other tasks at the same time.. This feature should be a priority for a phone app

"A dream. I love it. Ive been using this app more than I use my other apps its an amazing thing to do when your dad or bored. Like who doesnt wanna watch YT, am I right? But thank you for developing this incredible app. Keep it up"
Popup to subscribe comes up far too often. UX seems to not be a priority anymore
Project zorgo is watching. Always remember project zorgo is watching help us defeat the spy ninjas and end YouTube
"Bugs. Issue doesnt let me watch any videos, it leaves me on a loading screen. Lovely, isnt it? "
Bug. It will not let me play any video and says something went wrong. I tried on WiFi and cellular data. Nothing
Great video to hear first hand info. There is always something worth watching
My watch history is not updating. I love the app I watched a new video from my a channel Im subscribed to and when I was done watching it the red line didnt pop up on the video and the video was not in my watch history. I did like the video and it was in my liked videos playlist. I really hope that this problem will get fixed soon
Read first what update about before downloading. This update a joke or hack perhaps?  It appears to be
i get it. A 40 minute tutorial and the first 20 minutes explaining personal situation. frustrating
"Confusing and not the same vibes. The new format of the app isnt my personal favorite, if it could be possible Im sure many would prefer it to be reverted back to the original but maybe people will eventually get used to it in the future...? Not too sure how I feel about it to be honest, I dont like it, but Im not all against it...change is good but when it comes so suddenly and in such a big way, its hard to adapt"
Love you too. Love watching the spy ninjas
"Needs fixing. When I watch a video, related videos arent showing. Fix now"
Spy ninjas. The best
"Come on google. No Picture in Picture (even if you are a premium subscriber) no optimization for track pads for iPad, and it just looks like one of those blown up phone apps on. FIX THIS"
Thank you YouTube. Cool for watching the spy ninjas

"Virus/ problem with it. Im starting to hate it. One minute, you watch a video then the next its pausing every minute. Its like Im running off of my data when yet Im using WiFi but still.... it shouldnt freeze like its doin"
Shorts feature is short on. Shorts needs a preview mode. Who wants to waste time and data on a random video you may have no interest in or just plain stupid?
"I CAN FIND ANYTHING. You Tube is incredible I can find anything I mean I saw a split second clip on TV of Joe Jonas belting out a line from what I found to be a catchy tune. Never heard the song in my life before. Went to You Tube, entered Jonas Bros into the search bar &amp; bingo, I was immediately taken to Jonas Brother &amp; a multitude of their songs &amp; get this, the very video that was the d song I was looking for. Incredible. Maybe I say that because Imma 65yr old Boomer. The point is You Tube allowed me to find the song including the words to the song &amp; the video in less time than it would take to research it online. The bonus was I got to watch a video of a Group I would never have considered before looking up to see if I could find the song I heard. The results of my search led me to know Im gonna use You Tube to search out more bands &amp; music"
Cant watch it. After the update it wont let me even watch anything because every time I click on the app it says that its no longer sharing with me so I have to download it again
Your new update. It doesnt work. The refresh page works but the search bar does not. On internet NBN its not loading on mobile data its not working. Inconvenient when I needed music streaming for my workout/class. Now I have to use another app to stream music for my clients
Videos not working. Hey this is A problem I cant watch any videos on your app and this is a big bug and this is not good
I cant download it. For some reason you need my billing info and I put it in and it wont download

"Remarkable platform. I love this app for it introduces you to incredible music, artist and so much more. Its one of the first platforms that Ive come to know and love. Thanks to all the wonderful workers behind the scenes who makes this accessible to people who cant afford to learn from public or online schools:) Thanks again"
"Glitching. My app is glitching a bit. I cant watch anything on here. It just says error loading with everything and I have full bars of wifi and unlimited cellular data so its a problem with the app. Please fix this Otherwise, its a great app"
Fix it. Loading time is awful I thought it was my internet at first but it isnt I try to use my data instead of WiFi and its the same all my other apps load just fine idk I might delete soon
Awesome. Great for information and guidance if used correctly well done to all the smiling educators 
Hi. This app is incredible I love it
You got to listen. All you want to hear at the touch of a button and great feedback and inside information on the tracks you listen to
Help. So Im on my iPhone7pro and I was trying to watch yt and my phone didnt show the video
Update now requires local device access to cast. I dont understand why this is allowed. Thinly veiled privacy invasion for convenience. The app should not be allowed local network access to simply cast to another device
"One point I dont like is:. On the iOS app for iPhone, when you read comments sometimes you want to put it back to full screen. You used to be able to just tilt the phone sideways for it to go back to full screen but now it keeps the comments on. So you have to press the cross to get the comments to go away again. Why was this change made to the app? The point of putting it in landscape is to get the full picture so obviously you want the comments gone. Its an annoying change that was made for no good reason. Things like that real piss me off"
Buggy. The watch history isnt show videos id watched
"Hardly works. Watching a video is impossible because the video pauses constantly and then shows the loading animation forever, even though its already buffered. The only solution Ive found is to download the video through the app and turn off cell data and wifi to watch it"
Whats going on. My notifications are not getting through at times and sometimes the channels I want to watch are unavailable at this time.  Why?
Help please. Hey I dont know but please read this there was achannel  called chicken nugget reuplaod but it is now hacked by bonnie is hacking they are saying racist things and basically being toxic please fix this I love ur app btw you guys are doing great but please do something about this
Terrible. App shows I have zero downloads however iPhone storage shows app is taking up 40gb. When I try to go to a video I had downloaded before I can play it even in airplane mode so basically my downloads are taking up space in my phone but I cant access them
My watch history is not updating. I love the app I watched a new video from my a channel Im subscribed to and when I was done watching it the red line didnt pop up on the video and the video was not in my watch history. I did like the video and it was in my liked videos playlist. I really hope that this problem will get fixed soon.Update my channel switch accounts is not loading it says an error occurred. April 12th 2022
Eh. Its real slow even at full bars and data might be cause of lots of user idk
"Notification update not helpful. They just updated notifications so that episodes are bundled, but now I cant remove an episode at a time to track what I havent watched. Interesting update, but didnt think through the full user experience. Please update. Thanks"
IDK. I love this app I can watch stuff like how to bake a cake. Its all I need Download it it is a good app
Oof. Its a fantastic app Its so Hoff for personal music
Why cant I open anymore???. For some reason I cant open the app from my phone anymore Its telling me I ca no longer access the app because I need to purchase it. When I go into the App Store to download it automatically closes
"Resolution. this is the app that consumes 80% of my phone battery. absolutely love it, however, this recent update, they&#39;ve added the &#39;data saver, high picture quality&#39; options. which I think is completely unnecessary. now its difficult to switch resolution without clicking extra unwanted options. I like the older one where it allows you to choose your desired resolution in a single tap"
++. Excellent app very useful from educational to personal interest
"This great but the ~glitches~. OMG, it wont let me see the comments lol, if someone says something i get a notification but then when I go to see its gone.?? Like ughBut hey other than that cool"
Doesnt play Downloads offline anymore. This now sucks because it doesnt play my downloads when offline anymore. It worked great this past year until about a week ago. I pay for premium so I feel like Im being ripped off now since I pay for premium for the purpose to watch my downloaded songs when not on wifi or data. :(Tried to contact support many times with no luck
"Awesome. It has all the information that I need, especially older, historical info. Also it has all genres of topics and is very easy to use and access"
Just enough. Always just enough data to make you thirst for more
"Total no no. When I downloaded this app, I was just trying to watch the video. Then I decided to delete this app and the same thing popped up"
P. Can u pls give data back
From Alese. Incredible app that I spend my whole life on LOL
incredible. i seriously love this app. great for everything honestly
"Suggestions/comments/about section. Ever since the last update this section has said unable to load for me. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled, reset my network settings, tried WiFi/data, restarted my phone and come to the conclusion its the app not my phone please fix this asap"
Great app. I love this app it has a lot of information on Gods letter to us
Buggy. The watch history isnt showing videos id watched
Garbage. Dumb app cant even play 1080p 60FPS on my IPhone 11 Pro Max Be it on WiFi or mobile data
Very slow. Ive been have problem with the app being really slow when using cellular data.Cellular data is working fine on all other apps. It works fine on Wifi
Great time watching. Standing in line isnt so awful anymore. P&N
"Notifications. A good app overall, but I noticed that notifications have no sound at all from this app. This is annoying when I want to catch a live stream, because I pretty much have to be already looking at my phone to see the notification"
Amazing app. Whoever created you to thank you from the bottom of my heart it is incredible
"My personal favorite invention of the century. As someone born in 1983, I remember having to bike to Blockbuster or sending a money order to some PO Box to get  content I wanted.  The fact that I can put what I want in a search box and get results is incredible"
Cant open it. Every time I try and go in the app it says I need to buy it in the App Store when it is already downloaded. And I have premium so I cant even use that. And I am paying for that. This app is basically stealing money from me
disappointing. Its not only disappointing but disgusting that this company has taken the role of tyrant in eliminating content that disagrees with its leaderships political views not even that of the entire company. I expect true democratic corporations stay objective and reserve their personal views to themselves instead of acting like dictators. Shame

Plz help. I deleted the app but when I tried to download it back and it kept asking for my credit card info
No. I liked this video was about to download this app on my phone WAS but Im not only because I dont want my information shared with anyone.  Thats my personal information the only thing missing is our blood type from your list
"Me. Michael Mascarenas M.A. C.A.C.III,No. 13473. I use YouTube many times daily and I personally and professionally attribute my success to this incredible tool. Gracias. Respectfully submitted, Michael B. Mascarenas M.A.C.A.C. III, No. 13473"
wont download. its refusing to download on my phone and ive been trying to download it for the past hour and a half
"Adds. You have to many adds, why charge, and I cant get rid of the info pop up"
Very nice app. Incredible app
Double plus good. Very good the only two things it lacks are yearly subscription fees and the ability to stream audio only (some live-streams arent worth the the visual data)
Video watch progress. The app has stopped tracking my progress through videos so now I have videos that Ive completed in my continue watching with only a small bit of the progress bar at the bottom of the thumbnails red
New update. This most recent update I got 11/10 basically broke the app. Nothing will load or play through. WiFi or data. Whatever they did they need to fix it
Watch later. I can&#39;t add to &#34;watch later&#34; playlist from the notification shade
"No PiP. Even when iOS allows this you still dont. Uninstalling and using the web version where Safari doesnt allow you tracking me. Oh well this was on you, Google"
A Beginner wanting to know more. Im a beginner and Im trying to learn this new app because Im an artist and I want to learn more about the app and how I can use it for personal usage and for work Was. Extremely helpful
"Its good for the most part. I watch it everyday it is an amazing way to laugh, I would personally recommend watching LuarenzSide, gloom, Azzyland, Unspeakable, and Preston. They are my personal favorites and you might like them too"
There can be only one. Its you tube . If it aint got it isnt worth watching

"NO. Stop persistently asking me to enable local network setting. It is extremely annoying I dont want to turn this stupid thing on, so dont even bother forcing me. This is my choice You are breaching and violating users privacy and I am reporting this to Apple"
Gardening. Great information and many shows to watch
Tracks me on other apps. I bought an N64 cartridge on eBay and the day after all I get are N64-related videos on my home page. I have not subscribed to any N64 game channel

Old info. Trying to find the latest posts is impossible on a phone
"Loop mode glitch on YT app. Recently all the videos that I hit the play, restart from the beginning in a endless loop. It doesnt used to happen before. Please, save my data"
Doesnt fit iPhone 11 Pro. Optimise the screen for iPhone 11 Pro then 5 stars. All of the buttons on the top are in the info ribbon and you cant access them. Rubbish app
"Absolute legend. Has made piano fun again, and is a massive inspiration to my music production and Dj ing. Honestly helped my music knowledge loads. His subscription and personal paid options are worth it"
Incredible. Its crazy that all the vids can fit into just that 1 app. Recommended to gamers
"Ad-hoc Queue. I wish I could add videos to an Ad-Hoc queue while watching. As I&#39;m watching a video, I often wish I could tap the context menu (3 dots) on another video and see the option to &#34;play next&#34; or &#34;play last&#34;, and the app would track this queue.Otherwise, this is an excellent app. I&#39;d undoubtedly give it 5 stars if this feature is implemented"
BEST APP EVER MADE. The qaulity is incredible and this app is very entraining and usefull
Excellent presentation and information. Taz gives very detailed information and styling tips. She mentions when the wig is right from the box and what she had done to make it more personal. Unfortunately when you go to the website of Raquel Welsh the wigs on the demonstration model and photo are not as attractive as she makes them look. Editors pick looks great on her nut not great on actual photos.I ordered Embrace and it has none of the curl or body the photos have. This is a disappointment. Thanks Taz for making every colour and wig look great on you.Sandi jd
"Comments appear when watching horizontally. When I watch a video in horizontal view, the comment section appears next to the video which makes the video smaller and I have to click the X to get rid of the comments. This is incredibly infuriating, please get rid of this or give us a way to turn it off"
"Buffers on premium. When using air pods / ear buds &amp; car . If I pause the audio from the devices or get into the car after using Bluetooth ear pods, the tracks nearly always wont continue to play Get the annoying spinning wheel.... have to get the phone out and go back 10 seconds. 1st world problems"

"Please fix. Hey I don&#39;t know if this is an accessibility thing or not, but the track position slider won&#39;t work for me anymore. When I want to rewind it keeps going forward instead of back. Please fix this, I rely on youtube for my classes"
Rip off. I have never subscribed to this app and I guess since I have apple they automatically have my payment info and charged my card I have reached out several times before this review and nothing back
"When will Premium be able to use PiP?. I love the app and have been using it for years. Im a premium subscriber and Im kind of getting annoyed that its been months since Picture in Picture came out on the iPhone and we still dont have access to it in the app. I dont want to have to use safari, I love the iOS app. Please add the PiP support for premium users to the app"

"No Picture in Picture support. Even with premium. Even as a premium subscriber, the only way to use Picture in Picture on iOS is to use a scriptable hack. Come on google, get your stuff together"
"Cool. This has been a great update, but can you add a search for time or track position search to enter the exact minutes and seconds in a video one wants to be at? This would work great for reentering into long videos such as livestreams and/or podcasts; long videos in general. That would make it 100 X better, thanks"
Incredible. Best app. Been using it for years. Love it
"An encyclopaedia at your fingertips. Being a retired physics teacher I can keep up to date with my subject, watching videos on black holes and time warps that are developing as I watch.

"Might be a bug. I dont know if its my phone or the app itself but no videos ever load weather Im on wifi or cellular data. It just sits there saying and error occurred, tap to retry. Again I dont know if this is just my phone or a bug but Ill change my review once its fixed"

Ever since the latest update (just a few hours ago) I havent been able to open it, when attempted it backs out and tells me This app is no longer shared with you, go to the App Store and purchase this app and when I go to the App Store it tells me to open the app, Which only leads to the same scenario. Im not sure if this is just a personal problem and I can fix it easily or if something is legitimately wrong"

"Brians review re. UTUBE. I think UTUBE is a great concept. Incredible actually. However , I wont get a subscription because one: the movies mainly the most current are all choppy. They jump around as in you get half sentences. I cant even watch them it so frustrating. Number two: I dont like much comedy but I have always enjoyed Absolutely Fabulous and there are only a few. I also like Nikita and it will say full season one and its not. Why is it so difficult to go from the very first show until the end of the series. As well, the movies are also not named properly. You think you have chosen a movie and it ends up being another. Like I said, great-fantastic concept but doesnt work as it should. I hope UTUBE can get it together  properly one day because otherwise its greatSincerely,Brian"
Incredible. Best app Ive ever used

"Say goodbye to rewind. While using voiceover, swiping up or down on the track position&#34; fastforwards the video, so now there is no longer a way to rewind.  You&#39;d have to fastforward to the end, then start the video over, then fastforward to the part you were trying to review.  I know, it&#39;s rediculous  I&#39;m so angry with myself for updating"
