Taking info. I heard that Tiktok takes information from your phone when you download the app. I really disagree with that idea as soon as I found out I deleted the app. Please change the fact that you can take anyones private information on their phone without their permission
Invasion to privacy. Stores all your data and tracks you
User info. I LOVE this app and wish I didn&#39;t have to delete it. (I am not allowed bc my dad doesn&#39;t want this app on my phone)There are rumours that this app has sent user information to the Chinese government two years ago and it is also believed that this is being continued along with all data on the user&#39;s WHOLE DEVICE and violates the privacy policy (my parents mainly believe this) overall this app is. THE. BEST
Privacy on your devices. TikTok has admitted that they hack into your technology if you have this app so dont get this app and save your personal data and personal things on your phone they know what apps you have they know all your messages on tiktok and on iMessage or on any messaging app they know all your calls so please dont get this app hope you get freaked out
Tiktok sells your information. it sells your information if your about to download dont download it
"EVERYONE PLEASE READ. Just for the people out there, always check the privacy policies on the app store. When you scroll down youll be able to see a thing that says data used to track you. From there you can see that they have access to your financial information, physical address and name plus heaps of other stuff. Im not a tech genius but isnt that a little sus? Especially because this is a Chinese company"
"Data Privacy Concern. There is a big concern about how the data collected through this app can share with others, please read the privacy policy and make the correct decision for yourself. For me its a definite no for me and my family"
TikTok. Hi Tiktok I just everyone here to know that when you make an account you access your data and media and other things that are private
"Stealing information & tracking. Look up lawsuits on google going on right now with their update people. They are secretly using all of your information including facial recognition, your financial information, browsing history, contact info, etc to track you. This is a national security issue as this app is owed by China. If you live in the US I highly recommend deleting and hopefully someone makes a better app to replace TikTok soon bc I enjoy scrolling for hours on these apps like anyone else and it was hard for me to have to delete it for the better of myself & family. Smh the world we live in, just let me enjoy dumb videos in piece"
"Sorry but. For those who dont know tiktok steals your personal information. For example when you save a video before you do Tiktok scans your face and keeps your identity in a data base. They also have access to your email, ip, address, contacts etc when downloaded. Basically a spy app. This app was made by a Chinese government basically spying on you without you knowing. Even when youre not on the app it still runs in the background. I recommend you delete it. And delete your account. &lt;3"
Information stealing. I had a lot of fun using this app until I learned that my information would be stolen. Good riddance
This app needs to go. Should be banned for privacy concerns. We need to know where our information goes
"Sorry but. For those who dont know tiktok steals your personal information. For example when you save a video before you do Tiktok scans your face and keeps your identity in a data base. They also have access to your email, ip, address, contacts etc when downloaded. Basically a spy app. This app was made by a Chinese government basically spying on you without you knowing. Even when youre not on the app it still runs in the background. I recommend you delete it. And delete your account. &lt;3 Edit: I deleted the app before I even deleted my account I was low-key scared, i dont know if this is true but tons of rumours are going around about it And I just want to be safe and you to be too. Theres a lot going on currently"
Privacy. Please stop stealing data
Data protection. Steals your info
Data privacy issue. I dont like their data privacy policies and they have to share their with their govt i would not recommend this app
this app loves keeping my personal data. tiktok-200MB base app- 2GB of my personal data stored and it doesnt even let me delete it. fun to watch but by god is it a privacy concern
"You basically gave them all your personal information. If any of you have read the privacy policy, its scary what they take. Nothing that you have on your phone is safe. Even the search history and websites youve viewed on a different app. You are not safe on this app. Delete It Now"
"They steal your data. Found out they steal so much of your personal data from your phone, you dont even need to use it. So much data that it shouldnt need to have access to and if you block the server that it sends that data to, YOU CANT USE TIKTOK. Seriously delete this app, some Chinese company is trying to hoard data for advertisers, or worse"
Steals user info. This app steals your information and lots of the content isnt worth checking out as there is no quality control
Privacy . I love this app its amazing but I heard this app track everything about you and I dont like that 
Privacy. Make sure u dont lose your SIM card to your number or you cant take down your account I have had so much trouble with trying to delete my account from tiktok and send then info they asked for and them asking for the same info 5 other times
worth it. i dont care who has my data from me using this app bring me the content
They watch you. These creators of tiktok use your data and memories from your device and use them without consent and theyre very badly using your personal information
Trash. This app collects your data with consent on whatever platform you use
Stop stealing information. This app takes your information
"Stealing information. Its a great app and I love it but I read this article on how tiktok is just a company stealing your personal info ( phone number , emails and even your drafts  ) soo didnt want to take any chances so I deleted it"
"Information stealer?. So many articles have been written about TikTok taking your information. Its affecting us. Plz stop, there are 10 year olds on this app"
Privacy. I really enjoy this app its quite entertaining. With that being said I do not appreciate the invasive tracking and data collection. Yada yada yada
good way to get your data stolen. Im really suprised people still use this app when they already know their data is being sold
"The new privacy thing ruined my account. I get there are weird people on here that we have to be careful of, but the way that Tiktok takes it upon itself to be overprotective has really annoyed me. Your parents are meant to do that, not the app itself. I find it unfair that because of a few things that have happened we all have to have unnecessary protection. People cant comment on my posts now, I dont understand the danger of comments or stitching or duets.Overall I like the people on the app but I hate the actual company"
Privacy problems. Not sure I really want TikTok stealing all my data... thats why you guys need Reddit.Redditors... assemble
Steals information about you. I TikTok is a great app if youre.  just  board. But what you probably didnt know is that TikTok steals your information about you even when you not on the app is you are instead and want to know more you can search it up and there is a Federal investigation so if you care about your information I wouldnt  download it
"Privacy concerns. There is literally no personal privacy, it tracks everything you do down to what you copy on your clipboard. Look, parents, if youre reading this and these issues made you concerned - think about it this way. Everything we consume now is selling information to make their profit, the real concern is if the way theyre storing this data is safe. Do you let your kids use Instagram? Snapchat? Facebook? Hell, the internet in general? Then dont worry, cant get worse. If they want it, let them. The app overall is a tonne of fun. Although, I honestly cant continue using an app that is collecting this much information and is based in China. In this political climate, I dont want my information being used as a weapon of war. Lets be honest, though. If they want it, theyll get it either way"
"Do you realise?. Do you realise what info this app is getting from each user, I wont be downloading this app so you can glean all my info. This is what your allowing the creators of this app to take from you:- Purchases, Financial Info, Location, Contact Info, Contacts, User Content, Search History, Browsing History, Identifiers, Usage Data and Diagnostics. If your happy letting these people know all your doing you contacts and sharing your finances with them This Is The App For You Share Away"
TikTok privacy age policy. I hate the new privacy age policy its so horrible like what the gel TikTok
DELETE IT NOW. TIKTOK TRACKS DOWN YOUR LOCATION GETS YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND TELLS PEOPLE THAT INFORMATION
Leaking privacy. Not good app to use at all. It leak your privacy just check its term and conditions before accepting them
"Data privacy..???. At first I really liked this app as it full of entertainment source and I always see stuff which I like the most......... wait what..? How is it possible...? Data stealing...? Let me explain, whenever I search something on Google and then after few hours or days that product or related to that search pops up in TIKTOK whenever I open the app the ads shows up...???? I mean what is it..? Any explanations...??? Data privacy is biggest issue nowadays"
For privacy. Privacy
"Spying on us. Although I love this app, but it violates your privacy and it stores your information and everything you copy. Delete it right now"
Who is getting their hands on my data?. Is TikTok obliged to supplying my data to a foreign government without my consent?
Invaision to privacy. Tracks what you do from other things
"Personal information. You are sharing personal images, which can be helpful things for bad peoples. Dont get this app"
"Horrible app. Its stores data and tracks you, whenever the privacy policy updates they make it less likely for you to check it, its used for way to much hate speech and spreading of misinformation, its ruining peoples mental health. If its downloaded delete it. And if its not downloaded dont get it"
DO NOT GET THE APP. They are collecting your data (email address name location) and selling it to companies if this information is breached then anyone could get your information
"Shares your data . This app has been known to share your personal data to Beijing under Chinese law. Many people in its leadership are in the Chinese Communist Party. It even admits to collecting data such as your own search history, other apps youve used, your photos and your own location. Delete this app if you have it and rate it one star and spread the message on"
Privacy accounts. Privacys account under 15 it so dumb haft of the TikTok community is under 15. And I know it for a special reason but still
"Its a great app but sketchy. WARNING READ THE POLICY BEFORE DOWNLOADINGWhen you read the policy its very sketchy  within  the first paragraph it talks about giving your information to third parties and that it uses info from messages from your phone book also users have shared that messages have been sent from their device that they didnt send in a different language. It also collects your IP address. Theres tons of sketchy behaviour but that was just a few. Do you still wanna give your name, email, age , phone number, country etc to this app?"
TikTok bad review. They use your information and share it around the world
Info stealing. The app is entertaining but the way its using our location is pathetic
Well :/. So basically TikTok is an invasion of privacy and it stands you for no reason and its just a bit of a waste of your storage like you can download it if you want but like youre just ban you and then like yeah and then theyll be a day access your phone number because its private privacy details and they also need to know your birthday and your email address and everything and thats all private information so you can download it but its a waste of storage and yeah so yeah
Privacy Invasion. Terrible app for everyone. It steals and monitors a lot of your data including your clipboard and apps installed
"Privacy. TikTok has such a great and addictive algorithm because it tracks you outside the app extensively. Also has no regulations in terms of privacy in the US. Other countries the app is available in, has to allow users to have privacy options for TikTok. We don't have that option here in the states. Won't be using"
"DONT GET TIKTOK. DONT GET TIKTOK. It takes your personal info and tracks your location. If you already have it, delete it AND your account The app tiktok, it gets your location, and goes through your phone when you leave the app. It gets your email address and many more creepy things. It stores your information in a database AND knows EXACTLY who you are. ITS HORRIBLE. It will track your location, it gets your contacts and goes through EVERYTHING. IF YOU HAVE IT ALREDY, DELETE IT"
"App knows what you do on your Phone. I use to be a big fan of TikTok, but on 2 occasions I have become aware of things immediately popping up in my feed relating directly to what I was just texting and search for on the internet.This is totally unethical and will be deleting this app today. I would advise all users to research the well documented security risks that are associated with this app before using.Very very disappointed"
"OWNED BY THE CPP . If you download this app and use it, the Chinese government has access to your information. The creators of TikTok have no choice but to hand it over whenever the government asks"
Never ever get this app. Never ever ever gets this app recently its been tracking peopleAccess your personal information
cool. i love this app so much. i just hate how it steals your information you put on it. it is not safe for personal information... other then that its really fun to use
info about tiktok TAKING info?. a ton of people have been saying tiktok STEALS your info and shares it with other companies. If you wanna use tiktok and do not wanna allow tiktok to take your info its very easy to turn off tracking and if youre not sure how heres a tutorial: [iphone only]first go to settings scroll down to tiktok press tiktok and disable  allow tracking . Now youre able to play on tiktok without having your info shared youre welcome &lt;3
"Steals data. This app steals your personal information, name, address, etc. Though, what makes this bad is that the information is then transferred over to......China. Believe it or not. Theres heavy amounts of information to support this. At this point, it is speculated that the information is also sold on the deep web. Again, including your name, location, passwords to accounts on any media app or possibly banking information. I urge you to do research for yourself on either google or YouTube. Both of those platforms will have roughly the same data as I do"
Do not download takes your data and personal stuff. They take your personal data like your name your friends your messages everything even the us government has proven that this is true Be careful guys it gives it to the Chinese government this is not a theory this is a fact  BEWARE usa  government has proven this a fact  sadly it is very addictive the app is horrible. You can download it if you want all your personal data sold to others
Steals your data. This app steals your data and gives it to people. They have also have really bad security and have allowed hackers to look at your private videos and many similar incidents to stuff like this
I am concerned. This app is great but I have heard that the creators are stealing private data from users and taking it too the government and they will track your location find your number and email so my question is... WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
Tiktoks data. I\'ve been looking around lately at apps and I looked at tiktoks APP PRIVACY tab. explain why you need our precise location?
This app sees all of your data. I have just found out the danger of TikTok it collects info and sells it to companies do not download it and delete if u have it straight away They can see what u message and the can hear everything TikTok is horrible do not download it
No respect for privacy. So it recently popes me a contact to add on tik tok which I had deleted long time back on my phone. Deleted would recommend others too. No privacy in this app
"My Account Was Hacked. This application steals your identity information. All of my social media and emails were hacked. Im still trying to recover from this hideous situation. Do not download this app unless your able to pay for the price of exposing your own personal life to the world. Its a frequency thing, be wise"
It would be nice if this app respected my privacy more. And also paid its content creators. Anyway
"Spying. TikTok is great and all, I love watching videos and making them too, but I discovered a video on YouTube about how TikTok is spying on you. Apparently it spies on all your latest searches, all the passwords you put in, and it collects personal data. I found that this was a bad thing and I did not want TikTok to keep spying on me. So I came down to a conclusion which was to delete my account and the app. For all you TikTok lovers I recommend going to a search platform and searching Does TikTok spy on you? Or something similar. Theres a video of someone telling you what it does and other things. I would have kept TikTok if only it wasnt unsafe. It is up to you to decide whether you want to keep TikTok or not. You decide"
It sells your personal information. So as somebody that uses TikTok its an amazing app but I wouldnt recommend it only because of this one thing (I heard about this)It apparently sells your information to China. I mean minus that the videos are amazing and the community is funny and nice If TikTok stops selling our information to China then Id be fully satisfied
Share all you information to 3rd party. Before you guys download this app please read T&amp;call other document I just read all policy its clearly says they can used all our information to other companies.i dont want that so I boycott this Chinese app. Thank you
I love it so much. I love TiktokPlease dont ban tiktok.If you ban tiktok I will be sssssooooo sad.But if the government does not ban tiktok still do not share your personal information.But tiktok is totally safe and is even better than most social media apps.#savetiktok
Data leak. This app is using personal data and selling for bad purposes
"This app stole data from my contacts. After downloading the app, I set my Privacy Settings to NOT allow access to my contacts. Later, scrolling through the  For You page on the app, I saw a video clearly labeled, From Your Contacts. I double checked my settings to see if I had made a mistake on setting my permissions, however, the setting was set to deny permission, but Tiktok had overridden it -w/o changing it.  Apparently, the mistake I made was in downloading the app. Apple, PLEASE FIX THIS, as these criminals of data, wont"
"Tiktok stealing your personal info. Tiktok steals your info and sells it to china, dont get this app"
"Chinese Government Spy App. Listen, I know the title is kinda odd, but trust me. If you look, a LOT is collected by TikTok. They dont even have a privacy policy They steal your info and its also PUBLIC This app blew up, and Im telling you,dont install this personal info-stealing app"
"News/dont download this app. Do NOT download this app,over a month ago,on the news , it said tiktok has been secretly saving all ur data,looking at ur drafts,saving ur ip,email,and adress,so they have scanned ur face if u have posted it,and they know excactly who you are,please be safe and do NOT download this app,i thought it was fun and i loved it until i found out it knew my location and excactly who I was. :("
"Stop storing info about us. Why are you storing data from our phones and putting it some where its not for you to know what we are keeping in our phones, its our private lives so stop. I cant post tiktok a now because my mum is scared your gonna store more info about me"
Tiktok is TERIBLE. It tracks personal information
DELETE IT RIGHT NOW. i was reading an article about tik tok and they are stealing and selling your info while useing the app You wont belive me but its true They are secretly doing it in the background data. The best way to stop that is DELETE and DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT I did already and i feal so much safer than when i read that. Be safe and delete it
uh. yall dont realize how much personal info this app takes from u 
our information being leaked. I heard that tiktok has been stealing our information. If this is true Im suing you
Dosent care about your privacy. App sucks not trustworthy and logs things when its closed delete it
"Do not use this app. This app collects data on you including search history, keystrokes, images, and apps used on your phone. Stay away to protect your privacy"
Amazing. You better leave TikTok it takes personal info
"I love the app but this . So there was this tiktoker that made a video saying how all the stuff you have on your phone (history, etc.) is said to be sent to the people who created tiktok or something, I do not want my privacy to be invaded and sent to somewhere in china, overall I love this app "
"Hey Im worried. Hi I used to have a TikTok account yet delted it last year due to the fact that it may have been deleted in australia and that we had been tracked and that stuff, just wondering before I re-download if I will be tracked/hacked and that, because Im not comfortable with TikTok being able to tap into my photos as there are pictures of me and my family and personal things. The fact you can see my contacts is weird? And that you can see my app purchases and finance, please disregard those. If you could answer me TikTok, that would be greatI loved my account however I only got on the fyp 3 times with over 100-200 videos before I went private, my friend got shadow banned, and all my other friends dont want to go un-private in case we are being tracked and TikTok isnt secure Ty for reading, and if you could inform me please about this TikTok that would be great.Verification- I think that people should be verified at 1 million followers because they have 1 million people following them, not to mention all the people who dont have accountsMultiple accounts and email- I wish I could make multiple accounts, but Id have to make a whole new email, Im not willing to do that. If you delete your account are you able to make a new one with that email? And if you forget your password, will TikTok send you an email about resetting your password?IK this is long sorry, do I need the email to be linked to this specific device? Bc I have another email Im using for this account that I will be making"
TikTok privacy. I love TikTok because its fun and it is safe I love making videos and getting likes and followers its a great thing to do The new update is great I love TikTok so much
Dont use. App collects data from your SIM card. Doesnt mention this in the privacy policy
"Okay. the app has like 10 percent of actual good content, app steals a lot of data and is not respecting users privacy. i think the government should force tiktok to change their code to not steal so much data like they are right now. otherwise delete this app"
Government Surveillance. I dont like how Tiktok creators are giving everyone intel through this app. It is a breach in our privacy. I really hope everyone deletes this app if type terms are still to give the Chinese government are private information. Really disappointing
"A shady app. This app is juts bad. If you dont agree with me thats fine. But be warned that in the private policy and the terms of service have some extremely shady things in it. For example, in the private policy is says that they can read what you text to someone in whatever app you use to message someone (you can look that up yourself). So take this as a warning before you download it"
Privacy. I really like TikTok but I dont like how the Chinese government can track us even if we have a private account and they try to get your personal information and stuff so even if you give your fake birthday or whatever they still can track you and stuff
"Privacy and censorship. I dont like Tik Toks privacy policy or the fact that the app can accumulate so much information/data about users. Also, its a known fact that the app censors the content of users from visible and sexual minorities. The concept of the app is interesting but I disagree with the way the app is managed and most importantly I value my privacy"
"Awful. I have had enough of this app, it is controlling, addictive and does not comply with what you choose as per privacy, I have removed my email from my account yet I still get updates. Chose content is inappropriate and people are generally stupid if they post on this  foul excuse of a social platform. DISGUSTING"
If you value privacy - then dont use this. It steals your information and sends it to China
"DO NOT get TikTok. I have the latest update for IOS and everytime TikTok extracts something from my clipboard it warns me with a notification, if you dont know know what that means it means that they are stealing info and possibly selling it to random people dont get TikTok it will steal your information like Ive already seen"
Serious privacy issues. Absolutely one of the worst apps on the App Store. Should be removed as soon as possible. TikTok can circumvent Apples privacy protections and uses device tracking that gives TikToks Beijing based parent company ByteDance full access to users data. Delete IMMEDIATELY
"Privacy concerns. Was using it for sometime, but few days back read about its privacy terms and conditions. Was surprised to see the details. Would recommend to please go through it carefully, and then install it. For just a video sharing platform such level of permissions are not needed. I have uninstalled it and still worried if the data at their end will be deleted"
Official TikTok review. This is a strange Chinese app that collects data and can disrupt your privacy. I dont recommend downloading it unless you want your data being sold to the Chinese government
Dont download. This app is designed to steal your information through spyware. I dont know how long itll be before they take down this review so please spread awareness
Privacy. 
Info getting shared read the it all. I love Tik tok its so fun so I would give it a 5 star review bbut when I read the terms of agreement Im not so happy about my personal info shared to other sites my privacy gone so delete tik tok like i did its all true
TikTok privacy. I love TikTok because its fun and it is safe I love making videos and getting likes and followers its a great thing to do I highly recommend it
Privacy. For messaging in TikTok youre required to add your phone number. Why is that for? Is it the purpose of the app to create a data bank?
Terrible. I have recently found out that the owners of TikTok steal and use people personal data
"Stolen. Well, I heard Tiktok steals your private information. Is that true? I had to uninstall the app because of it. I hope its not true, I dont want it to be. I gave you 2 stars instead of 1 because I am unsure if it is right or not. Thank you for reading"
Tik Tok steals your info. Do not download unless you want TikTok to sell your info
"Tiktok loves spying on you. Do not install this app, it tries to collect as much data as it possibly can to spy on you on behalf of advertisers and the Chinese government, which is heavily involved in the parent company of this app"
Sharing personal data with third party. Not happy after reading terms and conditions#corona &amp; #tiktok #came #from #same #place
Do not use this. Look up what the privacy agreement does it steals everything from your phone and everything you look at even if youre not using it
Review. Not impressimpressed with the new policy on bullying  that my account is on privacy so you let me get doxxed and thats not legal  do better tiktok
Stop stealing our data. how about you dont track literally everything i do inside and outside the app?
No way I like this. This app is stealing my personal information and all of America deleted tiktok
Steals your info. Dont download steals your info worse than Facebook
"DONT DOWNLOAD. This is a China-based app, and they will steal your information. RATE IT ONE STAR to take this app down. This is a China-based app, Tiktok has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China, according to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court on Dec 2, 2019"
Be careful. TikTok is facing a global backlash over security concerns. Your data and personal details may be sent to the Chinese Communist Party
Privacy. Wow
"Please dont download. Hey internet peoples, before I say anything else u am NOT a Karen mum. Im a 15 y/o child. I just wanted to say that TikTok does STEAL FILES and has admin permissions on your phone. Of course do your own research but before you download, keep in mind that if you are slightly concerned that apple knows more about you than anyone else and can accurately predict some crazy things like the likelihood of you being a future te-ror-ist. I would be extremely concerned about a Chinese company knowing the exact same information about you, which gets transmitted by unsecured wire connections"
"Have you read the privacy statement. Why  We collect and process, which includes scanning and analyzing, information you provide in the context of composing, sending, or receiving messages"
"This app is horrible. This app steals data without consent and is plain awful. I stand for Reddit, tiktok trash"
"Personal Information being taken?. Ive heard that the company is stealing personal information this so happens to be confirmed by anonymous that they are Chinese spys upon the app, if so this app should be banned and deleted as it is in India"
Privacy issues. Can you please confirm if TikTok sends data back to China and what that data discloses? I heard from a United States Congressman that there are heaps of data points shared with China more than most other apps
Creepy. I TikTok is a great app but its very very creepy. They take all your information and store it in Chinese government I deleted immediately after I found out this because I used to have a count it is not OK for this. It is invading our privacy and it needs to be addressed
"Scammers. Do not allow TikTok tracking your phone - do not put your phone number in details just email only  thats how protecting your privacy. They blocked my posting many times with random reasons cos you from America , Canada, Australia who is telling about true human rights in China"
Stupid. Tired of seeing things that arent in my language. And if you make me update the app again just to use it Ill delete and never use tiktok again. Dont know why all these social media apps make you update when nothing changes. Makes one think theyre slowly trying to sell your information the more they can find out about you
has so many things that track you. just scroll down on tiktoks app store page and youll see everything that they collect and probably give to other companies
Idk what has happened but it has. People have been reporting in YouTube saying you take our data that is not cool I love this app but that just made me delete it nobody should steel peoples private info
"All your information is being stolen. This app literally keeps records of every single thing you click on your phone simply by having in installed. On tiktok or not, Id youve ever typed passwords or personal information while this app is installed then China has it. This is app is disguised as something good but its just a massive Chinese scheme to destroy their enemy countries from within"
Privacy. Its a fun and great app but it would be better if u added more privacy
Ummmmmm. Apparently this app is controlled by the Chinese government. Stealing your information? Listening to private information ? Faking phenomenons?
"Hey Im worried. Hi I used to have a TikTok account yet delted it last year due to the fact that it may have been deleted in australia and that we had been tracked and that stuff, just wondering before I re-download if I will be tracked/hacked and that, because Im not comfortable with TikTok being able to tap into my photos as there are pictures of me and my family and personal things.

IK this is long sorry, do I need the email to be linked to this specific device? Bc I have another email Im using for this account that I will be making. I also think its silly that u cant make multiple accs"
SPYWARE - DELETE APP NOW. The Chinese government steals your data + personal info and uses it against you
"Cyber security threat and terrible for your mental health. As someone who has used tiktok for about 1 year now I have only just started to realise all of the negative effects it has had on my health. An example of this is being on it for hours before i go to bed until about midnight which has caused me to wake up later. When you look at scientific studies it shows that tiktok shortens attention spans due to both how the algorithm works and how shortform content like tiktok is.Tiktok is also a gigantic cyber security threat to every single country, the chinese government have access to all of tiktoks incredibly invasive data, if you look at the privacy policy you see things like them being able to use your search history, videos of yourself(including drafts) and terms of comments. A lot of people that I know when they hear about these privacy breaches dont understand why it is so bad so to people like that, if a company has BILLIONS of peoples, private info, comstant location, isp etc. That company then sells that data and then a random person in the world knows almost everything about you, and in the case of tiktok this information is used by the government as a weapon against government officials and anyone with power.If you dont think thats bad enough a lot of the money taken from tiktoks revenue is by the chinese government and they have killed millions in modern day concentration camps so you arent supporting anyone good, i know that google and facebook arent good either but at least they arent war criminals"
"A Big Danger. This App Allows Other People To Access Personal Infomation, Even With The Settings. I Advise You NOT To Download This App, Watch Tik Toks On YouTube"
Privacy concerns. Not confident about the privacy
"DONT GET IT. Recently people have been getting messages from TikTok saying they know where the person lives. It can access your personal information, it knows what apps you have been on, it tracks your messages you send on there and it can see your search history. There is a lot more. If you want more information then search up Delete TikTok on YouTube and select the video with the title Uninstall TikTok now by Liyan Channel. Please do NOT get this app if you want you and your family to be safe"
Data cautious beware. This app tracks and uses far more personal data than needed. I am not using it for this reason
"Care for privacy. If you care for your privacy, dont use this app. Simply nothing but chinese govt analytics tool"
Love TikTok. Everyone talks about USA taking it down TikTok has no personal info on me I feel completely safe having TikTok downloaded to my phone If something should be taken down it should be Facebook Several times Facebook has had problems with our info being leaked out I hope you stay forever TikTok 
"Terrible company behind this app. TikTok has an allure, but once you start to realize just how much they censor and suppress content from what they consider undesirables  LGBT, older people, people with disabilities, unattractive, overweight, etc  your account will be suspended over the tiniest infraction of their long list of things you cant do, or your videos will be suppressed and never shown. China also gets ALL this data to spy on you, too. This app should really be removed from the App Store"
Its a great app but Im worried about my privacy. Over all its a great app but Im concerned about my privacy
"Fast and Furious Thats tiktok. Tiktok is the most fast paced social media platform to date. You will get hypnotized by all the content that the algorithm believes you may like.Hours of scrolling down at all the potentially entertaining videos. And you may also find people following you and receive quick small time fame.The trouble is that tiktok is the app that will keep giving you content. Its a never ending machine of media thats being pushed on to you whether you know it or not.I found myself getting addicted to interacting with the app. From posting content and gain likes and follows to commenting my thoughts and feelings. And there was this high Id get. I felt this validation and short term satisfaction.I also felt burnout and depressed when my hopes and expectations were not met multiple times. I felt real sick of it all. Id constantly delete the app so I wouldnt have access. But Id just download the app again and the vicious cycle would repeat itself.  Fortunately I eventually got blacklisted. I lost a lot viewership as a result. That really got me down in the dumps. I couldnt get that usual high I was so used to at that point.In the end I got banned for good. I got in trouble with what I posted. Copyright music/this japanese gameshow with a pornstar/and a old video game commercial with scifi guns (that got me in the most trouble).In conclusion, tiktok is a super fast sort of information sharing place. You see so much so fast that it really messes with your mind. I find myself in a zombie state. Always consuming information. There is a lot of garbage videos youll end up seeing whether you like it or not. And losing your patience in general.Oh and theres some other cons. Like nowadays I get random phone calls from other states. I just assume the worst. That tiktok took my private information like my phone number and sold it to third party companies. Dont have proof, but meh. All in all, tiktok is a extremely overwhelming and fast paced place. And its not for me, I am just another sucker wholl stick to watching dog and cat videos on youtube. Congrats of you read all this. Your reward is free knowledge. How much is it worth? Thats all relative to you I suppose"
"TikTok is a pro-CCP company that censors any pro-Hong Kong content. This app has censored many pro-Hong Kong / Tianimen square content. Not to mention, the app itself is owned by a Chinese company, which has close links to the inner communist party of China. The TOS states that this app will collect as much data from you as physically possible, and most likely sells it back to the CCP. Anything from keystrokes to pictures that youd never want to leak, it is absolutely not okay. In fact, US government officials and military personnel are not allowed to use TikTok at all, because of this data collecting. Please do not use this app, there is a reason why the US government considers it a security threat"
"Online Privacy Issue. Best social media platform out there Users can be creative, supportive and find a fun and loving community No other social media platform makes you feel safe and respected to JUST BE YOURSELF as TikTok does TikTok IS FABULOUS however I just learned that UrleBird.com is a mirror image of TikTok that sells things off the content of TikTok. I did not give consent for my content to be used on this site and I would like TikTok to dismantle UrleBird.com as soon as possible. Its not right that this site is using our content to sell product that we do not agree with or consent to. Please consider taking UrleBird.com down and destroying the content on it. Thank-you"
The greatest app. People are so friendly and TikTok values your privacy
Leak data information. It is unacceptable
"This trash invaded your privacy. This app is just another piece of trash that China came up with to spy on the world. Notwithstanding all the mental health issues that unethical, greedy, corrupt social media platforms like TikTok create in our society through online interactions that are fickle, narcissistic, shallow and gives women and men a place to needlessly sexualise and cheapen themselves to the rest of the world. To merely have this app on your phone is a sure fire way to know you have very serious mental health problems. Not forgetting what I said earlier about China creating TikTok under the badly disguised image of an independent Chinese company to gather every single users private information and spy on them, although at this rate most people are aware of the fact that the Chinese government owns and controls TikTok. Download this social media cancerous parasite of an app at your own risk"
dont download tiktok. they spy on you they know your Private information and more
Breaches Security. Uninstall right now. This app tracks my location from my sim card instead of location services. It didn&#39;t ask for my permission to do so and is not mentioned anywhere on its documentation. It is very fishy why a video sharing app should need it. It might also be collecting data about my calls as well. You cannot ask for information as it is a chinese app (no racism just fact) regulated by their government
Can track you?. I was looking for updates and it said Data used to track you. This freaked me out and dose it really do that? If so Im deleting the app and my device.Over all good app
"tiktok is ruining our society. tiktok is taking your personal information, your text messages, photos, everything and using them. they are lowering our attention span"
"Do not download. It steals your data. If you do get this app after seeing this, read the terms and conditions. There is stuff they are not telling you. Please do not get this app"
"Privacy. Search for some info about your Tik tok privacy in google, they actually spy you"
"Spyware used on you. This is app is literally spying on you. So unless you want a Chinese company tracking your information, stay away from this app"
"Better data privacy and Id be fine. I think this app is fine. Im not mad at it for its functions, I am mad at it for transferring data back to China reducing the security for average folk. I really wanted to love this, but the insecure data prevents me from recommending it"
Good app kinda. I like this app but I deleted it because I heard the government watches you and goes through all your stuff and collects all your information
"SHUT IT DOWN. Tiktok takes all your private information and when your not on the app it still runs even if you close it collecting your email, location and other stuff and it even scans your face please shut this app down"
Awful use of data. This company is selling your data
DELETE THIS APP NOW. Ive heard that this app has been recording peoples personal information
TikTok. Hi devaIve been using TikTok but I had to stop because of privacy reasons. Can you please not sell peoples data? Then I&#39;ll rejoin. From @ytmeowy
Its horrible. Whenever you use it someone gets all your information delete this app
BEWARE. THEY ARE STEALING OUR INFORMATION
"Privacy thingy. Hey, i rlly like tiktok and all. But im pretty sure there use to be a privacy setting enabling you account to not come up when searched for. I would really appreciate if you could add this back. :)"
"I hat this app. People are disrespectful, and this app is taking peoples datas"
This app sells your data. The owner of this app aka the chinese owner sells your data on the darkweb and passwords etc I recommend deleting this app right away unless you have good a good vpn etc that saves ur data
Keep our identity safe. Many would say dont do tiktok because they may hack your accounts. Please Tiktok keep us all safe from identity thief and please keep it wholesome for all user. Filter those that are showing their nudity or using inappropriate words or misleading information because there are also kids using it. I would still give you 5 star because you help me with my anxiety and depression
TikTok is not a good idea. Most damaging and horrible app ever created. Personal data collection terms are incredibly invasive and will negatively affect your life and overall well being
Spying. Tiktok is spying on us and stealing our private info
Stealing privacy. This is one of the worst app i have ever use this. Because they are taking all your privacy and location from other app also. Please guys be safe from this app
"Sharing ur personal information. Tiktok is a chinese app as we all know. What you might not know that the Chinese government has full access to your information in the app. By 2030, china is trying to become superpower in Artificial Intelligence and by getting our personal and sensitive info, location, likes/dislikes, preferences, china is getting all the information to influence us without our consent. Moreover, if u have any doubts, just search for which is the  parent company of tiktok, and u will understand everything"
Privacy issue. If you like to get your data stolen by China then this is the app for you
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app takes your IP adress,Creditcard,Phone #,Pictures,The passwords you own, Do not download or else your Info will be Leaked to the world"
"Explained. Ok so the app is made by a Chinese company, the company itself means no harm. However, the Chinese government can see and monitor every app that is made in China. Therefore the Chinese government can get your personal info. This is because they want to make sure their countrys citizens are safe. However this information about us could be used in a bad way. I would recommend getting funamate instead. I hope this was helpful.~Yui"
Hack. Got hacked on this app someone stole my account and my personal videos I reported it multiple times in the las month and it just says under review. Tiktok is not taking privacy issues seriously. Very unsafe app
It hands your data to random people who dont need it. I didnt use this app much as it is so the fact it wants my data to hand around like a baby I deleted it straight away if you havent got this app yet do not get it
"Tik Tok. There  have been rumours about Tik Tok stealing your information and data whilst you watch the 15 second videos. I was quite worried that the app has been stealing my info. So for a while I had the app deleted from my phone. But, I did some more research and it turns out the app actually just steals the same amount of info and data any other social media app does. So there is nothing really to worry about.Overall, a really great and funny app"
"Why this privacy. Hey, Why you changed this privacy policy? Did anyone asked you guys. I had a bad breakup and my ex forgot to block me from Tiktok..i was so happy to see her videos and now you change the privacy settings. You are such a bad. I hate you guys. How i gonna see her? why you did this to me?"
Chinese spyware. This app sells your personal information to the Chinese government. Dont get
It stills information. My Id was shared with so many people. And much more
"Data. Look I love tik tok its honestly a great app, good memes and just funny stuff. But its alarming to me of how much of my data the app actually has access too. I understand we live in a world where data and privacy no longer belongs to us but still I sometimes search things up on my computer and all of a sudden similar things pop up on tik tok... they also can literally go through anything on my phone they have access to all the phone hardware. Overall great app just stop stealing so much of our data and breaching our privacy.(Im talking to you China) "
Good as an app but takes all data. The app itself is fine but the amount of data they take horrendous and absurd u can look in the data they take mentioned by Apple below plus the fact they can see your OS they paste your clipboard know whether your jailbroken the devices on your network and other stuff it is ridiculous do NOT get the app if u want all your data stolen
Bad content it hacks your account and range your all info. not good. and it&#39;s very disgusting app i used ever. no Tik tok. virus in your phone
I got banned . Why is asking for our private information it should only asked for a date of birth and thats it and our username that you want to do but it asked for all of our private information which is really bad I hate this app I got banned I lost 300 followers
"Steals your data then sells it to the Chinese Communist Party. If you download this app, you are supporting the suppression and indoctrination of billions of people as well as the torture and organ harvesting of tens of millions of people.It is an abomination that this bastion of Chinese cyber infiltration and cultural manipulation was ever allowed into the AppStore"
"Data. TikTok is just shit, they take your personal info and sell it to china"
The worst. People are saying TikTok can know your location and personal information. Even my teacher says this. When reporting someone it does not take it seriously and that when I first got TikTok it does not allow me to make an account
Avoid using this app. To all my fellow Tik-Tok Users around the Federal government of United Stated have ordered to uninstall Tik-Tok on all its employees Personal and Government Devices. If it involves government I feel there is a suspicious threat of data getting leaked from our device. please uninstall this app immediately to safe guard your Privacy
"NO GET THIS APP. No one download this app it was confirmed by tiktok that they give all your information to the Chinese government which is a huge risk for America and Canada thats why there banning it, so tiktok gives ur up address your contact information, including your home address, and it is not safe to use. I deleted the app right away when I heard about all this. And also they collect data from ur device like your device model number, what other apps you use besides tiktok and they collect the data from those apps, such as Snapchat or instagram. Everyone be careful and delete this app"
"Large security risk. Leaks data like its no big deal. I question the users of this app who think it is secure in any way, shape, or form"
Privacy alert. Chinese app ... shares your personal data with Chinese companies.. do not use the app
"info. lol, this app is so trash it just steals your personal info. if you are wanting to get this app dont, its filled with cringe, homophobes, racist people, sexist people and more. I hate this app, I hope it gets deletedps its a Chinese spyware "
"someone looking out for yalls safety. DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD. THIS. APP. PLEASE READ THISthis app (tiktok) is used by the chinese goverment to spy on your phone. it has added to your location,messages,camera,location,microphone,emails,phone numbers, everything it has access to these because when you download the app and make your account, it asks you for permission to use your contacts, camera,microphone,photos, and location. (literally you dont even need to use your location on this app so BIG RED FLAG.) this is 100% real even the usa congress goverment encouraged users of the app to delete it. please everyone do not use this app jsut for ur safety"
Why I dont like TikTok. I said the writing and posting TikTok when I was seven and I thought it was cool and then I figured out that they just want your FMH information and they just want everything that you can get out of you so they can just hack into your phone and stuff thats just what happened to me they asked me for my date of birth my signature my you know personal stuff and I just almost got banned but then I told them I would report them but didnt start so these just stopped and then I just yeah so I hope you guys just take care of that please and thank you they just want your info
Delete      ASAP . this app is stealing all our information without our consent including our locationTikToK app is pullng data from our sim to show us relevant language videos - thats crazy
Unnecessary censorship and tracking. This app is a nifty form of privacy invasion and piracy. Its the western equivalent of WeChat
Didnt Like it. Used it for days. Then I came to know that they have all the access to our data and they can or I think they are manipulating our data against us. Idont  want them to use my data so delete it
"security management. literally it tracks you and finds all your data and info, sends it to a software. and its so bad it makes people want to commit suicide and silences lgbtq+ people by banning them and deleting their videos"
Privacy and settings needs help. My acc got hacked and that person removed all my followers and deleted my most viewed and liked videos. And I accidentally made my age under 13 and now tiktok restricted my setting and privacy so no one can duet... now no one likes my videos. But overall its ok. And has great content... from other user ofc
"myeeerere. cool app, but I don&#39;t like getting my data leaked to the Chinese government"
Ello. Tik Tok can take personal information off ur devices      The truth
Privacy is no go. Such a great tracking app for Chinese government. Well done
Steals data. Nobody should have this Chinese spyware installed on their phone. Before downloading look up how much info it takes from you and how much is necessary
Tiktok is fraud. Please delete your accounts they are taking your information and they scan your face .even when your not on the app they can see what your doing on your phone or tablet/iPad.if you dont believe me check on google
"Tracking and homophobic/transphobic. This app tracks its users and take their info, its also knows to delete account with lgbtq+ stuff and usually when an account talks about china, the app tracking you, Lgbtq+ stuff, calls someone out, or has very left views and spreads info about what the government is doing it deletes their account"
"Stop leaking drafts. Im very concerned about the privacy and service of of some users using this platform. It has been brought to my attention that somehow, a tiktok users drafts have been leaked to the public. This is very concerning and not something that should be taken lightly. Its disgusting and an absolute disgrace, nobodys private videos should be shown to the public. Its very stupid that the workers for this app somehow let someones private content become leaked. Its horrendous and makes me sick. Nobody EVER consented to letting those videos become leaked. So I ask with all due respect, watch your platform. CAREFULLY"
Awful app. This app sells your data you dont want that the commis will have your data
"Creepy app. Why is everything you do/own/have linked to you on this app except for usage data? Also, I know it is supposed to be good marketing but this app drags you in and absorbs your brain. By getting this app you are not only committing to being tracked but you are also going to have to be prepared to give all of your time to the app; however, it is a good way for people to express themselves, but then people get hate for doing so. TikTok also shortens your attention span so if you are like me and care about your life then you will delete this app because you dont need it"
"BAD UPDATE. if i am above 13 i should be able to control my privacy. tiktok has made my account private and i am about 15, ever since the new update my tiktok will stop on random pages and i have to close tiktok and restart it. bad update, didnt think"
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app consumes your info and data.Running by the Chinese government, they can spy on you"
Keep our identity safe. Many would say dont do tiktok because they may hack your accounts. Please Tiktok keep us all safe from identity thief and please keep it wholesome for all user. Filter those that are showing their nudity or using inappropriate words or misleading information because there are also kids using it. I would still give you 5 star because you help me with my anxiety and depression. You are one medium to keep me distracted from panic ir depression. And I found new friends
"Do not use. If you value your privacy, do not download"
Huge privacy concerns. tiktok has been allegedly selling pictures on private accounts to companies meaning that anyone can access tiktoks just made for family and friends
Urlebirdy is taking my info. Yh the reason I gave this review was because another company has my info and I am not happy that they arent getting rid of it
Whys it take my financial data?. Great addictive app but would like to know what financial data its taking off my phone. Ive never purchased anything on TikTok or seen a way of doing that
Scam. This app is a big scam it steals all your data secretly. Delete it now
Great app but security tools needs improvement. TikTok has an array of amazing content creators sharing information on various subjects from house cleaning to mental health. The app itself is pretty straightforward to use. The reason I rated 4 stars is because privacy and security tools need improving. I have also found the support team were absolutely no help when reporting a troll account using my name
Terrible. It steals your mobile data and takes all your personal information DO NOT GET IT
Follow me Review. The only problem I had was getting a response or trying to contact anyone to explain to me how a post going viral was removed for breaking community guidelines and my own YouTube audio was flagged as copyright infringement when I made it myself which i didnt back up to the cloud and lost what I made with open source copyright software which even TikTok uses I wouldnt want to find a clone that has better customer service than TikTok I had YouTube reinstall one video after it was silenced I didnt even request a review and I only have two subscribers so they go through everything to make a fair and safe experience TikTok has experience in regulation of there own growth and information gathering thats how they make there profit and any app that can access an exchange or transfer of information like posting or sharing to another site shows they use loopholes in open source software and there combined contracts if you notice no other social media platforms are advertising there logos and you cant find a picture of them together on the internet and thats why they are banned in some countries yet still have there content and gathering there information through third party apps like video editor apps that require your financial information before you even get to try it not a one time purchase and are made in countries with political tensions with each other and any to become popular and create a bridge of communication where there government leaders cannot for whatever reasons I hope TikTok realizes the unique position they hold and hold a little more responsibility in there allowing anyone to claim someones content is not community guidelines and have no actual real follow up on real complaints of bullying or offer an option of a review they dont have the capability or experienced public relations that cross borders literally and the content they have no knowledge of like anti government groups posting information through TikTok placing TikToks information at top dollar for any company or government to gather information on people fighting for democracy and are in there revolution of the people how can an algorithm be the one making decisions based on profits and growth of there brands being the goal or is it to gain political and personal information to control the world economy with algorithms made by who knows and arent available yet if you used the open source contracts the use in third party connections they gather there competitors information and have a majority on the market able to influence direction of information in more then just entertainment maybe this review will get me a real response @FLOCK_OF_ANOTHER #therimyngod
Spying on you. Dont download it. It will spy on you guys. It will take data from your phone. May be one day it will clean ur banks too
TikTok is a scam. It steals your data and takes it
TikTok is Spyware. If you dont value your personal information and youre okay with your private information in the hands of the Chinese (and probably Chinese government) go nutsI enjoyed this app until they were ONCE AGAIN caught taking private information through underhanded means. Apple caught them red handed. Should be removed from the app store
Just dog water. Why is asking for our private information it should only asked for a date of birth and thats it and our username that you want to do but it asked for all of our private information which is really bad I hate this app
"Privacy. This app is very entertaining, but it is not very secure. It can see your face, which is wayyyyyyy bad. So I don&#39;t recommend this app"
Tik Tok. There  have been rumours about Tik Tok stealing your information and data whilst you watch the 15 second videos. I was quite worried that the app has been stealing my info. So for a while I had the app deleted from my phone. I am still worried that Tik Tok might be stealing private info and data and I am stuck whether if I should download the app againBut otherwise than the fact Tik Tok might be banned in the USA and could potentially be stealing information without consent the content on there is really funny and entertaining
Safety and privacy. I want to be able to take my phone number out. Ive been getting calls from all across my province and I dont like it. I dont feel safe on tik tok anymore
Dont get this app. SPY-WARE from the China Gov. This app is a data collection service disguised as social media. The Chinese government is using this app to track all of you and gather all the data about you and your friends/family.I REPEAT. DONT GET THIS SPYWARE
"Delete this app now. Not because its stealing your information, but because its "
Horrid filth. This app is used by the Chinese to access your private information. Do not install this filthy application
"They sell info to the Chinese government. Tik tok has admitted to sending information to the Chinese government and selling it, DELETE THIS APP"
"What Tiktok is hiding from you. They get information about people on this app and is owned by China 10 cents thing DONT download this app for your safety,"
"Tik tok is the best app for creators to get Paid. Pros: Tiktok overall is a fantastic app when it comes to growing your account and being discovered. you can literally have zero followers & Go viral By following a few simple Steps. If you are serious about your craft and brand, You can Build out a Blue Print to compensation Thru Tiktok from Going 1K and now during live stream you can receive gifts from supporters with a 50/50 split (tik tok cut), 2nd you reach 10k followers you can apply for the tik tok creator fund earning money off your content (not on facebook twitter or instagram do you make money off your content for years  Only youtube with ads) to the big advance At 100k you can apply for the tik tok Market Place where Big businesses can reach out to you if they need you for promotion. This trajectory can literally replace your current 9 to 5 and never have to work again. that's how innovative and forward thinking this app is. Follow @scoobyrawpodcast @americancloutman to turn your passion into a business Im living proof Cons: like most social media apps or huge conglomerate companies worth billions of dollars there is no dedicated customer service video calling live chatting or call center to contact for any of your issues. there is a huge flaw in their artificial intelligence & not enough humans on the pay roll. I literally took TickTock three days to respond to a live stream mayor a live stream or who committed suicide how can you be worth billions of dollars and not have a direct contact when it gets to this extreme level. What exactly is the face recognition and breach of privacy for if you can't even catch suicide instantly or at least within 24 hours as I digress . when it comes to their reporting systems especially during live stream where the coded bias is based on how much the viewer can aggravate the user to force the algorithm to agree with whatever report is sent in and cause a content violations or worst A 7 day or longer ban with literally ZERO EXPLANATION MOST TIMES. Only because I'm a social media marketing genius I've created over 12 pages in which I've gotten to a high enough social status where trolls and hackers don't affect me as much but 99.9% of TickTock does not have the gifts that I possess so this causes a huge problem amongst the live stream and content creator community you need a dedicated customer service center. Conclusion: tiktok is now rivaling youtube as the greatest competition to the transformation of wealth For creators world wide in the world you can actually turn your passion into a profitable business beyond your current salary 10 Fold with the right amount of dedication and motivation knowledge and drive"
Private Account. My Account is private and still you guys are sharing my information on the Internet please get this sorted out
Wouldnt download. The Chinese government is taking your personal data from this app
PRIVACY NIGHTMARE. This app is basically malware
Tiktok review. I like this app. Hope the app developers dont steal the data from my phone
"Good but needs some changes. Ok so tiktok is a great app but the privacy setting isnt the best, Im trying to change my number that backs up my account but I cant because that is my old number and no longer have access to it and my email is already taken by another account. Its really annoying and scared that I will lose my account one day if I forget my password. So please tiktok change the setting make it easier to change things up :)"
"Zuckerberg no.2. This app steals your data. (search history, contacts and your texts/dms) TikTok has been banned in numerous countries including America for spying on you. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
TT. Get to post things. And good privacy
WARNING PEOPLE. TICTOK IS SPYWARE THEY STEAL YOUR DATA
Asha Huntsmans Review. I love TikTok They have made a lot of improvement on there privacy policy and more Thanks so much for helping our community and gain a lot of love and helpful tips 
"UNINSTALL THIS APP ASAP . This app steals all your personal information and even credit card details, your IP address and provides a lot of intelligence data to the CCP Just run as far as you can from this app &amp; save yourself and your privacy"
Stop stealing our data. Stop it
"Tiktok is spying on you. I recommend that you delete tiktok due to the recent discoveries that tiktok are taking your information such as, your location, search history and even the sites you visit and sends it to bejing there is a reason the USA  government is considering BANNING it"
"Tiktok is cancer in app form. Data collection service for the Chinese government, only fools use this trash. If you claim to care about human rights and freedom and BLM and LBGTQ rights, etc., but continue to use Tiktok, youre just a hypocrite and part of the problem"
Stalkers. People stalk you and can access youre personal information inside and outside of the app would not recommend
Rubbish. This app is a waste of time content is not filtered no privacy
Stealing people information. This app is from the COVID 19 starters and is stealing people information and personal stuff so if you want to protect your information NEVER USE THIS APP
"Dont download. TikTok has been sued for selling minors information, and has a pedophile ring. This app is compromised, extremely dangerous for minors, and even adults. Having it on your phone puts you at risk for all your info, including contacts, search history, pictures and such to be sold off to some random corporate. Thats where TikTok is making money"
do not get this app. they steal your information they take everything you do even when you&#39;re not on the app this is the worst app in the world 
"Entertaining. Dont get rid of TikTok, the government is already watching you through your phone and all your other social media apps "
"really?. its really dumb that i cant post whatever i want to my PRIVATE posts. currently banned from posting bc i made a video on tik tok and posted it to private simply to save it to my camera roll. if youre gonna make a deal about it let me save it straight from drafts and not have to post it at all. the privacy policy on this app is dumb ive read it over and over again and have not been able to understand half of it as theyre giving us as little detail as possible while still abiding by the law, this is a kids app you think they know what those privacy policies mean when worded like that? either let me post whatever i want to private and review it when i change the privacy settings on a post or let me save straight from drafts. the whole policy system is messed"
This is app Spys on you. This app spys on you it records everything that happens on your phone and sends it to the FBI and if anything bad happens you will be reported to the FBI
"Chinese spying. It literally takes all of your personal stuff, everything on your phone your search history your photos your texts everything and keeps it it doesnt sell but if the Chinese government wants the info they just take it and you accept all of this because it is hidden away in the terms of agreement"
This app is stealing your private information. This app is stealing your data and spying on you. If I was you delete the app rn
"Its not too bad. Ok listen I know that this may track some of your data or whatever but theres Apps made for literally protecting your personal Data like an App Jumbo that I would definitely recommend, but besides that it really isnt too bad. Because it can be entertaining and yes I know there can be a lot of toxicity and inappropriate stuff but not like your just gonna search up hot naked lady, (I hope )In the App but there are still some TikTokers who help with anxiety,depression,panic attacks,etc. And some very nice people on the App. And on this App you can make new friends,make videos, and you can even watch your friend/ familys Videos. So for me this App is a must have especially on a boring Sunday afternoon, Have a great day,"
"Dont install this app. If you care about your privacy, dont install this app as it does nothing but spy on you"
DELETE NOW. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WATCH YOU THOUGH THIS APP IT WILL KNOW YOUR PERSONAL INFO AND IF U DONT TRUST ME SEARCH IT UP ON YOUTUBE DONT TAKE THIS RISK IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE IT TELL THEM TO DELETE IT NOWWWWWW
My new Friend. Just this app and the way information is for all
"This app is designed to destroy your life. This app destroys your attention span and has been proven in scientific studies to increase rates of depression all while collecting every bit of data it can about you. It collects your likes and dislikes, what apps you have on your phone, your search history on apps other than itself, keystrokes on other apps, your text messages and contacts. This app will collect every single spec of information about your life then turn around and hand it to the Chinese government on a silver platter. TikTok will say this is because of Chinese law rather than the app being heavily developed by the Chinese government and having many government officials on their board of executives. I know this review will most likely be buried under artificial 5 star reviews or just deleted but if I can keep one person from downloading this app or make one person delete this app Ill consider it worth it. I beg you please do not download this app for the betterment of yourself as a human being and to protect the privacy of your daily life from the prying eyes of the Chinese government"
Keep this app if you want your personal info to go to the ccp. Ccp is the chinese government. Delete this
"Its not too bad. Ok listen I know that this may track some of  your data or whatever but theres Apps made for literally protecting your personal Data like and App Jumbo that I would definitely recommend, but besides that it really isnt too bad. Because it can be entertaining and yes I know there can be a lot of toxicity and inappropriate stuff but not like your just gonna search up hot naked lady, and well if the App but there are still some TikTokers who help with anxiety,depression,panic attacks,etcAnd some very nice people on the App. And on this App you can make new friends,make videos, and you can even watch your friend/ familys Videos. So for me this App is a must have especially on a boring Sunday afternoon, Have a great day,"
Dont use tiktok. DO NOT USE THIS APP IT STEALS UR INFO
"Pls read. Good app overall, I think it should definitely have more privacy options for example if you dont want to see inappropriate content there should be a setting for that I think a lot more people would let their teenagers get the app if it was more private and had more restrictions on what people can post aka. No evident inappropriate footage, No posting pictures or videos of violence ect I like TikTok but it needs to have more ways of banning people"
"Useless, steal my information. Its not safe at all, steal all your data"
Spyware and bad content. Full of fake content and is a spyware taking personal information. How is this even aloud on the AppStore?
"Theres no privacy. Its keeps asking me for my phone number & theres lots of people making fun on disability, shame on you, Im reporting this to Apple"
Privacy. Before I was able to put on diets and everyone could comment on my videos. And them TikTok put me on private And I cant put my comments back on or duets and its really frustrating This is such a stupid rule and its so annoying
"I luv this app. I really like this app, but... I heard that you guys steal information, this breaks my heart. I cant live without this, but... I have to move on, why do you do this? You broke my heart... I thought I was safer here, the most funnest thing to me... bye"

milenials. this app SPYS ON YOU AND GIVES YOUR INFORMATION TO THE CHINESE COMMIE GOVERMENT
AVOID DOWNLOADING. Complete trash. This application disgusts me. There is not a single place on the web I can browse freely without being harassed by this garbage apps advertisement. Avoid downloading this application at all costs it may seem all fun and games at first but you have no idea how your data is being collected by the developers... who also happen to have enough money to spread their ads on every platform available on the web. This application invades every aspect of your privacy
"Creepy. They take your personal info and sell it to other websites Delete it now If your dont believe me, check the privacy and terms policy"
Trash and sneaky. The worst app on earth it also gives away private info to the Chinese government so if you like your personal info dont buy it
I used to love it until. So now there r a lot of hackers and scammers that are dangerous a lot of reports saying tiktok steals ur information and sends it to China and a lot of kids go on it including me I just dont think its possibly safe anymore please update privacy settings and add something that only the owner know like an old teachers name or face animal please Ive deleted the app cause of my young age thank you
not worth it. really bad disgustingly censoring info and using personal data
Literally delete it. Its so inappropriate and they take your personal stuff and they track you down and ban you from entering your own personal account ban this app the creators are dumbasses
China. TikTok sells your information to China and people on the dark web. They spy on you and collect data from other apps. Dont download if you value your privacy
"SORT THIS OUT NOW. Theres bots on this app, they like your comments and if you click on the link in their bio they can track you/leak your information. I deleted the app in fear. Sort. This. Out. This is a dangerous app be careful. But the app is good itself, just be careful of these bots"
"It steels youre data. Delete this app, they sell your data to Arab countries and stuff is that what you want "
Why let the PRA have your phone data ???. The Chinese government basically own this app now .So why have on it your phone?????
"please report the user. I tried to report a user for leaking my address and personal information , but tiktok didnt do anything about it"
Tiktok is a virus. There is proof in the terms and conditions that they can send your data to the Chinese government. In addition random people can download your info. Do we want this for our kids
"This app is full of misleading information,racism,bullying,and degeneracy. I sincerely hope this app will get deleted permanently from all devices, its filled with racism and bullying, people telling people to kill themselves and young children getting harassed if you do go on this app look out for misleading information because its laws ip 50% of its content"
Its all lies. You people like Im never downloading tiktok stop being such eggs because when they share the same video of another platform its the funniest video and platform doesnt make you stupid its yourself thinking that a platform is not up to your standards grow up you twits.....And for all the people saying they are spying on you like Im a 29 old man whos had three back operations I literally go to work come home playing some games eat dinner and tiktoks like you if think youre not being Spied already on how stupid are you P.S Im sorry in advance if youre the person spying on me and you see my search history trust me seek help break the stigma Much love for tiktok

Tiktok track you. Tiktok steal your data so they know where you are 24/7 they can get in linked with your bank account and they not child safety when I had musically it was child safety did not steal your at all . And also on tiktok I reported a lady in underwear and a bra and they this is safe/ NO THE F*CK IT IS NOT
"Questionable. Thanks to apples new feature where you can see what apps are asking access to when you download them I saw that TikTok is very suspicious, why would they need access to basically everything in your phone?Do not download this app unless you know what data they collect on you and where they share this data"
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. So before you tell them what kind of tiktoks you like theres like this thing about the terms and conditions, saying that they know about your data or something and they ask you if youre ok with that...   B**CH YOU THINK IM OKAY WITH THAT WORST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO AGREE YOU CANT EVEN OUT ON TOP OF THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN 1 TIKTOK ON MY FOR YOU PAGE ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER I am disappointed TikTok, and here I thought you were the best app ever, guess I was wrong Black Lives Matter (I feel like this is too much, is it too much?)"
Keep using tiktok. Tik tok is getting slandered by big corps dont be fooled by the media American companies are simply intimidated by TikTok and would rather ruin their reputation than compete fairly. Im all for data privacy and would rather delete Facebook etc over tiktok as these American companies have been taking our data for years and no one has cared? Great app I love it and wont be using any of the alternatives Im sure FB/Insta will attempt to introduce
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app takes you personal information like where you live, your phone number. Credit card numbers and many more DO NOT DOWNLOAD. And most important it takes your private videos and posts then all over the web for everyone to see. DO NOT DOWNLOAD DELETE TIK TOK AND GIVE IT A ONE STAR SO IT GETS TAKEN DOWN PROTECT YOUR KIDS"
"This is a data-stealing app DO NOT INSTALL. This app is a critical danger of your security, despite the fact that it seems to be fun and entertaining TikTok has sent loads and loads of data to the chinese government only download this app if you dare to be at great risk Id you do not believe me look it up on google, edge. Thanks for reading,Kterry"
Privacy violated. Feels like privacy violated so bad
"Security Warnings. I made up a experiment, I created 3 new accounts on 3 phones with new numbers and under new names. Everything was completely different, location tracking was off. I began just creating videos as usual and watching as usual, then I plugged my phone into my security software I have for my hosting services and discord bots. It was actively sending my email, phone number, name, all that information to a database. Then I managed to get do some magic to get into the data base in my code studio, it had lists on lists of information being sent to third party software and spam sites. I have already forwarded this to the police and government"
Stop using this app. dude this app takes your data secretly
DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR Definitely DELETE. I love tik tok I spend all my time watching it but I read and article that said that the creator of TikTok said if there was a app that took all your information and contacts and data well your using it and also said that Chinese people are taking our information and selling it do not trust this app (p.s)if i could rate zero would do
"Its pretty good but Im not entirely sure about safety. So I like TikTok better than YT shorts but I dont feel entirely safe with the privacy policy and data management and stuff like that. Its fun to use when watching ur fav stuff but Im still a bit uncertain/uncomfortable with online safety reasons and problems on the news with the Chinese government.I like the way it works and I like a lot of content creators but sometimes people get banned for no reasonBut overall its an ok app. If downloading I suggest you make ur account private and only use it to like, comment, etc.Have fun and stay safe yall "
STOP IT. JUST STOP STEALING PRIVATE INFORMATION
All your data is sent to the Chinese government. Research tiktok and how it sends your data to Chinese government
Great information platform. This app is entertaining and educational
Steals your info. Steals your information and sends it to China
Play this if you want the Chinese government stealing all you information. The Chinese government is using this app to steal the information of everyone who uses it
"TikTok is evil. Everybody knows that our phones know all of our information. But why dont we care? Tiktok watches all your data on other apps, even when you dont have tiktok open. This app is full of degeneracy and makes you numb to violence, language, and sexuality. It is crazy addictive and stimulating, and after just using it for a few weeks youre already going to be trapped. Its addictive. And the amount of dopamine will ruin your brain. For the love of God, dont get tiktok.In fact just remove all social media, its a genius scheme to take over your mind and make you weak"
Sharing personal data with third party. Not happy after reading terms and conditions
Its not healthy or safe. All of the people I know who are obsessed with TikTok r not mentally stable and have a shorter attention span bc of TikTok. Also it u literally look at the discretion it literally starts that it tracks everything you do on your phone. It invades privacy to an unsafe degree. Do not get this app
"DELETE TIKTOK NOWWW. TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and can store all your data from your phone to the china company including your phone number, payment information and many more. Plz delete TikTok for your own and everyone elses safety"
Tiktok. I give this a one star because the chines government owns this and is tracking ur location and what u buy and where u live and they probably have ur ip and they collect data/info from ur phone
Tiktok. It steals your data
Please don't ban it. Yes it steals ur info but so does every other app
They steal your info. They are literally stealing your information your ip you address God knows what there doing with it you should delete it
Security Issues. They steal your data and send it back to the CCP
DELETE THIS APP NOW. Tik Tok exists for the Chinese Government to spy on your internet and smartphone behaviour. Downloading this app will put you and your personal data at risk of being misused and against your knowledge at that. Please research this if you are not convinced. A few hours of entertainment is not worth the safety risks you put yourself at when using this app. They have sneaky features and very fine print to take your data and personal details. Please dont download this app
"Horrible. First of all, I cant even make an account.Its always lagging and I cant record anything. And I tried to take it off privacy and it does not let me. I am a full grown woman I am married with three kids and my name is Karen. I try to post fun memories of my kids to have them but it doesnt let me do anything. Last year my grandpa died and I wanted to share this sad moment with TikTok but it didnt let me. It deleted the video and it locked my account right away I dont know how this happened. When my mother died about eight years ago I was very disappointed I wanted to share it to social media the only platform that I could post it on  was Facebook. My uncle passed away two years ago it was a very sad moment I had recorded his death and his grave I prayed that I would be able to post it on a platform, I was very excited about this app but it turns out that its horrible. Nothing works on this dumb app. My son has no problems with this app but I cant figure out why I do hes 16 he has a full-time working job. He always spends at least five hours a day on TikTok. One day I asked him how he got everything working and he said just go to manage profile I did and nothing worked it seems like someone is hacking my account. I do not think this is a reason because I put of extremely strong password that is over eight characters long. My daughter that is 10 years old also has an app working fine. She has more than 3000 followers and everythings going great shes famous at her school and everyone loves her I am happy about this but I hate this app it doesnt work for me. My son that is 33 also has this app. He also has two kids but only one of them has TikTok. He has over 100 K followers. I tried posting a video of my dog that was having a seizure.I live in a penthouse that I pay for and it gets great Wi-Fi and great service but, Im not sure what is the problem but if this could get fixed Id really appreciate it so please reach out to me"
Use it wisely or it will use you. Love how we can find information that is not in the main stream media but at the same time be careful of the false information. Let your gut be the judge not your logic
Dont get. This app is owned by the Chinese government they can steal things such as ur phones data including everything about you and also using facial recognition
Its okay. I love it in my free time I use it a lot but I always get banned from posting even though I keep looking at the whole entire privacy policy. You need to step up your game TikTok
Malware. This app is a virus and it could steal you private information
This is terrible. People should not use this app. Its tracking your data and its highly addictive
Privacy. We cant even watch the videos without someone knowing now? We cant share it without notifying the creator. They are adding so many useless and unwanted features to the app and its turning into Snapchat
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This is a chinese app. Once download, you can be at risk from cyber attack. Your private information will be accessible. What you download, search over the internet, your pass codes, photos etc. Having this on your phone is a security risk Should be deleted from the store"
"100% great app. When i first started TikTok it was called musical.ly it was fun and enjoyable. For a while after TikTok was introduced again it was fun and enjoyable, the app has bought my confidence out a lot. There are so many different types or categories to choose from to watch. Everyones for you page is different it depends on your own interests. Since the lockdown has happened so many people have downloaded the app but unfortunately it is becoming a lot more toxic. I would only recommend this app if you have a stable mental health. Since the lockdown the bullying and hate has become more frequent. If the owner of the app was too actually act upon the bullying then the app would be fun and enjoyable again, right now its not. Another thing that needs to be sorted are the guidelines and what is classed as violations. Recently Ive had people post personal information about me and when I report the videos I get told  they dont violate the guidelines even through it clearly states anyone posting personal information about someone is a violation in the guidelines. Not just that but having videos removed for literally nothing. Yes I get them restored but if they are restored they obviously arent a violation so why are they removed in the first place. Another issue is contacting tiktok via email, whenever Ive emailed them about a problem Ive never had an actual response or if I have then it irrelevant to the situation Ive mentioned in the email"
"This app is spying on you for the Chinese Government. I found TikTok insecurely sending data like email addresses, microphone and camera data (when when just browsing the app) to separate Chinese servers. You should uninstall this app and never look back"
Im sorry but what. Ok so if you are downloading this on iPhone scroll down past the reviews and look at data linked to you it will say everything but your usage data that is not OK Tik tok fix it because that is an invasion of my privacy they can see my history and everything again that is not OK
"Owned By China Watch Out. Selling your data to a communist regime. If you like that, then go download this app "
They are spying on us. Don t download this they will get personal information about you
Trash trump . Im gonna give this app one stars bc we need to save TIK TOK Tik Tok stealing my personal information PLEASE HELP THEY STEALL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT MY CONSENT 
"Tik Tok is aimed at exploiting your privacy and stealing your personal data. Although most apps will sell off your data to third parties such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. They dont exploit their users anywhere near as much as Tik Tok. From the moment you install the app they create a folder on your device where they make permanent connections and store all your information which is nearly impossible to reverse. No app would need such an aggressive approach to function legitimately. They aim to manipulate their users by filtering content that they view. Anonymous reverse engineered the app and found out more very concerning things so please view his tweet to learn more for yourself. So Im pretty glad governments are waking up to ban this app"
Bad app bad privacy bad owners. Title says it all
Waste of time. Stay away and spend time with your loved ones. Complete waste of time and who knows what they are doing with our data. I don&#39;t trust this app
TikTok. Its a very good app and would recommend. I get to follow my friends and their friends and get to see what everyone is up to The app has some privacy issues but I havent experienced it myself
Im a lil worried. I love tiktok and I think its fun but Ive heard a lot of stuff that says they steal your data and use it to make a copy of your phone but idk whats goin on
Spy warning. Chinese government steals information from your phone with this app
Considered as spy on personal info by some countries. Deleting as many countries considered this app spying on personal data and could be misuse
"Stealing privacy. This app is located in china.Please delete this app, they are stealing your private information and hack into your phone.They will know your passwords, emails and etc"
Disgusting. This app is so disgusting.This app can steal your personal information and Your phone will run  out of charge fast. There is no such a content in this app that you can be influenced. Just dont be fool and download this app. It should be ban all over the world
Dk. Its a great app but if someone reports your account for even the silliest reason your account gets deleted. And also accounts if as big as 20 mil can easily get hacked and deleted which is a risk. I had 1k followers which I spent ages getting tik tok went and deleted my acc for spam
Garbage. Stealing personal data
Why??. So I actually got rid of the app for this reason but apparently tiktok was taking your information and your contact lists all that and putting it in a database
U creeps. Hi Ive heard that ur app has been taking all my database from when Im on TikTok and also not on it so that means that u know all my contacts all my history on safari and everything I do on my phone and even while my phone is of it still records me while Im on the app so u creeps probably watch me sleep Im not using ur app and informing others about this unless you make a bargain so if u dont do this I will get the police into this text me yes if you agree to my bargain because you probably know my number and where I live so I might move house actually I will so u no longer will know my address so stop looking through others phones or I will report u to the police
"1 problem with TikTok. I absolutely love TikTok its like the only app I really use or my go to app I do use CapCut a Snapchat to but I just love TikTok. Ive had TikTok for a about 3 years now and its great but, TikToks new privacy update is ridiculous like just because Im not 16 I cant dm my friends and Im barely getting Any followers or likes now. I really hope you understand that. I also hope that this update doesnt stay for long either I really dont mean to be rude just please get rid of the new privacy update. Other than that I love TikTok and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your evening/day/night"
"Perfecto. I think its a wonderful app, I was wondering if you could go live without data if TikTok gets banned Im killing myself"
"DELETE. DELETE THE APP, ITS RUN BY A CHINESE GOVERMENT THAT STEALS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY"
Ummmmm. This app is controlled by the Chinese so Chinese can steal your data so.I tell you to delete yes appIf you want to hear more information go on YouTube and write is TikTok getting banned
"This app is full of inappropriate content. My friends and I joined this app and since that day, they have changed. We have been exposed to inappropriate content on the daily via this app. I have uninstalled this app but they havent because they are hooked. TikTok should do a better job of taking down content and stop underaged people on it. Some of my friends siblings under 13 are on this app. I am disappointed The company also tracks you with out your permission. Do not download"
"Tiktok need to improve security of its users. I am very glad with Tiktok platform and give it 5 stars Just improve security features please, the others should not be allowed to use my picture and name to creat their fake profiles In this digital age personal safety is everything and Tiktok need to adopt security systems like Insta etc Regards"
"Spies on you 24/7. This app not only tracks you while on the app, but it also tracks you when you&#39;re NOT on the app. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re under the age of 18 or not, your personal data isn&#39;t safe"
This app should be taken down. First of all there is a lot of copy righted music and second this app is making you tell them your personal information and 3 this app is full of weird people
Your app is trash. This app is a good waste of your time and a horrible way to use your life The app goes through all your posts and personal information  and then when they have got everything they delete your account just like thatNever get this app it is basically you downloading a virus on you device
Great App. Best source of information Out there. Keep it up
Data at risk. I suggest avoid this app
"WARNING . DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. THIS APP CAN SEND YOUR PERSONAL INFO TO THE CCP. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP, AS YOUR DATA, SOMETIMES EVEN FROM OTHER APPS CAN BE SEEN BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY.UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR DATA SEEN BY THE CCP, DO NOT EVEN GO NEAR THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON.(also its a cringe app)"
Stop watching me. Tiktok why are you consuming so much data from our devices? And why are you using our cameras to spy on us? Twitter and other social medias do not consume this much data. Please respect others privacy and stop watching/ spying on us thru our cameras And stop posting peoples drafts. You are really fucking creepy tiktok like we didnt post our drafts for a reason so please stop spying thru our cameras and posting our drafts and stop consuming soooo much data from us
"Good but dangerous. This afternoon I had people telling me that my account was on google even though I put my account on private so I searched my user name and my location and all my other personal information was on google for the whole world to see. So I hope you dont download this app if you are under 12 because people you dont even know can see you because a pedi file followed my sister and she accepted the follow request then she kept getting random phone calls that she actually answered saying where do you live, what do you do for a living, where are you right now she told him where we live then he came to our house knocked on our door and asked for my sister even though he looked he was in his 60s but we definitely knew he was an adult strait away but now hes been arrested and were all happy and safe. Make sure you keep yourself save online especially. Thank you for reading this hope you have a great day "
"TikTok may spy on you secretly, using the clipboard. Ive seen inappropriate things on this app, the reports dont even bother, and this app has a lot of racist, homophobic, people on this app"
Entertaining the sleepy when its needed. A awesome platform to spread everything and anything within its safety policy and data protection well done TikTok For safeguarding users and having a strict policy
"Hate this app. Steals your info and people that dont break the community guidelines get their accounts banned but when other people post  worse things they dont get banned, get a life because your not doing anything about this. So dont download if you want to be safe, please :("
Steals your data and violates your privacy. It has been proven that this app listens to you with your microphone and takes your MAC address and has access to your clipboard. DELETE THIS APP NOW
Controlled by Chinese Dictatorship?. Read up first very careful to find out who gets to know the most private data about yourself before embedding this into your phone
Amazing. I really enjoy using TikTok. Its really fun to create videos and post them. Privacy settings aren&#39;t great but i managed to get a private account. 5 stars
Delete app. Delete this if you dont want to get hacked and all of your personal information stolen
Steals your clipboard data. Sooooo......iOS 14 has revealed TikTok steals your clipboard data and that includes your credit info and password manager infoSTOP USING IT
"My profile was hacked and no one helped. So I love this app. But I noticed that I was getting notifications on comments that I never made on videos whose language I dont understand. I reported the profile on which it was occurring, and discovered that the phone number associated with my profile was no longer mine. I reported that. I cannot delete my profile without SMS notifications and its really scary to know that someone could be out there making harmful comments in my name. Tiktok did nothing to assist me"
"Unsafe. TikTok is a pretty cool app but the fact that I have no idea about the safety of my private information and my device made me delete this app. If it sorts out its safety issues, Ill consider re-downloading it. Its also so addictive and its unhealthy how much time some spend on the app"
Unsafe stealing privacy. Not good for your safety as per your privacy concern.Please avoid as much as you can .Your choice your safetyThink about it.Thanks
useless. harm your phone and copy data
"Sell your soul for free. Tiktok is the epitome of modern day censorship which should be no surprise considering it is ran by a Chinese communist backed parent company. Your data is fully available to the Chinese government and while few have any data that is useful as far as espionage or military data, the ability to hone in on the he American market is substantial. Especially with Biden being such a week leader of foreign policy, now more than every the communist, state run, of China has all the data it could hope for in the economic war of exports all countries face"
TikTok. Its a nice app but now its just getting too toxic and crazy  but its helping me in quarantine so But the biggest problem is TikTok just steals your data and information and sells it in China so yall be safe
"DELETE NOW. There are videos on YouTube about why you should delete TikTok It can steal your information, delete now please. This app is also really toxic and NOT for kids, it was a mistake for me to download this app"
Data collection farm. Its unsafe. A data collection app masquerading as a social platform. I dont trust it
"problems. the app sends information back to china, a place that collects it and uses it for massive human rights violations and genocide. there is no protection mechanism for us, non chinese users"
"its ok. even though the app can be VERY racist as well as being inappropriate it is still a fun app to make videos with friends and family I recommended getting tiktok just for fun the name funny videos not to be racist or being hate upon anyone that is in the app. Some others got tiktok when it was called musically when it was musically it was way more family friendly even though I am a 10 year Old girl writing this I still believe that tiktok is a fun app but it has some scary stuff about it like this... if u didnt know tiktok was made by the Chinese/Japanese either one of those well lets Cary on, so when u sign onto TikTok it steals all info from the device your using it takes your search history all the stuff u search on YouTube and ad well as TikTok and have I ever wondered why there is a for you page? well I can kind of tell is called the for u page but the reason is called that is bc its TAKING everything your searching so they know what u watch Thats why is called the for u page its a page for recommended videos. as well as taking all the pictures on up ur phone and taking all thats personal info, and selling it to the CHINESE  GOVERNMENT and even if u dont put your phone number to sign up it will still get your phone number bc it looks through your phone its probably watching this right now and another creepy thing if your not even recording and your on the tiktok app it will start AUTOMATICALLY RECORDING you and if your about to record and your on the camera to record a tiktok it will also record that, it also steals your drafts people that work for the government are NOT aloud to have it because it steals to much info I hope u read this all i know its a lot but.... THIS NEEDS TO BE HEARD"

THIS NEEDS TO BE HEARD"
"Deleted and not looking back. There is three things that made me delete this app. I was seeing a lot of cp (child pornography) as peoples profile pictures and posts, I saw a mans penis on my for you page using a trending filter and hashtag, (this next part will contain talk of sh (self harm)) there was a video of a girl with people around her and she was harming herself quite bad, people were reposting it and yet again using it as their profile picture. Before you say I hated tiktok from the start or Im old thats why I am leaving it a bad review well no in fact I am a young teen and I didnt want to see these things at all but I didnt choice.. I had a account and Id post quite often, I loved tiktok but I cannot support this app if they let this happen. Ive tried to report these things and many other posts that they let stay on their app such as adult nudity on a childs app, drug use, sh, homophobia and transphobia but my reports dont do anything, tiktok doesnt care so after seeing said three things I deleted all my accounts and the app its self. I will only go back if this can get settled and removed off the app or if this app gets sold to another company"
"Community guidelines. My 12 year old daughter has downloaded this app, she has been hacked, and body shamed Nobody did anything about this. She is very upset. Sort youre community guidelines out because that is not right"
"Taking my info?. Tik tok, I heard that you guys are taking information from peoples videos before they even hit next ... This is making me wonder if I should delete the app or keep it and hide my face? .. This is very concerning and you guys should do something about it. I dont want kids getting stolen or you guys taking their info. Why? Fix this"
Dodgy app that deletes your account. Permanently Bans your account for no reason I wasnt even using the app for months and you lose everything with no reason why. The reason is  they are yet another dodgy Chinese company harvesting everyones personal info dont use this app it should be banned from the App Store
"Racist, ableist, fatphobic, the list goes on. This is not an app that cares about its creators or takes any moral standing at all, The platform itself takes down or hides videos from black creators, and other creators it doesnt consider part of its brand. Tiktok censors discussion and awareness around critical issues - hashtags related to the murder of Georgie Floyd and the black lives matter movement were briefly blocked, and a user criticising the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China was blocked. This is unacceptable.There has also been evidence of tiktok secretly harvesting private data. Basically, there seems to me few reasons why one would want to download this app. Protect yourself and others Dont download tiktok"
"Get this app if you want the chinese government spying on you. If you want your data to be sold off get this app Great way to throw tour privacy out the window, and also dont forget the 12 year old girls dancing sexually, tik tok wouldnt be the same without that"
This is not a good app. this app corrupted my cousin it also steels your information and sell it to companys in china if u do not want your information stolen i recommend you to do not download this app you will be robed and it will take your pay pal i tried on a back up email and it was stolen :( DELETE IT NOW
"Mobile Data. Whilst i was out yesterday, i was using my data and decided to go on tiktok. The app said there was no internet however my mobile data was fine for other apps and my friends app was working fine with data"
"Entertaining but MASSIVE problem. As most of you may know, TikTok is a large app with millions of people on it. However, what most people that use TikTok dont know, is that their information is being sold to people. They gather your information and sell it. They have, so far, gathered MILLIONS of personal information from unsuspecting adults, and, CHILDREN. I use this app daily and it keeps me entertained, HOWEVER, this needs to stop. If TikTok wants their app to stop getting hate, they need to up their game. Sooner other than LATER. I hope they read this as what theyre doing is COMPLETELY unacceptable"
Extreme Control on Censorship and Privacy Issues. TikTok has extreme control on censorship and privacy issues. Until they stop censoring free thoughts and speech I do not recommend this app
Videos deleted privacy guidelines. Mi videos keep getting deleted saying privacy Guidelines and I havent broken the privacy guidance in any ways and my videos are appropriate  am only 7 days on tiktok and am getting this already someone help
Keep your data safe and dont download. This app is nothing but a data surveillance app for the Chinese Communist Party. Do your research and search the notes on the reverse engineering that has been carried out on this app and youll soon see nothing on your phone is safe. DELETE TIK TOK
Tiktok. I love it I can express myself I would rate this for  confidence make sure your checking that your notification are private over wise strangers can see your content be careful
"Good platform with loads content. Its a good platform for tons of short video content that boast massive interest and following, can be addictive and distracting. However some who concern about the advocacy of privacy biggest, ByteDance takes tons of data. If you dont mind handing over data to the Chinese government. As TikTok is registered as Chinese business"
KEEP GETTING STOLEN BY THE CHINESE. TikTok is a Chinese app who WILL look into your phone for your personal informations
New update invades privacy. I like to see nice TikTok accounts from my fyp and sometimes I end up visiting. But I kinda dont wanna them to know I peeked through their account. I do give likes on videos when I peek. And one tiktoker posted screenshots of who visited to that account. I was not there but the insult was real on that video. I felt bad for those who were there. Ive been avoiding profile visiting lately:(
"Help me contact TikTok. This was my favourite app of all time been on here since it was musically but very distressed at the moment as TikTok deleted my account for no reason so I appealed it they said they was sorry n restored my content I was over the moon n then the next day they deleted it again n I dont know why I hadnt posted anything new as I wasnt allowed I was shadow banned, I need help reaching out to the company this isnt right or fair I am someone who suffers from Asd n pda for those who dont know thats on the autistic spectrum n I dont know how to handle this please do something about this TikTok My account had just started to get the clout it needed n theyre loads of drafts n videos on there that mean a lot to me for personal reason (deceased pets n incarcerated family) n arent saved to my phone"
"2 Part Review - Please Read. Ive been using Tiktok for some time now, and I have to say I dont know if my account was hacked or what, but I cant see my followers anymore, and I am extremely disappointed  PS. If you guys think this service is good for your mental health, its not. It ruined me, and I lost a friend on here because of a silly mistake I made. I wont be back on this platform anytime soon. - Part 1Part 2 - Ive deleted my videos by accident, because I didnt know that the link that Tiktok sent me was a scam, and now when I try to retrieve said videos, its a very hard and complicated process to get my videos back. Please figure out a way for the user to be able to retrieve their videos back if they want them back. Also, too many users under the age of 18 are on Tiktok, I really think these kids that are on Tiktok should wait until theyre 18 before they start using the service, but hey thats just my opinion. I highly doubt anyone at Tiktok will make these changes"
"Warning. This app is one not to download. Every draft, every TikTok you post are saved in  the Chinese governments data. They store so they can use it against you later on. I do not suggest having an account but just roaming on it. If you see this well its going to get deleted watch"
Trash. Why would you download it it sells your info to the Chinese government no thank you
"Tic tok changed. Takes so long to download has some inappropriate stuff, I find that there stealing information and people are getting too comfortable in the app"
"The tik of tok. Collection of personal data* for adds, selling data, etc for shared servers. Is a no. I like the news"
Tiktok is addicting and is just china spyware. Tiktok openly admitted that their app collects data on people and sends it to the Chinese government. dont download it
Please read this TIKTOK. It is a great app with lots of entertainment included but may be better if you had more control of privacy and could make it more appropriate in some ways Thanks for your time
"Tiktok Tiktok. Sell your life away & data to china for free; opinions are like crap, everybodys got one and they all stink, but as far as Im concerned mine is that  uninteresting repetitive cesspool currently downloadable on the appstore; and have fun researching where their data goes"
"Delete this app unless you want your personal info shared. Ever since I saw this app as a continuation of musically I could just see bad news from a mile away and well what do you know this app takes your data and gives this to the Chinese government, which can be accessed at anytime by any official apart of it. Not to mention how half of the people of this app are young and vulnerable and are sometimes encouraged by other users to wear little clothing in them. Delete this app and get the bastards who made the app in prison"
"racist, ableist & privacy invaders. TikTok has blocked mentions of Black Lives Matter &amp; George Floyd from their platform. They ban disabled users just for existing. This app is disgusting &amp; has no care for privacy. Your data is not secure with this app"
"Um. apparently this app is getting banned or something, is this true? please respond and also, are u guys stealing private information?or is it just rumours?"
"I had to delete it. Apparently if you have tiktok which is made near China there stealing your information so I think you should put tiktok down it is rubbish and I dont like the fact that your stealing out information, yes yes. I only want it to be a short video app its better that wayWow a lot of writing hope you put this review up"
"The best way to get your data stolen. Tiktok is either your favorite or least favorite way to get your data stolen by china. Personally, its my favorite Massive handful of cringe but once you use the app enough you should get great videos recommended to you"
App steal private information without you knowing. Stupid app steal information without you knowing whatsoever stupid blergh
Love it but. I honestly love tiktok but Ive deleted it since theres rumours going around saying &#34;it steals your data and info&#34; idk if this is true but I really regret it and now I cant get my account back and Im scared to put in info or whatever can someone tell me if this is true or if its fake please because my account has 11.6K followers and I feel like Ive just wasted it
"Its actual spyware. The app has a long history of using bugs to hack the users phone to extract data. It used a bug with the apple copy and paste functionality to capture users passwords, account numbers and other sensitive information. Anything you copied or pasted on any apple device that was liked to your apple account they captured. Delete this spyware. So if you had TikTok on your phone and were copying sensitive information on your desktop then TikTok has it"
Please delete tiktok. Apparently there is something going on where the Chinese government is using tiktok to hack peoples data and personal information. Please delete tiktok now for your own safety
Info. Yeah tiktok for a while has been selling ur info to the Chinese government
"There is privacy issues. As many already mentioned, there are some privacy issues for this app"
"Bad app. Tik Tok is  tracking all your personal data and information, you should delete the app immediately"
"Hacked. I have absolutely loved TikTok for the past few years, it has helped me so much to express myself. Recently though, my private account got permanently banned for no reason. The message had seemed like it was a scam, because it stated, You can also download your data I thought that this would be a big problem, since my account most likely got hacked, but I guess not. I have emailed, sent private messages, and sent feedback MULTIPLE times. *Keep in mind, this happened 4-5 days ago* I am extremely disappointed in TikTok and their help center at the moment. I seriously expected better"
Privacy invasion. Tik tok out of nowhere locked my account and said that if Im over thirteen I can send them my GOVERNMENT ID to them and I can have my account back. Please no thanks I deleted my acc
. If you want your data sold use it
Spying. They spy on me I hate this app report it they were literally spying a green dot and it said face time TikTok
"Spying?. To those people saying Tik tok steals your information, well think about Apple, google, etc. I dont personally like tik tok, in fact I dont even have the app"
"Look at TikToks privacy policy. Hello please dont delete this tik tok but you openly state to being able to see our search history our location and more, for reasons Im not talking about"
"People are dumb. TikTok isnt getting banned It was fake runors to spread hate to Donald trump, the App Store is protective and make sure your stuff isnt leaked, Facebook collects more data than this"
"READ THIS. Tiktok is racist, they delete any videos with black people in and also collect information about you on the daily. If you download this app you&#39;re literally letting them collect information about everything you do. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, it also has trash content such as underage twerking girls"
Not even letting me in. When I got tiktok I tired to sigh up and I am at the age it says Its not working...then I looked at the privacy and it is kind of scary they collect a lot of your information plus there is a lot of bad people on here...It is a big let down please fix your app and privacy
Tik tok wants ur information. Its so TOXIC Whoever created tikTok they look at ur face THROUGH THE APP AND SCAMM You They use ur information and scamm u trust me it happend
"The tik of tok. Collection of personal data* for adds, selling data, etc for shared servers"
"Recommend. Its a great app for when your bored, but sometimes it freezes and then I have to uninstall and its very annoying. And I dont know what to say about privacy concerns surrounding Tiktok, Im simply rating it because its a good app I reccomend"
Tictok. Me and my friends do enjoy watching tictok but the problem is that the government can track down your information from this app if you dont believe me Search it up also tictok is rude mean and is very rude to people that are gay lesbian bisexual transgender and on  
Toxic. This app is just toxic if you download it then make ur account PRIVATE
So Bad. TikTok is super bad for you tracksall your information and the people who make it are liars I definitely would not recommend getting this app
"Idk . Its fine yeah. But i heard a bunch of rumors about how tiktok tracks you and stuff, and it got me super freaked out. I don&#39;t know if its true or not, but i suggest to keep it safe and not download it But in total, its a pretty cool app. Some of the videos are kind of weird and some are worse Its super fun making videos and all. Ganging followers is also fun, but really, to me safety is more important. For the app i would rate 3 and a half but with the privacy matters i would say 1 or 2. If you want to keep safe, just incase... Dont download this app."
"Scams / fraud. How many times I have seen fraud and scams where people upload stuff where you simply click a link and your info can be pinched fake sites set up by these accounts to steal credit card info etc, you report them to TikTok using their report system and they brush it off saying its ok"
Best app if u want to sell your privacy. Tiktok is a giant malware in the name of social networking. For more information google it. Safer alternative for this Virus app is Triller
"New privacy policy is really dumb. This new privacy is very stupid the app is literally made for teenagers and now teenagers cant fully use the app, if someone doesnt like the interactions there getting then they should turn them off themselves it shouldnt be forced upon everyone"
Great. So I had tiktok and my parents made me delete it because they dont want people finding about my identity or like getting private info I had a private account and everything but can you try and make it a little safer
"Personal. Due to personal reasons and rumours about this app &amp; the owners, I will be deleting it and giving them one star"
Scamm. Its a scamm according to Americans officials it collects all your phone data and submits to the chinese government officials which is a somehow cyber crime you should bann this app .. Immediately
Bad. When I get in it it wants my data
Awful app. It sucks and they take all your personal info
"Bad service. I really enjoy this app. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because they updated the app to where the privacy settings are strict if youre under the age of 16, and I accidentally put my birthday in wrong and they wont let me change it. I contacted them about it and they did answer, but its been three weeks and they still never fixed it. TikTok if youre reading this, please help me out"
Dodgy. The app is amazing but my only concern is why it collect so much of your data than other apps such a Instagram
"Data theft Chinese server. This could be one of the app china can use anytime to get your biometric information, its  a threat to our great nation"
"i deleted it to save my data. my account was deleted and i lost hundreds of drafts and saved videos and im sick of seeing the same people doing the same thing every post, too addictive and waste of time really data consuming"
CAN YOUR APP  JUST DIE YOUR APP IS SO CRINGE. YOU GET YOUR DATA STOLEN
"Be careful. Amazing but one problemOn tiktok u can get badly affected by haters and scammers some peeps can even find out personal information, so just be careful ok, thanks other than that great app"
TikTok. I personally think you should not download TikTok because they are sending your information to China. They are basically spying on you
Wrongful bans/suspensions/ theft of data and content. I am a creator. I have 17k followed and I help foster youth and use the plate form to educate and run my charity. Many many times tiktok has wrongfully banned me or removed content. Then had to restore bc there was nothing wrong with my content or account. The system works so poorly. I have many many screenshoot of the many many times they apologized and restored my account. Its disgusting the work someone puts in to make awareness and educate just so the robots that run this app can screw up all the time. All the time. Everytime. My handle is/was @leeleeclark tiktok Im asking you to restore my account again. Ive submitted tickets and emails. Next is lawsuit for freedom of speech and theft of data. You refused me ability to appeal. You always do. The second you suspend my account it says appeal deadline passed? In seconds? Minutes? What?
Steals information. do NOT under any circumstances make an account if you already have an account delete it now
Tiktok is horrible. Tiktok is cringe and funny but now it can take your personal information so now its garbage
Stop watching us. STOP SENDING YOUR INFO TO CHINESE GOV BYTE FENCE WE WANT PRIVACY
"Dont download. Theyre taking your info, and probably selling it for a lot of money. On top of that, the community is toxic, and its overall very dangerous for your mental health as well"
"Should be banned. This app is one of the worst app to have ever exist, it ruins everything, mostly the songs, them kids be ruining all of hem. But also, privacy, oh this is bad, yall should check the app privacy section of the apple store page of this app. There is like zero privacy, they sell all of your data to third party, they have all of your info, and it get worse when you realize it&#39;s own by some chinese company. It&#39;s very dangerous, this app is like 99% spyware and 1% of people doing toxic stuff"
Why does tiktok need my payment info. I just deleted the app and tried to re-download it to see if I can now go live on TickTock and it keeps saying that it needs my payment information to be updated and it keeps saying payment information failed so now I have no access to TikTok on my phone
"Steals Data And Doesnt Care About The Community. They have honestly ruined tiktok for many reasons and one of them being that they keep deleting my favourite creators content for no reason and when i put ,,not interested on a video in my fyp it keeps coming up for no reason, i dont wanna see any fan pages and political videos but they seem that its a good idea to put them up on peoples fyp, its honestly annoying"
PROFILE VIEWS INVADE PRIVACY. Nobody wants their inbox to be the first thing they see. I dont even see half of my notifications now because its on a completely separate page. Give us a choice to have it that way or not. I have 99+ messages because I dont care about my inbox but you put it as the foremost part of your dashboard now. We send each other tiktoks through imessages and other apps. NOT THRU TIKTOK. And now we have PROFILE VIEWS???? What the heck is that? Its literally the worst idea youve ever had as a company. Explain why thats a good idea to let people see who lurks you? Its so stupid
"Some people presents very useful contents. The contents that bring awareness on our daily living style, factual proof of research, dark and good side of some cause - effects & some controversy contents makes tiktok 5 star rated but some contents are like advertisement of their personal dirty sense. Both ways, its useful like a short news clips"
No privacy. To busy monitoring my personal dms thinking in sending Unappropriate messages when Im not
What ? Please read. Something has been going on with people saying TikTok is saving and scannig peoples faces and look at stuff in your drafts  that you havent deleted and getting all your personal info I am freaking out and they are sending it to China ( so be carefull )also its not a bad app so yeah
"bad. tiktok is racist and they keep posts up that are inappropriate and disgusting. but when there is a video about BLM or LGBTQ+ they take it down. i dont recommend they also take your personal information they can see your search history, your pictures, messages, contacts and other personal information. dont get tiktok for your safety"
"Data leak. Dont use it, it copy the contacts list and i found my contact list being shared to fraud companies"
Dude. I downloaded it. Had a security app on my phone. App said phone is at risk. Ignored it. Email got hacked. So did phone number. Deleted tik Tok because my brother said it tracks your device information. App said phone was safe. Boom
DO NOT GET RID OF . I love this app not like Im on it 24 7 but if the rumours are true and people with less then 1000 followers will have to start over pls tell me so I can delete the app.#1 : people use this app to show of adds and brands even to stay well in this tough time and asks for donations for poor kids and families.#2 : there is more 5 star ratings then 1 star ratings this proves that the app well loved and helps inspire others #3 rating by (Mickey_p)OMG first of all TikTok is amazing like with Facebook where your one post goes viral instead with TikTok you can go viral as a person I have so so much fun on TikTok its incredible. TikTok gives you options to change your voice and the way you look with cool effects. #4 you can have private account were only you and the people you follow can see its good for privacy and safety there is also options to turn off comments this makes it so haters cant put you down .blocking and reporting also helps (Lara Attenborough) (TikTok chicken nuggets 362 and guess_who5553)
"Inappropriate. I know that most of the reviews for this app are good but Im going to be completely honest. The reason why people like this app is because you can make funny videos with cool effects. They also say that its addicting and a great way to kill time. Whilst this all this is true, there is a cost that comes with it. For one, this app steals so much user data. This may not seem like a big thing on paper but in real life it is. TikTok can see what you do, what you post, sell that data and therefore sell you ads and recommendations. This is cruel I dont want my data sold and stored onto their servers I dont want to be spied on Number two, this app has so many inappropriate ads. People argue that other social media apps are the same but that is a weak argument. You only see inappropriateness on other platforms if you go looking for it. However, with this app, the second you open it you see something inappropriate. I have no idea why this app is so popular but it does deserve this fame Just because something is popular doesnt mean that it is good Please dont download it or be prepared to get your data stolen and be prepared to see inappropriate ads Shame on this app It doesnt deserve to be on the App Store"
TikTok is awesome. I have never been a big fan of social media and everybody posting their thoughts online. But I do like the fact that this is strictly video because that is all I have liked social media for is posting video content of either your day today or your creative edited videos. Way to go TickTock on a platform that only allows video content. With commenting of course. Only thing I would ask to change is that the data isnt stored on your device because TikTok takes up the most of my phones memory.Other than that five stars by far
Hi. Well I think tiktok is bad because you dont know if Addison Rae could be a 50 year old man and they can get your private information and they can hack into your account even if its private and can you pls ask the government t9 band it cause its not safe
Takes ur Private info. Ya
"Spyware and unhealthy influence. It has all your data and its influencers are most of the time, as dumb as a rock. Just get reddit instead"
STOP. They steal private data from you Dont download
Boycott Chinese apps and products. This app uses personal information as well as camera access avoid using this much 
"Do not download this app. It is run by a Chinese company. They are currently in a lawsuit about stealing childrens information. If you are okay with giving your information to the Chinese government, go ahead and download this app. Keep in mind that they can and probably will sell your data. Stay safe fellow AppStore users"
"Hacking? . I no longer have TikTok because of the hacking. If you have had TikTok before or have TikTok you would know that you can make drafts, but what you most likely didnt know is that they are being saved by hackers, they also go through your photos. Now because of an update they have you cant enjoy the content without creating an account which you need either your phone number or email for (If you were wondering)"
"Love it but. I love this app. You can meet so many people, explore, all round amazing. But, this is the second time ive been banned, and the second time without warning or reason. Would appreciate if we could get warnings or account be suspended before being permanently banned. Drafts, favourites, followers. All completely gone. Many memories, gone extinct. Heartbreaking. I didnt get the chance to download my data and when it came up, it was for my new account. So it it would be nice if we could download the data after weve been banned as some dont get the chance to"
"Think twice before downloading. Lack of transparency. Need to know more about what is done with data taken from users (especially children). Currently, this data is taken without the consent of children, or their parents.  Watch the ABC four corners episode for more information"
It tracks you. Scroll down and it will have a privacy thing which tracks your data and track you to
GREAT APP. The only issue that I found is that other users are stealing other user's content and theg are advertising their merch which is a way to get people Credit/Debit card info and with no way to cancel their payment TIKTOK PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE Help creators to protect their own videos
exposing privacy. first of all tiktok is an amazing addictive app. but recently peoples drafts have been released which is NOT ok also the likes do not work no matter what i hope this app gets banned
If ur reading this right now then get this app now. This app is amazing and so easy to use the privacy features are extremely helpful if u have a kid And also you self. This app is very fun and some people on here are extremely creative 
"I love TikTok. When we were in Covid lockdown I downloaded the app. Its been a major source of fun and entertainment for me ever since. My faves are AlongCameAbby, Wafffler69, & Useless_Farm but there are dozens of sweet and adorable videos. You can really watch clips about anything and everything - makeup, food, Harry Styles, sports, and so on. I rarely see things I find offensive or inappropriate. I love it; HOWEVER, even though I have my privacy settings set on all apps in every way possible, TT is still observing me and it triggers clips based on what it finds. That wont stop me from using it but I dont like that"
Think about this. Millions and millions of dollars are invested into making an app like Tik Tok. Then you download it for free. The app is free to use...How is that possible when millions are spent? Its because YOU are the product.They Sell YOUR information And this app is worse than your typical Snapchat app. It was caught copying your clip board info without even asking permission. What else is it doing? Theres a reason its being shutdown in North America Open your eyes
"dont steal my data. Ummm, I think some Chinese data base is collecting all of my personal info"
"Ups and Downs. This app is fun and is a great concept of vine and music.lly (sorry if I spelt it wrong) but it also takes your information and if you make a private account, TikTok can still see your videos. Sometimes you can get banned for no reason and no warning. And the same with videos too. If you do download this app, dont give any personal information out"
DANGEROUS APP. Not only is the app filled with cringy teenagers the fact that it is owned by a Chinese company that collects all your information such as email passwords IP address etc this information can be leaked and the Chinese government is using it to spy on anyone they please. STAY AWAY FROM TIKTOK
Do not download case your data get stolen. If you didnt know tik tok got banned in America and If you downloaded it your data will be solled and uninstall
Really good app but. They make it look to easy to go viral and its too easy to hack people like people could just guess passwords and why dosent it tell you when someone tried to login your account or when you try too many times you get locked for 1m then 5m and so on but its good because there are a lot of videos but one issue I have here is that people get doxxed/ get personal information and leak it on the Internet and another issue is that it never gives me updates because I updated my TikTok and its still wont give me any updates like the 5m videos and I like it cause its a good app And a bunch of videos but the most bad issue I have here is the Fyp cause I think it needs to say are you sure or other warnings before you click it
"Safety is an issue. As a minor on the social media app, TikTok, Ive been through a lot. Ive had old men follow me as well as people harass me over the age of 18. Keep in mind that I am a minor. I report things like this to TikTok and they say theres nothing wrong with this and its not violating guidelines. Ive also been harassed by other teens. Yes, I have used the block feature, but that doesnt stop everyone, as you can always make other accounts. People comment on my posts, hurtful things, resulting in cyber bullying. TikTok refuses to help me when I message them about it, resulting in an unsettling feeling for myself. Ive provided proof to this happening and TikTok still says that I shouldnt worry. TikTok strives to be a safe app for teens who wanna try to rise to fame, when in realty, its not as safe as they make it sound. As a teenager with 1.4k followers on my @your_local_bi_equestrian account, I do not feel safe on the app. I also know about the privacy feature, where you can have a private acc. I dont feel that makes me safe either way, as you still dont know who everyone is. Please consider safety before you download this app"
Review. Not impressimpressed with the new policy on bullying that my account is on privacy so you let me get doxxed and thats not legal do better tiktok cus I lost my job because u let the doxxing video stay up and all the hate videos should be taken down I was only doing a oc video very disappointed in this
"Huge TikTok Fan. It took me years to understand why everyone wanted me to download Tiktok. After trying it out , Im now addicted to it . I love the fun times , laughs , battles , videos , and meeting new people .  My two concerns are , how fast you can get banned and most often it was not even what they said you did . That should be monitored more unfortunately. Also, the fake accounts and privacy settings should be checked into . Too many people make another account up after being banned just to continue harassing innocent people . The privacy settings should allow you to approve who enters your live. But all in all, its a fun app"
"My Privacy. Great app, I just wish I can let anybody comment on my videos"
Its ok but it it sells your data. Yep it sells your data
"TikTok for 50+ Adults. This platform received negative peer reviewed research in the past surrounding well-being. I signed up and began to watch content. While there are always going to be cynics, negative Nancys and people just out to hurt others, there are great benefits to this platform. Many users have openly thanked and created content surrounding how this platform improved their quality of life, expanded their social identity reach to connect with similar users etc. Aside from some questionable characters and trolls, I found the platform to be relevant and enjoyable. Of course as a data girl and innovator I have tons of recommended improvements. However for right now Im still learning comment and follow etiquette before I attempt to take on content creation. Keep up the good work"
"IRRESPONSIBLE APP. I downloaded this app when it was still musical.ly, I posted many videos and I even kept the app when I found out they were selling the personal information they found out about us. I enjoyed using tiktok and posted a video almost everyday and managed to get almost 3 thousand followers from it However, apart from this being a very enjoyable app I wake up one morning to see that my account @rosa.thompsony has been banned, I then submit an appeal and get it back, which was good however it got banned again and I here is no appeal button and even after sending about 20 emails saying that they wrongfully banned my account, and I even provided proof that I am of age for the app (13+) and I still had no reply. I am really upset about this and l really thinly that everyone knows that tiktok WILL NOT help you if anything ever goes wrong Da"
"Dont get Tiktok. It is addicting, a scam, and it takes all your information. Its a bad app that made me get mental health issues"
STOP TRACKING LOCATION. THIS APP TRACKS YOUR LOCATION AND IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME GO AND CHECK THE PRIVACY POLICY
Dumb. The dances that people do on here have got to be the stupidest things ever dont download unless you want to be bombarded with cringey videos on your for you page. Not to mention TikToks privacy guidelines are horrible they have access to so much of your information. Do yourself a favour and dont get this app you got better things to do with your life. Ask most of the people on here are PC teen snowflakes. 
i cant change privacy settings. its not letting me change the settings so anyone can comment it says setting restricted by tiktok and its really annoying change it
Just get adds instead of doing this. Please stop selling people information for money if you get adds you can get so much money please I love this app and I hate to know that it steals your information if you add some adds they will obviously come to your app or add purchases you can buy you&#39;ll get money but half the people on TikTok leave the app knowing this and please change this it&#39;s not nice your app could get banned for this
Change your information. I like the app I just dont understand why is it so hard to change simple information like your phone number You send them feedbacks and they never answer back
"GET. THIS. APP. NOW. this app is rlllly fun and a great way to relax and have fun with friendsif u r worried about privacy or inappropriate things, once a video is reported it gets taken down immediately afterwards the privacy settings are the best Ive seen on any appits safe aswell as soooo much fun so please get it"
"Tiktok is bad. Despite it being fun tiktok steals info, location, Face ID and more"
ITS TAKES ALL UR INFO IN THE PHONE. I JUST FOUND OUT THAT TIK TOK KNOWS ALL UR INFO ON UR PHONE ANDDDDD KNOWS UR WHERE U LIVE
Dont download this app. Dont download they take all your information and your families info
Review. Not impressimpressed with the new policy on bullying that my account is on privacy so you let me get doxxed and thats not legal do better tiktok cus I lost my job because u let the doxxing video stay up and all the hate videos should be taken down  I was only doing a oc video  very disappointed
Spying on us ?? HUGH?. We just found out that tik tok has been spying on us and looking through our data  No one is safe  People are worried and want to ban it  Delete it now you are NOT SAFE 
"Its okay..??. Its okay but with everything going on with you/yall getting data from our phones is kind of alarming, so if you could just let me know if your not doing that, that would be awesome thank you"
Worst app. Breaches your privacy and peoples life
Spyware. I had TikTok on my phone for almost a year. I deleted it after reading the third article about the app spying on users. This app is evil
"Delete immediately. This app is filled with cringe, harassment, and racism, not only that the Chinese government can also steal your personal info such as passwords, ips, and bank cards if you have a google account with any of your credit cards linked so dont get it"
"TikTok. Honestly awful, so many privacy concerns. TikTok is the central for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and so much more. Theres so many toxic trends its hard to keep track. Put this app to a stop"
"I hate myself for downloading. Honestly the worst thing ever, not only did they probably sell my data to the CCP, their app sucked so much"
"Terrible app. Im a security analyst and Ive analysed this app, as soon as you give it the permissions it asks for it literally sends your photos and other data to a foreign server and it continues to collect things like location and speech. Do NOT download this app. Also, the content on here is terrible"
"If you want it, fine. The only reason my account exists is because my little sister wanted an account, (Back in the days of musically)- so I let her use my email, thinking nothing of it. All was fine until TikTok bought it and she started to have some issues related to her IRL friends, who also had accounts whilst being underage- I wont go into any details, out of respect of privacy (dont worry, it wasnt anything too bad). I then created a second account for me and me alone- and went to see what was happening. Shes not taking things too well; our entire time on this app was a bad experience and we dont want to have anything more to do with it"
Star Review. Best app ever  Keep it building & growing but keep our data safe TikTok
Oof. My personal favourite feature is the way they harvest and steal ypur personal data wothout permission
"Fix the privacy policy. You guys need to fix the privacy policy because there are people that are 14 like me who want to gain a following so we can become influencers, and with the new update it affects us negatively, so I will ask you kindly to change it from 18 to 14. Thank you"
Help. I requested to download my data yet I can not because I no longer have access to the phone number linked to my account
TERRIBLE TOTAL GARBAGE. Please read this tiktok is really being used by the Chinese government to gather data about its users and tracking and really it was not even made to be a fun social media app it was made to track people down and know every last detail of them please delete this app immediately and if your a parent keep your kid away from this TERRIBLE GARBAGE
"Dangerous. In general this is just a terrible and cringy app but my main problems with this, is that it is basically controlled by the Chinese Maoist Government which allow them to steal your data do not download for your own safety"
Be warned. Its a great app but they can steal your data and sell it to Chinese companies- fbi are working on it atm- be careful
PRIVACY ISSUE. app has many privacy issues Acces location for no reason and lots of ads
TikTok Rocks. I cant believe the amount of information I have learned from this app
"IT IS SO ANNOYING. ALL I HEAR IS THIS IS FROM TICK TOCK, IT STEALS UR PERSONAL INFORMATION DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT"
DO NOT download. It cells your information to the Chinese Government
"ITikTok. Ive learned so much through the doctors on TikTok Then I take the info to my drs & financial advisor and Ive been able to dig myself out of a hole, mentally, physically and financially. Ive also been able to share videos with friends who dont have TikTok and they can still view and share in the fun. The platform is so easy to use to make videos that Ive played around with. Good stuff"
Information. TikTok allows you to get information about the last and past history
2-step verification. Add 2-step verification in privacy settings
"Fun but extremely dangerous and inappropriate. My daughter had so much fun on this app for years but then one day someone had hacked into her account, posted inappropriate content and then later on, posted her school, phone number, age, name and face. They then added in the caption section hmu I am bored my daughter was absolutely terrified when she saw this video out to the public. It also had 2000 views. She had countless phone calls coming in through her phone it caused her so much stress and pain. I cannot believe TikTok would put this on their For You page. The person did not get banned for 2 months after we reported it. This means that the content was up for that long. I have had to ban this app from my daughter. Very addictive as well. It also had very inappropriate content for kids, my daughter is 13 and I was scrolling through her For You page to see what she was looking at and found a video which said click the link in my bio for a surprise I tapped on it and there were nude pictures of women For a 13 year old Absolutely unbelievable TikTok and the person had had their account for over a year as that was how long the videos had been up for. Unbelievable. They didnt even ban them. Not even banned to this day. Very inappropriate. Would not recommend"
Delete Tiktok. Plzzz delete tiktok it is stealing your information
Bad-. Its a good app but it steals your data IF YOU SEE THIS SPREAD THE WORD AS IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR DATA SAFE
"banning accounts. it literally bans accounts and vids for no reason. like i love the app, its addictive, but i have had SIX accounts banned. for literally no reason at all. i have just made accounts and within MINUTES they were banned. and it doesnt even let me recover data from my banned accounts, like i had the the same account for 4 YEARS and it banned it with no explainiation, and when i tried to download my data and videos it didnt even work. ive sent multiple complaints to tiktok but their customer service is horrible. so they need to get this fixed asap"
THIS APP GOES HARD. simply being on tiktok &amp; being in the know has gotten me MAD b*tches. i love tiktok and i dont care who is getting my data and neither should any of you
Wow LOL. Kinda sad that yall can make a app but not moderate privacy and inappropriate behaviour
"Unnecessary Updates. The app overall is better than most, if not all social networks. Overall, 5/5. But what bothers me are the unnecessary updates. You keep removing some of the best features and adding unnecessary ones. For example, I no longer have the ability to favorite videos (I would like that back please) but now all my favorites are in a different place. Stories are fine but the notifications? Extremely frustrating to go through bc I keep thinking I clicked the dm button even though I didn't. This is all without mentioning the new privacy updates. I really think these updates are gonna kill the app. Good app, waiting for it to go back to the way it was tbh"
Scams. TikTok is good overall but has many ads that pop up. They are complete scams and want you to leak your ip. TikTok should get on this to make the platform safer for younger people and if they need ads then they can put up legit ads that dont want to track you or take your bank card information
"Ignorant. I am absolutely disgusted by how TikTok clearly dont read their emails. I have sent endless reports on the app and 2 emails. I have had no response at all. Im going to paste the email i sent in hopes somebody is kind enough to actually respond. This app is becoming a joke.  Hello Tiktok. Im contacting you because of an issue regarding my now old account. Around a week ago now I was trying to open the app, which kept crashing on me. It then told me to clear something, because it would help the app to work, but when it finally started to work I had been logged out of all accounts I was signed in with. The problem is I hadnt used a phone number or email to sign up with the account. I have tried endlessly to figure out my password but nothing is working. I reported this multiple times on tiktok, but nothing ever came from it. I just recently saw people leaving really negative comments on my most recent video which after reporting them, still wont delete. My account that got logged out was (took this out for privacy reasons)I can prove that it is actually me. My name is Chloe thrasher, it is the same username as my snapchat. My phone number is (I took this out but it is still on the email). I am 15 years old, and i can send picture proof that it is me. I shouldnt have been logged out, and would really appreciate if i could be logged back into it. I will then make sure to connect my phone number and email, and then change the password to something I can remember, and then delete all the negative comments people have left on my videos.  I had all my drafts, saved videos, and sounds on that account. Please could you get back to me asap. I am extremely worried that i wont be able to get back into the account. I had quite a few followers, and had lots of likes on one of my videos. I wasnt sure if this was the right email either, but its better to try. Thankyou.Also I have tried to report the negative comments, but not a single one has been deleted. Please get back to me on here, the app or on email. Thanks"
Its fun. So I love tiktok its amazing but may I ask do you actually steal our information because my mum said you do just asking otherwise love the app
Access to all your phones data. Delete this app immediately and turn off all of the allowance is on your phone because TickTock will download every single file photo song video text message and anything else you have in your phoneThey reserve the right to do this by circumventing the app stores policies delete this app or else they will have access to your bank accounts your passwords anything that can be used to ruin your life
bad. stealing info
PRIVATE VIDEOS POSTED. So its happened a few times now but my private tiktoks from like 2018 keep getting posted public??? This is REALLY annoying and a complete invasion of privacy Fix this now please I cant even delete my tiktok account because i have to verify my old number which i dont have to add my new one so i can send a code to delete my acc
This app is garbage do not download. The point of TikTok is for the Chinese government to spy on you and for people to get their blood pressures raised to dangerous levels I lost all but one of my accounts today because the app crashed out of the blue for no valid reason my storage was perfectly fine everything Im just now realizing theyres an update so I lost all of my accounts because this garbage fire of an app needed an update I dont care what the cool kids say this app is awful and thats an understatement
"Great app But something NEEDS to change. Okay tiktok, please read this The update means I cant put duet on or spread awareness for whats going on around the world. I also cant go live and it was me dream. Now do I have to wait till im bloody 18? Can you atleast put an option for these things so I can choose if I have the privacy restrictions? I find this ridiculous, and sad. I made an alt account to realise I couldnt comment on my videos or duet / switch. A few days later when I hit 1k, I cried. I checked to see if I could go live because I was about to unpack a gift. And I couldnt. I was so confused and upset, so I had to record it knowing if it was on the fyp people couldnt comment on it without them following me and me following them back. Please change this"
Useless. Cant compromise with the privacy
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app is made by the Chinese government and has the ability to access information on your phone. If you know some one who has it tell the to delete immediately. This is not a joke
Disgusting content. I have really enjoyed this app and was my favourite but recently I have been saying some awful content. Something has been going around and personal photos of a young lady have been leaked. Many people have been making it their profile picture and sending links to the photo. I have been reporting the profiles but I have to say that tiktok have been useless at stopping this situation and I am starting to believe that this app is just an opportunity for pedophiles to have conversations and share content with each other. I loved tiktok up until now and now I feel as if this app is not a safe space and that no one should be playing on this app if it is supporting this behaviour
Privacy Concerns. Having looked into this app I have realised that it is not safe to use. It is being run by the Chinese government to spy on western culture. They have access to all your personal information and bank details if you download this app so I would highly recommend to not download it. It got banned in India for a reason
Steals my data. Tiktok is stealing my data. That is why I deleted it
"Ajhsgskdbcnf. They changed the terms of use so they can now watch you through your camera even if your out of the app. They can access all your credit card info, search history, microphone etc"
Secretly accesses the clipboard (spying malware). Apple recently discovered a bug that TikTok was using to access the clipboard on peoples phones. Apps are only as good as the ethics of the companies that own them. This app is owned and operated in China. Need I say more. 
"You are already addicted if you have it. This app is addicting and advertises many bad topics, not to mention there are predators trying to grab children on this app. Another little thing, it asks for SO MUCH information about you. By downloading this app, you lose so much possibly private info to the owners of the app"
Disgusting. At first it was fabulous but then when everyone heard that TikTok apparently accent to phone steals all your data and probably sells on the dark web at first I thought it was just a joke but then when I started hearing it on the news and everywhere well I just deleted the app for my own safety
Chinese government. We know that you are stealing our data Chinese government
Review. As a creator I really enjoy the analytics part of TikTok as its very easy to keep track of your data...@chi_chismum
Disappointed. There has been countless accounts that are following me then messaging me link just to steel my personal information. I love TikTok but they need to stop these accounts
DO NOT USE THIS APP Controlled by Chinese Communist Party. Please do not download or delete as soon as possible. This app is controlled by Chinese Communist Party. Your privacy data will be used to spy against American and subject to authoritarian propaganda
Violation. Privacy issues. Violent contents
Terrible app. Steals your data and is straight up a toxic community
Why TikTok. My account got banned today and idk why I think it was a dance I did but I put emojis over my face. I was over halfway to my dream amount of followers (200) I just wanted a small page. Now it wont let me redownload the app and is asking for personal info to download it. TikTok is a good app but I think only rly bad things should get banned. I was just trying to be a good person and have fun
Tik tok is selling our information to the Chinese government. Its selling our info
steals data. bruh this garbage ass app steals your data
ILLEGAL DATA MINING. DO NOT USE. I was a daily user of the app until this morning a pop up came on the app as I opened it telling me 2 contacts from my phone were on tiktok. I didnt allow access to my phone book and confirmed that from my privacy settings. Beware. This app is illegally mining your data
Annoying. I had this App for some time but its a draining my cell phone battery. So I deleted it. I  was also also not comfortable with the privacy issues
"Spyware - uninstall immediately. This app is a spyware, its capturing everything you type, what you say and do  Uninstall if you care the tiniest bit about your privacy"
Terrible. It stores all of ur personal data and tracks u at all times but ur phone does that too what do u expect
Spam mail. Getting so many spam mail from third party of TikTok. Data might get stolen. not trustworthy
. this app is racist and ableist &amp; a huge invasion of privacy
privacy. great app for sending personal data to china
Good app. This is a good app its not bad and tiktok isnt stealing your information its like youtube
"Safety is an issue. As a minor on the social media app, TikTok, Ive been through a lot. Ive had old men follow me as well as people harass me over the age of 18. Keep in mind that I am a minor. Grown men, tend to follow me, as I am a teenage girl. I report things like this to TikTok and they say theres nothing wrong with this and its not violating guidelines. This makes me feel uncomfortable, as I do have a public acc, cause of work, etc. Ive also been harassed by other teens. Yes, I have used the block feature, but that doesnt stop everyone, as you can always make other accounts. People comment on my posts, hurtful things, resulting in cyber bullying. TikTok refuses to help me when I message them about it, resulting in an unsettling feeling for myself. Ive provided proof to this happening and TikTok still says that I shouldnt worry. TikTok strives to be a safe app for teens who wanna try to rise to fame, when in realty, its not as safe as they make it sound. As a teenager with 1.4k followers on my @your_local_bi_equestrian account, I do not feel safe on the app. I also know about the privacy feature, where you can have a private acc. I dont feel that makes me safe either way, as you still dont know who everyone is. Please consider safety before you download this app"
"Spyware. Info has come out saying this is spying on your device. Delete this app and your account now, as quickly as possible"
Tiktok is spying on you. Tiktok is spying on you
No. It takes personal information do NOT DOWNLOAD
"TikTok. Every time I make a new account it gets banned .Including my backup accounts ,I dont even post a single thing on my backup accounts .TikTok needs to do better. This app needs to look into more details with people and their content. Multiple banned accounts and Community Guidelines for no reason for posting dance no skin showing . Think about the people who really do the bad things .TikTok wont tell people what they did. Nor why they got banned .Saying download your data, well I never got it my accounts including (when I dont post AT ALL) . This isnt fair our race doesnt matter .shouldnt matter TikTok should want people on their app .Instead their taking us AWAY.TikTok do better reviews arent just for show there to get better . PLEASE DO BETTER .I am now mad how many times I had to go through this I am done .Please do better .ur a booty hole btw"
"Inappropriate, toxic, and unsafe. Tiktok used to be so fun but now its not as fun. I found out how it takes your data and tracks you then I deleted both of my accounts when I heard that, it was hard but I over come it. Why doesn&#39;t it want 12- not to have accounts they could take down sexual or harmful stuff for it to be safe for kids to have an account but they dont always do it.  I was 11 and my account gained alot of followers 2900 followers then tiktok banned my account it took months for me to stop crying over it but that couldve lead to depression for other kids. It has so many sexual things still up and that can lead to kids watching pornography everyday and doing sinful things. It also has evil trends on the app. If you have tiktok I urge you to delete yoir accounts and delete tiktok. I did it and you can do it too. Instagram is much safer"
app run by China. This app monitor your private life and activities then send it back to China Have fun with sharing your own privacy with Xi
TikTok is bad for you. The app take your Data like your contacts and basically need to follow The latest trends to get  popular instead of original content
HORRIBLE. TikTok banned me for no reason. And the give so much hate its annoying. Most of TikTok is for browsing but mostly copying videos and taking stuff from others and lying and they try to steal stuff like your personal info. I dont recommend
"ITS A SECURITY THREAT. THIS APP HACKED MY IPAD, STOLE ALL MY INFORMATION, DELETED ALL MY FILES, DELETED MY APPS, I HAD TO BUY A NEW IPAD JUST BECAUSE OF VERY PIKYPOK, I HATE IT, BYTEDANCE, MORE LIKE BYTACRINGE"
Do not download. If you want all your information to be leaked to the Chinese communist party then go ahead and download it
"delete it. i have been told to write this review because apparently this app steals your ip address and all your information,this is just a warning but yeah the apps crap"
"DO NOT GET TIKTOK THE APP WATCHES YOU. SOMEONE GET TIKTOK CANCELLED, THE APP WATCHES YOU ACCESSES ALL YOUR PRIVACY, IF YOU HAVE TIKTOK GET RID OF IT, THE APP IS TOXIC FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE, THEY BUY THEIR REVIEWS TO MAKE IT CLOSE TO 5 STAR APP WHEN ITS NOT IF I COULD RATE THIS APP ANYTHING LESS THEN 1 STAR I WOULD THIS APP SHOULD BE BANNED WORLDWIDE EVERYONE PLEASE USE TIKTOK AT YOUR OWN RISK"
Data. Im losing my dats on this app and im not even using it because i have wifi at home and  i check my data/cellular i have almost no data left
I already hate the new privacy update. I want people to be able to comment and duet my videos but with this new privacy filter I cant have people do that again. Ive been trying to grow my account for about a year and made a bunch of success. I almost have a 100 followers which has been my goal for when I first joined TikTok. It makes me sad that almost nobody can duet my videos or comment on them. I would appreciate it if you could change this update and Im sorry if Im annoying
Pls read this. The app is fine and I think they solved the personal data problem but be aware bc this app has people that are liking your comments and trying to make you press the link in their bio so pls be aware of that
"TikTok actively promote scams, fraud and other crime. Just scrolling through the For You page the other day, Im still brand new to the app, and saw people promoting fraud. They were showing how to get free food by abusing the reporting system of Uber Eats. Myself, along with many others, reported this and so far no action has been taken to remove the TikToks. Im a courier for Uber Eats so this affects me as its a self employed job and so, if somebody did this to me, I wouldnt be paid for that delivery. Then there are scams. I opened the app the other day and was greeted by some accounts promoting GTA V money generators and such, things that are clearly scams. Ive seen people committing crimes on it far too many times. All of these videos have been reported many, many times but TikTok nor Tencent have done anything to handle it apart from letting it continue. On the privacy side of things; Im not sure how TikTok works as I havent used it long but I havent shown any interest in GTA V and yet I was shown TikToks involving it anyway. However, I do _PLAY_ GTA V but have never shown interest on the app. How does TikTok know what games I play?"

THIS APP IS AMaZINg BUt. My parents think it steals ur info can u prove to them u dont?
Star Review. Best app ever  Keep it building &amp; growing but keep our data safe TikTok
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Ever since i downloaded this app, my life has gone to HELL My phone calls were forwarded, my text messages reviewed and i found my camera being used when i didnt turn it on This app invaded your privacy and my lawyer will be in contact with the police and the owners of Tik Tok, they will be sued for 5.6 million. Dont Download. im only joking by the way, but this app is shambles and i cant wait for the day its gone"
To tik tok. I love the app you also have privacy
TikTok hates LGBT creators. This app is owned by a Chinese company that forces everyone on the app to comply with communist censorship laws. So if youre LGBTQ your account could be terminated for no reason like mine was after not a single problem for 4 years. Beware that this app is also used to mine your personal data from your phone and spy on you as reported by several top media outlets
STOP USING THIS APP. this app steals your information Please uninstall and find alternatives
It is quite clearly stealing your data. I used to love this app but its started getting weird when I started watching some movies and tv shows and I started seeing on my for you page videos about that movie/tv show seems a bit weird and the face that there is a lot of discrimination between genders and races
ITS SO ADDICTING. I get so excited when I see I have a notification from tiktok becasue someone has followed me or has liked my video Its so addicting watching all these awesome and cool video But one thing I heard on the news a little while ago that tiktok (the company) has been taking everyones info and sending it to this place in China. So be careful But now I heard that tiktok got sold to Microsoft (a company we can trust) :)
Steals your data and spies on your family. Like being a CCP shill? Get Tik Tok
App bugs. So many bugs and d no data privacy
"From other reviews. The app is known to be invasive with privacy regulations and policies. They are quick to erase and suppress certain content but keep other controversial content up and trending. The algorithm is very much dull and limited, doesnt open the door to new content creators and forcibly makes you subscribe to larger content creators. However, it does have a great marketing tool and cool editing. Good platform for future creatives but only with a certain type of look"
China. Tiktok  just did a huawei and steals people personal data
"THIS IS A SPYWARE. In terms of conditions (which nobody reads)On the last line it says they have the right to grab your data, ITS A CHINESE SPYWARE. I recommend deleting immediately, also this app is racist (read other reviews to learn why)"
"DELETE OR DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Although tiktok is a great creative app a lot of toxic things happen in the comments such as bullying, racism and a lot more. this app may seem fun and happy but theres a lot more to what meets the eye there are people that say the n word and are still adored by their so called fans, people that say homophobic slurs, and dont even get me started on the group called the boys that make r@pe jokes as if its &#34;pure comedy or &#34;dark humour. recently tik tok has had a video on tiktok about a man kllng himself, I dont know much about this video as I myself havent seen it but it has had national warnings and children and/or teens and adults have been told to delete this app because the people that upload that exact video are 60 to 70% hackers its a very unsafe app and your data is at risk of getting stolen through it. There are profile pictures that are considered &#34;trends but have very dark or inappropriate origins. Such as a black and white monkey that is used to identify ped0phles and so they can communicate with other ones. And lastly if you still decide to keep this app please be careful and if you see one of the sucde videos pause it and report, block the user and video and try your best to get tiktok to delete these absolutely disgusting things that have become their app.    THANK U SO MUCH FOR READING THIS MUCH to make it clear I know I sound like a 40 year old Karen but Im actually 10 and want to share my opinion on this app :)"
PLEASE LISTEN. This is not a review it is a message as to why TikTok should not get banned or at least be given another chance to improve their privacy. TikTok has gotten me and my friends through some really dark times and I cant bare to live to see that go away. So many people have emotional attachments to TikTok including me. If TikTok shuts down their WILL be many protests against this so please I am begging you not to ban the app
Best app ever. I love tik tok but lots of ppl are talking about how the Chinese president can see ur phone iPad and that and get info also my account is private only my friends and family follow me and ppl I dont know are commenting fyp?? So..... they are also telling my friends apogee that girl is always on my fyp but my account is private I dont understand overall though IT IS 100000000% MY FAVOURITE APP I love it sooooo much 
Stupid. Good app but youre sick for collecting loads of our data
Trackers. Don&#39;t install TikTok and if you have it already stop reading and uninstall. First research. On google searchis TikTok a spy app? it will give you answers. It knows where you are when your phone is on
TRASH. This stupid app is a Chinese tracking app its trash I deleted my account cause its so stupid it STEALS AND PLAGIARIZES SPONGS ITS STUPID DONT DOWNLOAD
World Privacy Organization. Ban TikTok Now We have a petition on change.org called Ban TikTok and has 47M signatures as of Today at 3:37PM Sign it now And.... F*** YOU OWNER OF TIKTOK ~Donald Trump
Entertaining the sleepy when its needed. A awesome platform to spread everything and anything within its safety policy and data protection well done TikTok Keep thriving 
"TikTok IS BAD. To be honest when I first using TikTok, my phone kept glitching, and when I deleted TikTik it went back to normalAnd TikTok can steal your information and put it online TikTok is inappropriate and is for 15+Predators can watch you and steal your information Hackers can take your account so they see everything youre doing on the appIt can turn into an addiction A lot of people are being bullied on TikTokPeople are starting to get really crazy on the app Dangerous challenges can influence kids hobbies"
Steals data toxic community. Says it all in the title
TikTok. Its a very good app and would recommend. I get to follow my friends and their friends and get to see what everyone is up to The app has some privacy issues but I havent experienced it myself Best app EVER Im obsessed
Bruh. I dont know if they still do this but like stop taking our personal information
"EVERYONE STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP. I do have the app myself, but I just done some research.Tik Tok is owned by a  company which I cant remember the name of, and the security level is 1/5  That means its terrible security.Hackers can get in your accounts and steal info.BEWARE"
"Pls read. Good app overall, I think it should definitely have more privacy options for example if you dont want to see inappropriate content there should be a setting for that I think a lot more people would let their teenagers get the app if it was more private and had more restrictions on what people can post aka. No evident inappropriate footage, No posting pictures or videos of violence ect"
"ITS A SECURITY THREAT YEET. THIS APP HACKED MY IPAD, STOLE ALL MY INFORMATION, DELETED ALL MY FILES, DELETED MY APPS, I HAD TO BUY A NEW IPAD JUST BECAUSE OF VERY PIKYPOK, I HATE IT, BYTEDANCE, MORE LIKE BYTACRINGE"
Tiktok is everything I needed in my life. When I first hear of Tiktok I didnt know what it was or what you do in it. When I first saw LaurenZsides Tiktoks videos I thought this was amazing so I give it a go and it was incredible I love every bit of it and I hope it never leave I hope it stays forever. I am so grateful if this app because if I never found this app I wouldnt be who I am now.
"Dont do it. As much as TIk tok is fun and entertaining, they a tualy collect your information and even if you arent on the TIk tok app at the moment but u have it, it still looks through your phone and scans your face then collects that info and send it to the Chinese government. They actually recently got fined a record fine for collecting info on people and children. Record fine means like the biggest fine they could have been fined lol. Anyways do u and your familys safety, dont get TIk tok. Is it rlly worth it?"
"Delete this all. Dont use this app, China government will hack ur phone n take ur data n spy on everyone"
"Its the go-to app for everything. Its great for businesses, personal use, and education. TikTok is about to wash all other apps out"
Pinion. My pinion is good TikTok so far but some customers they using abuse clips videos or comets i would like the TikTok management have under control peoples doing that abuse for first time give them warning the second time good byee for theirs TikTok account. Thanks for ask my personal pinion
"DELETE IT NOW. I used to love it and then I found out it is made by a company in China and they take information about YOU YOUR MESSAGES YOUR APPS YOUR PICTURES, YOUR SEARCH HISTORY DELETE IT.PLEASE TIKTOK STOP TAKEING INFORMATION PLEASE SO I CAN HAVE IT BACK"
HORRIFIC APP. BRUH- IT STEALS YOUR PERSONAL INFO DO NOT DOWNLOAD PLEASE I AM WARNING YOU
Communist propaganda tool. Do not use this app. Anything related to Chinese communist party should be trashed. Would not surprise me if this app steals information about you from your phone.They sensor content that is against Chinese Communist Party
"Its good. This app is very good but one problem.There is a chance that they are tracking your message when you download it, pictures, and calls. If this is true STOP. If you are thinking about getting it your better off finding clips of it on YouTube. I am also going to slowly get off the app because this stuff is MY PERSONAL BUSINESS. I dont suggest but its your life"
CCP. Im a little concerned on trusting data to a foreign regime....good app though
"DO NOT INSTALL. Tiktok is a Chinese company which steals your information and sells it to other Chinese companies who keep this info about you, thats super creepy. Tiktok says they dont share anything but this isnt true #deletetiktok"
Disgusting. They delete videos by people raising issues on racism or political views but keep far-left videos from white supremacists. They deleted hashtags about black lives matter but only sneekily included them back when there was a twitter uproar. They also let terrorist groups and political parties have a stronghold and continue to use tiktok to post their propaganda. They keep your data and pass it to communist governments. Accounts making videos of current events such as black lives matter are being suspended. Anyone talking about the hong kong protests are also finding their videos and a counts deleted.Moderators know exactly what they are doing. Because it has been noticed for months. I can&#39;t use this app knowing all of this is happening. Everyone is being stripped free speech. Disgusting
"Fix some of your guidelines please. I love this app. Ive been using it for years and I havent grown tired of it. Just last year I decided to start posting more and more on my account because I wanted my creativity to go out to others, but recently your new guidelines ruined that. I dont like posting my face on my account for personal reasons which leads me to just post a picture with text on it that comes from media I like. The issue is that with your new guidelines, my content wont reach my desired audience, let alone half of my existing audience. My content used to reach a lot of people and actually made it on the for you page but now it hardly gets any attention. I already tried reporting the problem and talking to some of my mutuals on the app to see if theyre experiencing the same issue and it turns out that they are"
"Community Guidelines. I am always on tiktok but I know Im not the only one who gets their account banned for absolutely no reason I didnt post, say, or do anything wrong. I read the privacy and community guidelines violation terms, and I didnt do any of that I know that it is bad to post inappropriate stuff on social media. So I am confused why I am logged out of BOTH of my accounts I tried everything and nothing will work so now Im writing a review. Tiktok please give me my account back, thank you"
Waste of time. This app is a waste of time and it ruined my mental physical and emotional health also there are not accounts the can track your location and there are so many people hating on other people that did nothing wrong for example jellybean meowbah and other children that wanna be like them so if you want all of that to happen go ahead and download this app
Hurting kids for ad money. I downloaded this vile app for the sole purpose of voting it down. TikTok repeatedly ignores all kinds of abuse for the sake of the money it makes selling our private data off to ad companies
"#BlackLivesMatter. shady privacy policy, racist developers, racist users. down with tiktok"
"DELETE IT. I loved tiktok it was amazing its so fun, but theres hackers, there hacking where u live, your tiktok account and your whole phone data, I have 1000 followers but I had to delete it, please stay safe"
Time consuming. Its very time consuming Uses up loads of mobile data Its very addictive / dont spend to much time on there Theres lots of good content
Dont download TikTok. Very high chance this app is spying on you
Musically. TIKTOK TRACKS DOWN YOUR LOCATION GETS YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND TELLS PEOPLE THAT INFORMATION and I want musically back
Good app. It is a very good app but there are many people who use it to steal information. My advice is to improve the security or quality of reports because many use very grotesque language when they are in live videos
Getting Lots of good information. Learning so many things from this app
Change info. Tiktok does not help with the change of my information
shawtyslikeamelodyinmuheadthaticantkeepoutgotmesinginglikenananaeverydaylikemymindgotstuckonreplay. I really enjoy the app and think its extremely good. U can easily change privacy settings if wanted and I think its good for ages 10+. I would recommend the app and think u should get it
"This app should be banned all over world. Useless full of copyright violation, and violating peoples &amp; policeman&#39;s privacy policy , being misuse by some groups"
Personal information stealing. Tik tok steals ur personal info and saves ur drafts I am not using it anymore
Privacy nightmare even if you dont care. Tracks literally everything you do
What a load of SH*T. So fed up with seeing this everywhere- I dont know why people go so crazy over rubbish like this that is basically hidden spywhere. And people wonder why their personal data gets stolen
Unsafe for your data. This app very unsafe for your data india banned this app delete this app thank u
Btw. Btw STOP USING YOUR APP TO SPY ON PEOPLE AND KILLING THERE PRIVACY YOU SICK F***
mfing tiktok read this . tiktok istg if ur reading this take my privacy thing off my sister put it and now it think im 13 and is restricting my mf pivacy pls take it off my acc user is hkv4mp thx 
REDACTED. Listen here Chinese government Im going to say this once and once only if you dont delete this app and give YOUR people rights itd be the last thing you do also other countries have banned Tik Tok and I think REDACTED does the same I KNOW you plan on spying on girls and even MY DAD and before you say  sorry REDACTED we dont plan on spying on people its just a good app NO Im always watching so you better watch out as you dont know when you could get ambushed at anytime any where so you can get me but youd never find me
"change. There needs to be a change i had an account for 3 years and was banned it was false there support didnt do anything i had my information stolen, i just got banned again today"
"Hmm. The app is good and all but it seems to be Chinese spyware. So yeah. I dont want my data getting sold, sorry"
"Malware. The Chinese government has all of your data if you download this app, should be taken off the app store"
Data mining. Worst app ever who always does data mining of your personal phone. They already got your permission while you accepted the terms and conditions so please uninstall this app
Propaganda app. Chines app to get peoples private data
"rip tiktok. honestly, its good that tiktok is getting banned. who knows what china needs our information for. who cares if its addicting. your privacy and data is much more important then some dumb little app. rip tiktok. u wont be missed"
"worse. i saw a video of a guy saying that you guys are tracking all the accounts and knowing theyre location, everybody at is seeing this, please delete your tiktok account, tiktok finds your search history,location,number and a lot more"
"Privacy settings. I absolutely love TikTok and how I can post my edits on the website and make new friends along the way. The thing that gets me is that Im above the age where a lot of things should be restricted for younger viewers, when people try to save my edits for a competition or something, it wont let them save them and some of the features my main account has doesnt show up on my editing account"
"Good but concerning. Tick tock is very fun, and Ive started to use as a news source now because its spreading a lot of good information, especially about black lives matter, however Ive heard that it steals a lot of your information; stuff it doesnt need, like what device youre using, your search history, what other apps you have, idk. Not just to sell to third parties as well, I heard it was to see who was loyal to the Chinese government(but that might be a conspiracy). Not sure if any of thats true, but its a little worrying. Tl;dr Great app, might be stealing all your info and selling it to the Chinese government tho"
Best way to have your data sold to companies. Its just sells data best way to break the USA and US laws
Good but worried about data. Just worried about my data otherwise very good app
"Some serious questions. I love this app but sometimes theres gacha heat, $3x,showing their privacy area,and abuse. Like TikTok used to be dancing app now what happen to TikTok?"
Amazing but. TikTok is a amazing and fun app but the more you scroll the more risky and inappropriate it gets The good side is that you can share videos with friends and family and you can maybe upload some videos your self(but dont make them about you personal information and inappropriate comments and videos).But the bad side is.that you could have a hacker trying to hack into you account. For example say that youve had you account for 2 years now so your acc just turned 2 years old and then a couple days later it gets deleted. So the hacker (this is not if it just randomly gets deleted) back to the beginning. So the hacker could of been in your account for years. So be safe on TikTok have have fun. Thank you
Ccp aint stealing my data. Ccp want you to download this app to steal your data
"Im homeless now. When you download this app, it will automatically download viruses on your device, which will then hack into your bank account and fraudulently deprive you of your money, hence my aforementioned homelessness"
Tiktok. I never have an issue with the app and I love to see what others have to post. Its a great way to stay connected and get information fast
Delete this app. Delete Tik Tok it is gathering all of your information and it can lead to dangerous things
Ban it. Its time to stop we do not need a scam app that steals you info ban tik tok now it will be banned one day
"For reddit. Hey do yall remember the time tiktok got sued for collecting data on people younger than 13, meaning theyre still doing that but to people older"
I see the Chinese lies. I am aware this app is a secret data machine for China dont download unless you want all ur private information lost
TIK TOK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEAAASE READ. YOU ARE TRACKING PEOPLE YOU YRACK WHAT IS TYPED BY USERS YOU ARE DISRESPECTING INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THEIR PRIVACY LOOK IT UP IF YOU WANT MORE INFO I AM (NOT) LYING AT ALL I PROMISE
Tik Tok. This app looks cool but it looks at youre information and know all youre friend and any web sites you go too that gives the person who made the app information
"Racists. This is app sucks and has proven they only care about a small particular group of its users. They allow racists, homophobic and xenophobic posts to stay up but try to silence users from using the platform to advocate for the lives of minority groups Plus spying and collecting users information and violating privacy rights. DISGUSTING SHAMEFUL HORRIBLE"
BAD. TikTok is NOT a good app especially for kids because they have all these people trying to get your information and trying to hook up and when uu report these accounts they do nothing about it
Stealing child info. If ur child has this app then tell them to delete it as the creators of tik tok have been fined $5.7 million for stealing childrens info
"Worst app possible. If I could give this 0 stars I would. TikTok is racist, sexist, homophobic etc. Many accounts of mine have been banned and my user and bio was banned for a while multiple times. Why? Because it had lesbian and minor in it. I want men to know I am lesbian so most of them will leave me alone and I have minor in there so most old men and grown adults wont follow me or anything like that. If TikTok actually supported LGBTQIA+ my accounts and bio wouldnt have been banned. Not only that I have been banned from using comments for a while multiple times for stupid reasons like saying Of course I support Im lesbian Really? Wow how homophobic. Not only that I said Trans men are REAL MEN and trans women are REAL WOMEN but yet again I got banned from using comments for a while. How transphobic correct? Not only that accounts who are spreading awareness about sexism and racism and homophobia also transphobia and there horrible traumatizing past are also getting shadow banned or banned in general. Lets not forget the accounts who are also spreading awareness about toxic relationships and different types of abuse like mental, emotional and physical abuse. This is a horrible app, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic etc. Please copy and paste this or make another 1 star review like this to try and get this app taken down from the App Store it doesnt deserve to be in the App Store. If what I said wasnt good enough may I add that TikTok is putting racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic TikToks on the for you page? Also TikToks that are not following the community guidelines and terms and privacy? Accounts that are leaking ages of random people, addresses of random people, telling people to kill themself, telling people death threats and threats in general, telling false info about covid and other general stuff, animal cruelty, spam, dangerous acts, self harm, suicidal stuff, dangerous individuals, pornography and nudity, body shamming, being homophobic, being transphobic, being racist, being sexist, burning LGBTQAI+ flags, sexually assaulting and assaulting people in person, using things like Karl starving himself or lgbtqai+ or racism or sexism for clout, treating homophobia and transphobia and racism and sexism etc as a trend, people following younger children and then telling them to click the link in there bio which some kids dont know better and that link brings the kid to an only fans account, people putting there only fans in there bios in general, people with inappropriate profiles, people with inappropriate bios, people calling others with disabilities etc rude names life elephant or horse or dinosaur or midget or giraffe or scar face or freak or mistake etc you get the idea, and just horrible people in general. There I just named off like 50 more things of why you should copy and paste this or write a review similar to this giving TikTok 1 star. Now.. No matter how old you are, where you are, what your doing whatever Please rate TikTok 1 star and copy and paste this review there or write a similar review to this Get this horrible app off the App Store because Ive heard a couple people have committed suicide because of this app. Lets get rid of TikTok and its horrible people"
Its a nasty app. Its a nasty app it gets all the information from your phone and passes it onto Chinese spy agencies
This app is so bad for banning what did u do. Hello why did I get banned like what did I do I went through all guidelines and I did nothing and its also permanent so like what you guys dont even say what I did like now I cant even do anything and I have to wait for 4 days for what do request data??? Thats just kinda not good like when you ban someone you should tell them why come on tiktok god????
"My time has come. This app is honestly disgusting, this is a way to get Chinese people to get all of your personal info and could possibly get your address, this app allows racism aswell and the people who are taking this racism get THEIR profile deleted. Whatever you do, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD"
"Spyware. If you havent heard tik tok is spyware meaning its spys on you and collects your personal information including but not limited to your device and ip. Dont download unless you want your information given to the Chinese government, also if you have it delete it ASAP"
"Time Waste and Data Waste. This app is time waste app ,"
It took info that I did not want it to. 0/10 fix itSo when I first used it it was great but then I saw a lot of gacha heat and weird things like that but then bad words like the f word and the n word and its not safe for kids like me I used to have a account but it got banned for no reason tik tok is becoming stupid to people and then it took my pictures and I looked and it was tracking meWach out tik tok some people might and can sue you
"GARBAGE. so turns out TikTok is a spy, if you make videos it will track you and find out your private contact and that DO NOT LET KIDS GET THIS APP"
Bad stole information. Do not download they stole my credit card information its also not a good app
Banned for no reason. TikTok banned my account for no reason. The account they banned me in had multiple videos of my dogs that passed away. If you have data you want to share. Use Instagram or Facebook
"my own opinion on TikTok. Dear TikTok , I Love this amazing app and all those lovely updates. But Ive seen most teenagers for example 18+ or adults over 20 have been showing innapropriate stuff. Some people even leak most peoples address. Please make an update that when someone is either showing privacy spots or leaking addresses Please scan the video to make sure its safe. If its Not Please TELL them to Not post it  Over all this app is amazing"

Stop. Stop looking at our private info
Spyware. Never forget this is a Chinese product and the Chinese state has direct access to all companies and by default your data
"Playlists. Love tiktok, go on it everyday. But Im super annoyed, I have an account with 13K followers and still cant access playlists yet everyone else can? All my privacy settings are set to public and allows everyone to comment download etc. I cant update tiktok as apparently its not in need for an update but I know it is, can you explain??"
Information. They illegally sell your info to china
Good. This is a great social media app. I love how it allows you to be creative in so many diforent ways.... the only complaint that I have about this app is the stealing of information.  I really hope it doesnt get banned in the us
Great app. This app got a lot of information
Tracking. This app tracks all your personal data and its a Chinese app so imagine your childrens naked pictures seen by the Chinese. that would not be very family friendly this app really should be taken off the App Store and play store also I didnt mention trackers like cookies
Chinese spies. download this if you want all your personal info leaked and want to have no privacy whatsoever
Privacy setting. Im so sick of people using privacy setting and turning off comments
Mobile data. You use so much mobile data stop taking so much data
Wanna get your info stolen. Just saw that they used this to collect info on people and young children deleted it soon after please dont let your child use this
"Im kinda afraid now but I dont know if there is anything wrong. I have had TikTok for about 2-3 years but because of the news its been saying that the app is unsafe and that it goes through your phone and collect data.Ive enjoyed TikTok for years and even though I never got on the for you page it was having fun But from family members and the news its been saying that the app is unsafe and when I started messaging my friends about it, my phone was asking me to change my Apple ID password and I pressed no and it asked again, I started to panic and deleted the app.TikTok I want to know if your app is safe and why the news has been saying these things?"
"Chinese item. Data privacy is the issue, stop using it"
"Always listening. The app seems to be always listening, what ever your talking about during your day, youll always get a TicTok related video.Apples privacy feature is false and misleading"
"Best App. Tiktok is great, access to a lot of information in a lot less time"
"Disgusting. The app picked up a conversation I had regarding my grandmothers death. My dad called to tell me she would be cremated. That same day a TikTok in my feed featured a man putting his grandmothers ashes into a coffee mug. I had not googled, or searched, or commented anywhere online about cremation. Such an invasion of privacy and disgusting use of the algorithm. Later on a TikTok of the cremation process found its way to my feed and I deleted the app.  The algorithm is invasive and TikTok is selling very private information to third party apps and businesses"
"An Alarming Amount of Young Children This must stop. With all the chatter and sudden interest with this new app, I decided to download it, just to give it a go. Im a teen.  Ive had Tiktok for over a month now. I can tell you, its quite addictive. Amazing, different and inspiring content by influential creators. Though there is one thing that deeply concerns me. Its the kids. By being on tiktok for a few minutes, its plain obvious that this social media app isnt for youngsters. Severe amounts of sexual references- deeply descriptive as well. Im not complaining about this however, as most teens (and over) who are the main intended audience are used to this in daily language. Im complaining about the alarming amount of 6 year olds who are on here watching half naked  people flirt and do dirty actions with a sexually explicit song in the blasting in the background. This must stop. I strongly suggest that anyone under the 13-14 age bracket shouldnt be exposed to what is on here. And this is me saying it, as a 14 year old. On top of my previous point, These kids know nothing about protecting their privacy. Their sick parents may think otherwise, but you dont need to go far down the comment section without children openly telling strangers what road their primary school is on. For their own god darn safety, these babies are going to have to wait another 8 years until they get the app. I really think you should be more strict about it. Thankyou"
"Trash. Trash Chinese Spyware and is selling our data, also unfunny content"
Question. Good app but getting on for you page is hard also heard that the app is getting ban and steal information is that true?
Privacy settings. I have some really embarrassing TikToks from awhile ago and around 1000+ of them please could you perhaps think of adding a quicker delete button or the option to private all videos at once. Apart from that the app is good
"WARNING: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Please, listen to me. Do not download this app. It contains bad words on the videos, people naked, and they can scam you. This is real. People are crazy these days.. When you make an account, it might say you need your phone number or email.  TikTok is a Chinese considered app. They add the email and phone number thing so they can hack in your accounts. You need privacy you know. Make sure not to download apps from Chinese Bussinesses. This is a horrible app. Kids should not download this app. Always make sure to check there gadgets. A lot of TikTok videos are violent, scary, and RACIST THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER  This app smells like garbage"
Bad App. Not safe for your data
"The worst app i have EVER downloaded. I can not believe i was dumb enough to download this app. If u dont want your data and privacy to be exposed, do NOT DOWNLOAD THIS I had to reset my phone, terminate my account AND i had to get a new icloud account This app tracks your data 24/7, spamming you with notifications and sharing your data with the chinese government. DO NOT BUY ON ANY CIRCUMSTANCES"
"This App should come with a warning. Tiktok is no doubt an immersive and platform transcending app which can connect billions of people from all around the world depending how ridiculous and viral the content is,But the FYP page is like cocaine, it knows what you like and it knows how you like it. Before you know it, you have spent hours of your life on it.The app is absolutely incredible for creators and content consumers if you use it responsibly, but it can also be abused"
HACKS PHONES. I have just heard in the news that TikTok can hack your account and that is sad. Do not download please
Getting banned. TikTok is very good however peoples accounts are getting banned for no reason. Me and all my friends accounts have suddenly gotten banned and we have lost all our data
My tiktok review. I love tiktok but I always find myself using my data watching it so if you could add a update where you dont need internet that should be totally awsome
"Terrible app. Full of pedos, and also it is a security risk to anyone who doesnt want the Chinese government having all your info"
"TikTok. *****PLEASE READ*****The Indian government has justifiably banned TikTok from over 1 billion of its citizens. This app was created and originated in China by the technology company ByteDance, founded by the billionaire Zhang Yiming. The Chinese Communist government can use this app as a tool to gather data of its users. India has put a stop to transmitting users data in an unauthorized manner. Other countries may follow. This is one of the tools the Peoples Republic can use to control the narrative and release propaganda to the 10s of millions of followers. There is also major concern of its content and its claim that its appropriate for anyone of at least 13 years of age. Parents have no way of filtering any inappropriate content either. Please, please educate yourselves. The world at large is already dealing with a world pandemic which arose from China. The Chinese government is flagrantly using this opportunity of our home restrictions due to COVID to monopolize the markets and accelerate their agendas. Simply delete the app"
"This app is gay asf. I reverse engineered the app, and uh oh data stealing uh oh looks like they know my location uh oh"
Propaganda. This app is a tool from China for them to data mine North American information. Stop supporting this junk
Stop. This user based TikTok is stealing data and photos
Dont get TikTok. TikTok is just spyware app from China collecting lots of information from children and adults. It is absolutely disgusting how they invade peoples privacy. The videos on TikTok are also terrible and mostly just videos that make no sense. DO NOT GET THIS AWFUL SPYWARE APP
Chinese spying app. Im over the legal required age for TikTok yet couldnt make an account was annoyed now Im glad that the Chinese spies cant steal my data
Im doing this for safety. I found lots of critical reviews saying they steal data omg they stupid head not people with reviews TikTok
"Im Happy with how it turned out but. Well I think everyone downloaded it as a joke cause I did But I have a complain I think thats its annoying that you have to put your email and phone number but thats okay The thing thats so annoying ,is that these Indian Men Are Attacking and hacking zoenuts fanpage, I dont know if its true so yeah Last one is that Ive seen that tiktok is like a hacking app,so basically it wants your info to hack into your device and more Anyway I dont know if its true but I dont like it Anyway that me done Id you wan Go Follow my tiktok its Friend_ForeverGroup Love you all   "
"Dont censor the hate. TikTok is removing bad reviews and after several hours on this app I can say I hate it, its vine without the magic and its used by China to mine our data"
The worst app it takes all your personal data. the worst app it takes all your personal data
Doesnt work (help please). Does not let me login whatsoever. I cant open the privacy policy and the app is buggy. I would like help for this from TikTok them self. Or anybody who could help
No privacy or public option. My tiktok is private I got to what I need to fix it it doesnt show no public option when u log in Im on iOS is it not made for iOS?
Spreading Terrorism. First they will take your data and send it to china without inform you. Then they will use it in dark web. So install this app on your own risk. My job was to inform you
"Good. Very good and addictive, fun app However privacy theres still privacy concerns"
They steal your data. It is really bad some videos break community guidelines I recommend Reddit
Personal information. Hi I have messaged tiktok saying that I need to figure out the password to my account which I havent used email and phone number isnt working and I have forgotten my passwords I urgently need to change the profile picture. Pls could you figure out the password
"Hayleys. I love TikTok but not how the Chinese  Government sells your information to others people.Also when TikTok deletes my account every 3 months oh and you should be able to change you user name in less then 30 days.Personly I love TikTok I love the dances, music,people and you can really have fun."
"AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS APP (Do not download). Tiktok is a very dangerous app and is used to STEAL public information and give it to the Chinese communist party They steal it through simcard details and that can be VERY sensitive details. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP There is a reason why the US, Pakistan and Australia are gonna ban it It is VERY unsafe and can steal data from you and sell the information This app is a spy app to gather all of your information and sell it off India has already banned this along with 58 other apps, this is a data stalker and very unsafe DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IS A CHINESE SPYWARE SYSTEM AND CAN STEAL YOUR MONEY"
"Its pretty good. Dont get me wrong I love tik tok but I would only change the privacy problems. After all, we do want everything be safe on social media"
This app is trash. This app is trashhh who made it I want musically back or else I will sue you and your family or do you have even have a family. All the creators are stalkers and should be going to jail for taking down my videos for no reason at ALL. And and I will get my mommy to come to your house and watch in your sleep;) so if you dont want me to do any of this then DELETE THE APP And even my friends think your app is TRASHHH and they want musically back and dont even get me started on your dumb updates like bruh no one cares that you changed your privacy settings so just SHUT UP
. It is very entertaining and exciting the only thing I would change is the privacy when you are public thats it I really enjoy the app
My information. It deleted my other review but just to Catch you up on it. It stole my credit card information and sold it to China and for the past year scammers kept on calling me it is so annoying I lost it this does not deserve to be a one star its a 1% Tic tok is gonna se this and 100% gonna delete this
It wont show privacy for me. I cant even read this because it wont show privacy
Sends you data to China. Your personal identity and Data is more important than you think it is
Delete. This is a terrible app it will send you data to people so they can contact you. Recommendation delete it
"Sus. If you value your privacy, dont install"
oporatorsoul. I like it its just dont get tiktok banned dont do that data stealing
"China is stealing our data. Tiktok is a stupid app for 14 year old girls, major cringe, but more importantly our data is being stolen by people working for the ccpThis actually isnt a joke, DELETE THE APP"
GET RID OF THIS. THERES THIS NEW UPDATE WHERE ALL THE INFO JUST FLOATS ON THE SIDE WITH ALL THE LIKES AND COMMENTS AND HASTAGS AND ITS REALLY PISSING ME OFF GET RID OF IT NOW OR I WILL DELETE MY TIKTOK AND LEAVE A BAD REVIEW ON YOUR GOD DAMN APP THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME SINCE IT RUINED MY LIFE
Great app. No adds and you can connect with youre friends and have privacy still
Pros and Cons. Its pretty good but at the same time not---Pros of this app:-Useful life hacks-Funny things-Gaming stuff-Your favourite social influencersand many moreThe cons of this app..-Tiktok Banning many innocent people for no reason-Can track you ig- Not banning inappropriate content-Too much Drama and cults-Hateand more.For the adults who are reading this. Please keep your kids safe. it is a 12+ app and there are too many traumatic things that they shouldnt be seeing. Thank you. Stay safe<3
I bet you wont read this. App controlled by Chinese government designed to build a profile on children to later send targeted information to them. Be very aware that by signing up for this up your giving away all your internet history and they can spy on your emails to.I dont every leave reviews... Ever BUT this is basically that Russian spy face swap app only much worse
"Tiktok is hacking you. I downloaded it and one day later, my iPad got hacked. Like all my photos disappeared, my money gone, all my apps deleted. I had to buy a NEW IPAD This is hacking you. Do not buy"
Garbage App. Not only is this app full of indecent videos but it is also ran by a communist country. Additionally tiktok has no respect for copyright and has also been known to spy through peoples mobile phones. Google search byte dance tiktok and know who you really are supporting by installing this trash app
"Almost worse than Facebook. Why would anyone in their right mind download this app. Scroll down on the App Store page and look at the information it collects from your device. Youre basically selling your soul, but for free"
"Tracks you. They track everything on your iPhone including messages, photos, and your email"
Sneaky?. Can you please stop collecting data from our SIM cards? I dont think a content creator app has no reason to do this unless you wanna steal the data. In fact the app doesnt even request for a permission to access location. Why so sneaky?
"Delete this app. Besides this app could spy on your phone, every person works for them is dumb,"
"Amazing app. This app is Amazing You can express yourself and gain followers There is a privacy setting that makes your account private so you can allow them to see your content. You can like,share,duet,react to other peoples videos Its a great way to make funny content and anything you would like Go follow my TikTok sadieellisofficial"
"Why. Used to be my favourite app and then people started being very toxic and rude. Tiktok doesnt take down videos that promote bullying, but removes videos with a shoulder showing? Also, Im over 16 and I never gave my personal information like my birthday or age to tiktok and somehow I am no longer allowed to direct message because Im under 16??? Please change this NOW"
Its ok. People are really toxic and horrible on this app its also a data collector but it is fun for lots of people because you can watch really cool stuff and make videos and make friends
"Chinese Spyware. This app is basically Chinese spyware. Do not download it if you care in any way about your privacy. If you already have it, I advise you to delete it immediately"
"Amazing, 1 problem though. I love tiktok, but I have one thing that annoys me. I have 2 accounts and one is public an I wanna view my analytics. But my other acc which is private has both of my contact info (e-mail and #) I just want to have the option to take one off of my account and then I can put it on another"
CCP Spying app. Will spy on your data
"CuSandra JonesDavis. Tic Tok is very enlightening. There is a large variety of educational information, health, exercise, mental and emotional. As well full of laughter filled entertainment. There is the aspect of world events and important news that is being shared. New technology and different business ventures. I would say that Tic Tok is offering the ability to connect worldwide on a totally different level. I am becoming more and more fond of the app. I only have one gripe and that is the fact that you cant change your personal information like your name. Im recently remarried, a little over a year now and it adds offense to my ex husband as well as present that I still carry my ex husband last name. I definitely think your personal information options should be updated. Keep spreading encouragement and joy"
Entertaining the sleepy. A awesome platform to spread everything and anything within its safety policy and data protection well done TikTok Keep thriving 
Data. It steal your data and awns to China delete right now
Idk about it. I used to have this app and I loved it but my strict parent made me delete it because their is rude/inappropriate stuff on it (btw Im 13). Maybe a child lock of some sort would be nice. Also Ive heard people say something about tiktok and how its hacking ur phone and knows everything about u as soon as u go on it. Like I said Ive deleted because on my parents but i was going to anyway with all the rumours
"Best Social Media Platform at the moment. Made for a large number of following, splits notification displays in organized categories, filters are the most up to date, privacy settings are easy to manage. Very satisfied"
"Just delete it, it problematic. Tiktok is very problematic. Loads of famous tiktok stars have gotten huge amounts of hate. Also people are saying the app is collecting your personal information which ISN&#39;T great. Just delete  it and change it to a editing app or something like that"
"banning accounts. Tiktok is great and all, but the amount of time that private accounts that posted NOTHING wrong or did absolutely nothing wrong get banned is crazy. I myself have been through like 5 accounts even though ive broken none of the privacy policies. PLEASE stop letting bots ban innocent accounts because most of the time there is no good reason and just makes more and more peopl frustrated and dislike the app. STOP. Also, if you are going to ban accounts, at least make the phone numbers used for them valid again, because i cant keep making emails and phone numbers. PLEASE FIX IT OR CHANGE IT please unban @..jess1ca_beasley"
"So bad. Doesnt let you get rid of your phone number which is not good for your privacy. Also, when you report accounts. Even for the worst reasons, it doesnt delete the videos or delete the account. Which I think is silly"
"Horrible Company. The app aggressively targets those that oppose racist conservative values. I get banned constantly for speak out about LGBTQ rights or political issues (currently Ukraine) they censor those fighting for equality while boosting those that support anti semitism, anti POC, and most importantly openly allowing white supremacists to not only be active but to spread their neo nazi ideologies. Meanwhile Im banned for saying anyone who starts a war should be quartered. No cursing, no deragatory slurs, just an opinion that doesnt align with TikToks love for white supremacy and anti minority ideologies. Im not even a minority but they make it overtly obvious who they support and who they support are white nationalists and hate groups.This app also put personal identification and sensitive information on my profile and refused to let me change it saying you cant edit your profile info due to breaking multiple community guidelines. This was within 20 seconds of making my account without me even viewing a video. My personal information was stuck on my account because this scum bag account refused to let me delete it. I hope your company goes bankrupt"
"I thought it was ok until. I reverse engineered the app, and uh oh data stealing uh oh looks like they know my location uh oh"
"Not a fan. Just go to YouTube or reddit, tik tok isnt worth it. The privacy policy is a human rights violation and the content is largely immature silliness"
Bad. Tik tok takes your info and sells it to the Chinese government I wouldnt download it if you want to keep your info
Good but big problem. This app is a boredom buster but my sisters account and mine has been banned three times When we did nothing wrong All our videos and data is erased for no reason
"Great but. Hi Tiktok I have a little big problem I would like to share. My parents werent happy with me getting the app in the first place because of who owns it they werent sure if my data was being shared with people. I personally love and enjoy using tiktok because the videos on there are amazing and they make me feel happy. But I, on my fyp received the gruesome sucde video and I was VERY disturbed I know this video is being taken down but my parents made me delete tiktok, AGAIN Please can Australia make a new version of tiktok? I feel then more people would use tiktok. I love tiktok like I said but now I wont be able to use it ever again ): Have a great day yalltiktok profile: xxclaradunnexx "
Stealing data. Stealing everyones private data
Best app. I love tiktok.Some how it needs a little fixLike some people are sending information that are bad to lol mid
Good addicting app but steals too much data. I love this app and wish I could still use it but im concerned about the amount of data tik tok farms from your device
"Ok but. I mean TikTok is fine you get to see cool art and stuff like that and creative and funny people, but there is inappropriate stuff on there and TikTok hasnt banned it like people having inappropriate profile pics also I deleted it and I was doing quite well, but I just...didnt feel like my privacy was safe so by TikTok and I know deleting it was a good idea"
"This app is great. It doesnt steal data and its honestly better then the trump 2020 app because the trump 2020 app steals ur info, and its racist"
Unfair environment for creators. The majority of users basically controls tiktok and if they dont like it then they can get anyone on the app removed. Its pandering and its selling out info to China
"Bad. Constant notifications, pedos, censoring BLM, stealing private info"
"Multiple problems with this app. I do not recommend this app AT ALL. It has too much hate speeches, people are misusing the app, TikTok stores all of your data, etc"
I love this app. This is where I get all my information my news about my people all over the world I love this app Thanks . This is my favorite app
In love. I started this in July 2018 and have been told to stop going on this app but Im too addicted though there are some concerns privacy
"The most Toxic App I have been on. This is by far the most toxic application I have ever been on. It started off with watching fun videos and having a good laugh, but as the years went by more and more disturbing content has been popping up. In addition TikTok promotes bullying. Every live you attend there is MASSIVE amounts of bullies and if the Author of the Live doesnt have moderators it gets so bad. In addition Video Replies, those promote bullying The younger generation is not using them right, they will post your comment and expect their little teeny bopper army to start bullying the commentator. You can even say something like wow you look like Madonna and they will hang your comment to have people attack you, its pathetic. Not to mention the break of privacy laws of having your profile photo hanging in someones TikTok being shown to the world. BULLYING AND BREACH OF PRIVACY and use of personal information without permission FIRST CLASS LAWSUIT And lastly I have heard from friends who are parents the application causes severe anger issues in the younger audience, as these short videos flick and trigger negative wave brains. I deleted the app and will never be back and REALLY HOPE TO GOD this app gets a HUGE lawsuit and has to shut down"
It steals your information. Dont download it if yes dont make a account before u post a vid it scares your face and finds your information and they know who u are.They also send ur drafts to a server in China so the Chinese government know ur drafts
Videos are being reviewed. I used to love going on tiktok Lately I\'ve noticed that anything I post is \violating community guidelines\ and is being reviewed Which I don\'t understand as I only use it to post So I can track my progress within my horse riding and seeing what I can work on This app is a very good app until now... I\'m not posting anything that is violating the guidelines
"I am addicted to this its SO good. I first got TikTok because all my friends recommended it to me. Once I got the app I couldnt get off it The sign in is SO quick and it gives you options to how you can sign up which is really helpful. You can also have more than one account so you can have a gaming account and a main account. There are also privacy settings that help kids on the app stay safe. E.g: if someone wants to follow them, then they have to request. And if the kid doesnt want them to, they can click x and decline it. If you havent followed a private account, you cant see their vids which means if you declined an internet troll, then they cant see them and cant comment something mean. It is SO entertaining and fun Its even more helpful now more than ever because of quarantine and being stuck in your house. So I want to say thank you  to the creators for releasing this app and making my life better"
"Take it off the app store (would rate 0 stars). Tik tok a made by a Chinese company who want to steal all your data and sell it. This happens with every app, but a recent study shows that Tik Tok takes up almost 70% more of your data than twitter, instagram, youtube, facebook and reddit. + other apps.For this reason, I believe Tik Tok should be banned. It also has bad censorship software and videos of people shooting themselves and committing suicide can be found"
DONT CHANGE THE PRIVACY SETTINGS. STOP MAKING ACCOUNTS PRIVATE. if the owner of the account want it private then THEY will do it not you. my account is being changed to a private account and no one can save my videos anymore. stop this was my favourite app but now its being annoying and i DONT WANT YOU GUYS CHANGING MY ACCOUNT
"Brilliant stuff. A highly racist app whose regulations need to be regulated. There Is a disgusting and blatant disregard for people of colour, particularly black people. The cavalier way of stealing trends as well as the incessant and unrestricted posting of degrading content should not be tolerated. Not to mention the banning of black lives matter and associated hashtags. If not for your value of human life, then dont download this app because of the extreme data interception and consistent violation of privacy rights"
no safety. spyware on this app is awful download this app and you have just given them every single bit of information you can have digitally also even when the app is closed its still not safe
"amazing . i dont know about you but i absolutely love giving all my information to the chinese government. if youre like me, i would 100% download this app"
tiktok is rubbish. stop spying on us perv
Data farming. People have been discovering that TikTok could be a Chinese company farming your data then I recommend you delete the app and move on
EWWW. REDDIT IS SO MUCH BETTER JUST GET REDDIT INSTEAD BECAUSE TIKTOK GIVES BRAIN CANCER DEVS AND GIV U DATA SENT TO CHINA PLEASE DELETE TGE APP
I miss musicl.ly . I hate TikTok there is so much hate and it keeps logging out of both of my accounts And I cant remember my password. And I get shadow banded for speaking about blm and lgbtq+ TikTok took down my video of me on a one piece swimsuit and it gets taken down for (ViOlAtInG cOmUnItY gUiDe LiNeS) and there is girls wearing thongs and twerking I cant believe it. TikTok steals all your private information and sells it. The maker of TikTok you need to have an explanation for this. Buhbye
The only three things are. There are three problems that I am aware of1# is that TikTok has nothing on2# that I keep on getting band for no reason at all and that I deleted the app at one point because I got band for doing nothing 3# is that it wastes up storage and data
Love it. I dont care if Chinas got my data and info I love this app
"ITS A SECURITY THREAT YEET. THIS APP HACKED MY IPAD, STOLE ALL MY INFORMATION, DELETED ALL MY FILES, DELETED MY APPS, I HAD TO BUY A NEW IPAD JUST BECAUSE OF VERY PIKYPOK, I HATE IT, BYTEDANCE, MORE LIKE BYTACRINGE. U R A WASTE OF MONEY, U HAVE COINS, WHAT AM I MENT 2 DO WITH THEM?"
Dont Download 1312. China is harvesting your Data because they own TicTok BLM things are being censored and they are Shadow banning Poc Creators 0/10
"not worth it unless you want to be spied on. not only did they shadowban #blacklivesmatter which was already reason enough to delete my account, they are constantly spying on you. Pay close attention to what you say, youll find videos and ads tailored to you. Not to mention other peoples camera rolls magically appearing on others phones. Forget it"
Data usage. Im addicted to tiktok watch 12 hrs a day love it
disgusting. you find peoples data and use it
Musically. I love how you can have your own privacy by having a private Account you can change it in Settings
"Privacy settings :|. Its a good app,but as soon as it found out i was 15 suddenly no one can dm me,no one can duet me and no one can stitch me,i understand where your coming from but you should really make it where they can change it if they want because its getting really annoying,not to mention the fact that all my reach is gone "
"Under 16??. I understand this is a privacy thing but I dont want my account to be private. I want others to comment on my videos, duet, stitch and so on. This is probably the worst update so far. Again I get this is a privacy thing but if you want your account private you can do that yourself, I dont need TikTok telling me what needs to be private because Im under 16"
Chinese spys. I know tiktok is addictive but your phone is accessible to the Chinese government who can track your digital footprint but they cover it up by making it a great app
UR SPYING. U CAN SEE WHAT WE DO ON OUR IPAD AND PHONE SO NOOOO 0 STARS
"Dangerous Do Not Use. This application is designed for only one thing, farming information. They collect every piece of information they can get a hold of and then they sell it on to 3rd party companies for money. Very dangerous and 0 privacy"
DONT DOWNLOAD I BEG YOU. This is a chinese spying app and if you agree to privacy policy and stuff they find out where you live google keeps deleting any bad reviews also tiktok is banned in India I beg you dont downloadIf you dont want the Chinese government to find out where you live lets try and ban tiktok
"Love Tiktok For Entertainment, Learning, and Providing Information to the People. This App is the best"
DONT DOWNLOAD. A Chinese parent company owns tik Tok and the app has access to all of your phones storage and by Chinese law they have to give all data to the Chinese communist government
"Its a front for the government to spy on you. If u downfalls this app it gives the Chinese government access to your phone to spy on you,, all the major stars are organic robotoid a enticing you to download out but really its just so the Chinese government can spy on youAfter I downaloded tik tok I posted a photo on imugur and someone with the account name  Chinese government commented  they arent even hiding it"
"Privacy. Even after turning off recommend to contacts, I still was recommended my contacts and they could still see me. My tt is supposed to be an escape"
This Is Whats Making Kids Stay On THERE PHONE ALL DAY. TikTok is the worst app I ever had Its full of degenerates and it lowers attention spans plus its a Chinese app that outright steals information
I loved it until. Tik tok is an amazing app but i do truly think that they should check peoples account or videos that gwt reported first and then ban them if the report was true but sometimes it is false information i got my accounts kieraxofficial and kieraofficialbxckup banned because some girls at achool wanted to get back at me First of all my kieraxofficual was my main account and had tons of videos that are such memorable memories to me and i have had it for atleast 4 or 3 years and yes i know that some creators have had it worse but so have i and tik tok wont give me my data and videos back they keep denying me and on my kieraofficialbxckup i had over 4 thousand followers and it had some of my most viral tik toks and i have i think over 100k likes alltpgether im very sad and all i wajt is my videos back thats it
"AMAZING. TikTok is amazing I love it you have to get it its my favourite app and Im addicted people say it tracks you and isnt safe but I dont believe that I love TikTok. If you are worried about TikTok tracking you, you can have a private account Thx TikTok for creating this awesome app "
"It steals data. I saw that my phones ram usage was unusually high and then when I checked it since it is jailbroken I saw TIKTOK hogging the processor and ram sending data to some other place and when I dug further, I saw it was sending copied things to a location unknown to me hence I deleted it immediately and a few weeks later I saw that people had the same problem I did hence why it was banned in India and was nearly banned in America"
its very good. I love this app you can express your self you dont have to give personal info and you can enjoy others content
Love it. I love this app but for some reason I cant message people on it so it doesnt give me the option to message people on tiktok so if anyone texts me I dont get it and I cant reply back and I checked my settings and it doesnt come up with who can text me in the privacy
DELETE THIS APP PLEASE. It tracks you across everything the reason its addicting is so they can find your up by you using it
Tiktok is a good app but has a lot of space to improve. I personally love tiktok in most ways but the thing I dont like is the community guidelines. There is some stuff on tiktok like people pretending to act kiddish just to play around and they get there vids taken down and some accounts get banned. Plus whenever this happens they are instant to find the problem. This is ok and not too bad but the next part is a problem. Some people are feeling uncomfortable like there is this one tiktoker that does a trend where they transition and there is shirtless babies that duet and smile and it makes her feel uncomfortable. Plus there are TikToks being taken down that arent bad but there is this sound and half of it is breastfeeding. Im not trying to sound like an annoying person but they do it to get popular. And this makes a lot of people feel very uncomfortable and you have to remember the majority of the people on this app are teens. And when they feed they sexualize them like I saw this one where then took their shirt off and just sat there with a baby in the back. This is also bad because this should not be on children app and they dont give the baby privacy to do their business. I have also tried reporting sounds with constant racial slurs and they have not got banned. Tiktok has to take more time to think about the videos like the top and not ban them and ban the ones that cause problems. Like my friend got perm banned because he looked 13 and under even though he was 15. He had 1k followers to waste. Also all of the videos that dont follow guidelines are never banned. Please fix this problem and I would rate it a solid 4.5. But I have just had a very bad experience in these areas of Tiktok. Thank you for reading this passage and if you see this TikTok you have to do something about this. Not everything  has to go online especially if it is personal 
Its ok i guess. Its an amazing app~~~and I really love tiktok and I would never wanna delete it but there is one problem it would be even better if u didnt need to use data for the app especially if u cant afford data (Im just saying) so tiktok I think it would be even better if the app didnt need to use data But otherwise its an AMAZING APP AND I LOVE IT 
"Account details. Hi, Im just going to share my personal thoughts about tiktok in this review. First of all I think the app is awesome but the issue I have and I think its very disappointing is the fact that you have to verify your old number or email to change your new number or email because I have a new number and email and I cant change it so if someone hacks my account then I cant get it back. Please try and do something about it. Thank you for taking your time to read this but I think it needs sorting out"
"Its awful. It collects ur data and watches u when on the app and its terrible, kids get bullied for not having the app, its ridiculous and people are always complaining about the amount of awful disgusting content, call me a Karen but its just terrible"
Do not try this app. It keeps banning me and will not let me log into my accounts and when it says itll give me all my data and never does.DO NOT USE THIS APP
Bad. This app uses way too much data I used like 8GB in 4 days and I barely went on tiktok this is absolutely rubbish and will never use this app again
"Belles review . TikTok has honestly changed my life, its helped me; with all the life hacks, the funny videos on bad days, the awareness videos about important issues, the motivational quotes that seem to be exactly what I need to hear, and I also enjoy making content. I definitely use the app more than any other apps on my phone Which says a lot"
Looove it. My favourite part about this app is how all my data is shipped straight to my favourite commy asian nation
"Info Thieves. They WILL steal all your information when you are offline. They save things even before you saved it. They know whats in your drafts, they send it to a server in China. Disappointed"
"dont get this app. This app is extremely addictive, and ruins your sleep schedule and you will be scrolling for hours Ive wasted days and nights scrolling on this stupid app its the most used on my phone. Dont get this app. People also post really inappropriate content that goes to links, tiktok has took my account down many times and still refuses to take down these extremely inappropriate accounts. This app will waste all of your time"
There spying on you. So it turns out that TikTok is spying on you. if you are reading this delete your account and delete the app
"Steals your life before you know it. Tiktok is designed to be ADDICTIVE. Unless you cant think of anything better to do in your life than scroll on your phone, then yes download tiktok. Otherwise, get your memes and other social media content from somewhere that wont maliciously take away hours of your day at a time"
"Content for everyone. Its incredible and unbelievable that an app has built up a huge community- not only of followers but on creators. You can find things to better yourself, uplift, and inspire"
SUCKS. Steal all your data
"I do not recommend this app. I use to have this app and Im not trying to be mean but Tiktok is very dangerous There is this group called the blue whale and whatever you do and Im warning you now  Stay away from a profile that looks like a strange mouse creature It is not funny this is real Search up blue whale group if you do not believe me And also another reason that I was told by my parents is that people spy on you, on that app and Im not sure if they might know where you live or not... but also I have been seeing very inappropriate content on tiktok like Gacha stuff and all this stuff It just... all has to go and... Im just sad because I had to delete this app and I use to love it so very much but... its just sad how people like this are doing all this stuff Im sorry if this is too long for you to read but who ever took the time to read this I just wanted to thank you very much and, I hope you understand"
"Good. Great app I just hope you guys are not sharing our data to the CCP. Sharing my data to advertisers is all g but to the ccp, hell no"
You steal information of children. Look up their policies
lol its spying. Tiktok is an app for the Chinese people and it spys on people and sell it for cash thats why its banned from America
Read this now. They are spying they read your messages read your clipboard knows your ip and much more
Worst app ever. Wish I could give this app minus star.. hindering users privacy.. stealing data
Sad. I do see good creators on this app but I see more people posting triggering and depressing things. This app is very damaging and has only made my mental health worse. Also lets talk about the privacy. My account got hacked so I deleted it but I cant make another account for a whole month. Im very disappointed and upset by this. Not to mention TikTok will band certain accounts when theyve done nothing wrong but when someone on this app does a very bad thing they dont get banned? Like common
I'm a bit annoyed . So tiktok is great don&#39;t get me wrong but something happened to me two times and I had to remove it and download it again. So it asks me to put my personal information again and when I try it doesn&#39;t let me so I&#39;m very confused to what&#39;s happening it&#39;s very laggy too if this happens again I&#39;ll be deleting it forever I&#39;m so sorry ()
"Privacy and censorship. Even after turning off recommend to contacts, I still was recommended to my contacts and they added me. My tt is supposed to be an escape. They also censor comments when reality makes them uncomfortable"
Tiktok. Just amazing accept the spying through my phone
Chinese. Another Chinese app waiting to steal your information
"voilence. spreading hates,  crimes , hacking the data from phone"
"its great but the privacy options are annoying. so I have a tiktok account, from a long time ago so i forgot the password (should have put it in my notes LOL.) so i needed to change my password but for that i had to change my phone number - which was connected to my old phone - and i cant even change it cos theres a text verification i obviously get that its for security but i cant even change my email too? (i put in a fake email idk why) i logged out before i knew this and i cant log back in. its super annoying too because i cant even watch tiktoks because they freeze on the first frame and dont have any sound - its not even pausedits a great app but i think it could use some more improvements"
RIP security. We dont need the CCP stealing our data. I hope Canada bans it too
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Tik Tok does not care about privacy. I posted something into the my eyes only and got banned for it ( it was for violence im not a weirdo) I also personally believe that their policy is too strict, and airsoft is not something that can be easily posted. Please fix your app"
My review. I  absolutely love this app although Im not very good at it. It helps you express yourself and lets you get to know others but asks for permission first you can put you account private or public and its easy to chose either one. My personal favourite tiktoks are funny ones but I mostly do dancing. So now go enjoy the app
Offline. Go offline so people can use tiktok without wifi or data you just need service
"Not Happy. Over all good app but this morning I went on my phone to realise TikTok was deleted, I re-Download it and log-in, All My private TikToks Have been Deleted I had some very Cherish-able Videos on there With family Members that are no longer here and just overall cherish-able videos"
Spyware. This app is legit spying on people and trying to get away with it. Trash. 
"IS NOT A SAFE APP. TikTok steals ur ID and they dont recognise hackers, this app is dangerous people hack your account and pretend to be you"
WOULD NOT RECCOMEND. this scamming thieving little app has permanently banned me account. it said that i wasnt eligible for tiktok even though i have been using that account for years. i put my age as the year 2000 and it has still got deleted. i would not recommend u download this app as it steals ur information and details
I hate this feature. When ever I tried to switch my accounts it said verify your info because you need to update your acc. Someone told me to uninstall the app and I did the same thing happened and Im stuck with my POV acc because I used my email and my phone the update. Remove this feature now
Information. Need quick information use TikTok find everything
"Spy Tool for the Red Army. Thought this was a great app, until I read Congress&#39; concern how this app is being used to spy on your phone activity even when not in use. And how all this data is being sent back home to the sponsoring country which is the great and friendly government of China"
Die tik tok. This app is cringe trash and Will also track your information
Awesome app. Only thing I dont like is the unnecessary censoring of information
Donald trump made a great choice banning it. Legit cringe. I had cancer attacks more fun than this. I think it gave my brother an aneurism after downloading it and taking a glance at the for you page. And it tracks your information?
Anonymous has cracked down. This app is a way China can get to hacking our personal information. Do not download and do not use this app. They can steal banking information and credit information
Data scam and homophobic. The app constantly takes data from users and blocks people from seeing lgbt creators
"About you changing the guidelines. TikTok why are you forcing people tomorrow to post their faces otherwise they will be banned? Seriously? People are very uncomfortable showing their faces on this app and your gonna FORCE them? We all will be quitting your app if you dont get rid of this guideline. Under 13 people DO NOT want to show their faces, Thats a privacy invasion. Please change this guideline"
"Toxic. Daddy trump is going to get rid of this app  Im so happy trump 2020  Now that I have your attention tik tok shadow bans black creators, lgbtq creators, disabled creators, fa- obese creators, and its making people verified that shouldnt be verified. Also did I mention its trying to steal you information? Yah, not very good. It doesnt just have access to your photos, it has access to your camera, emails, microphone, messages, and search history. It know who you are and who your friends and family are. Its a Chinese spy app along with many other Chinese apps and it should not be downloaded for ANYONE Be carful Do not get this app if you have a secretive job, work for the government, or if youre a child Please take this seriously and think about it"
Tiktok review. This app is very addictive but some people can be quite judgmental or steal your content. But I mean it is the public tho please be careful. Other then that I highly recommend this app
Great app. I think this is A great app just dont steel out information TikTok 
TikTok sucks now. Because so many videos get deleted and do you have to use a wifi network ? Or can you use data too???
What the beach tik tok. It keeps giving me notifications saying to access passwaords and personae information do not download
A stupid app made by people who want to know everything about you. This app is stupid scam made by a Chinese company to take your data if you have more than 1 brain cell dont get it
Eh. Imagine having data privacy from the Chinese  aha
Good app so far but. Good app so far but idk how much you track us yet.. but if I find out that you track us to much Ill be closing my account.. simples and do not sell this to google lol IJS
Stupid app. Dont download Chinese app. Chinese will use your personal information for Malicious purpose. Boycott all Chinese products
great. I really like this app it lets many people WORLDWIDE able to use their creativity in so many different ways however like many people Im concerned with the privacy policies
"DONT USE TIKTOK. If you use this, you are basically supporting China Communist Partys concentration camps, which keep Uyghurs and torture them You are also supporting Organ harvesting done to innocent Chinese Citizens by the government You are also at great risk of China Communist Party leaking and spying on your information and use against you Please AGAIN, if you dont support Torture, Organ Harvesting and possible loss of freedom to Hong Kong or Taiwan PLEASE DONT USE TIKTOK"
"I would recommend it but. Its a really fun app where you can create your own videos make your own music etc but then theres the other side of TikTok the toxic side full of hate. If you hold down on a video theres a couple of options favourite, not interested and more but if you click not interested and couple years later you like that stuff again it will never come back on your fyp unless you make a new account. If I was TikTok I would make a little tab on privacy settings where you can see all the things youve clicked not interested on to bring it back. I know it will never happen tho"
"nice, but. ive had tiktok ever sense it was musically, and ive never had a problem with it, i had an account with many 100 something followers and many videos i was proud of. until, my tiktok account got banned for absolutely no reason at all, i had gotten up to check my phone, i opened tiktok and i was banned for apparently violating the community guild lines, i believe this was a mistake and my account was reported multiple times from a past friend of mine. im very upset about this. but i also tired to download my data, but after i tried to cancel it, it wouldnt let me. it also didnt let me create a new account. please, fix this tiktok"
Dont spy on users. An entertaining video app should not collect that tremendous amount of user data
"Wont let me download?. It keeps saying I need to put in billing info but it declines it, whats up with that"
Spyware app. hey there CCP? You having fun stealing people&#39;s data?
"Issues. This has been getting out of hand. All the accounts Im making are getting permanently banned and I emailed TikTok on the app and 4 times by email, no response. I finally went viral and then it gets permanently banned? No. I dont violate any of the privacy policy or violations of the security guidelines or anything. This is not ok. The account is called @milla.dumbdumb_cooler and Im getting super mad and annoyed at this. I dont find it okay and I want it back now because it wont let me make new accounts anymore"
TikTok. It is a very good app I love the fact that you can be private. It is very good as it has a very wide range of content but if you do get TikTok you will lose track of time and be on for hours
"DONT GET TIK TOK. Tik tok is being banned in countries cause of other countries selling your personal information. Please try not to get, though this app is fun I wouldnt recommend sorry"
"Not recommend. Think, on tiktok you are sharing all your personal information and could be incredibly dangerous for young kids. I dont recommend this app because people add inappropriate content and kids are watching teaching them swear words, teaching them to do inappropriate stuff to them/others and influences kids to do dangerous stuff. The app is addictive so dont start it will waste a lot of your day only watching videos or creating videos, we want kids to stay of technology"
Tic tok is Addicting. This app is so awesome but they need to fix my account and take it off the this child privacy mode
DO NOT INSTALL. THIS APP IS FULL OF PEDOS. TIKTOK ONLY USES YOUR DATA AND SELLS IT TO THE CHINESE GOVERMENT
this app is everything that is wrong with internet today. the amount of censorship is horrible on this app. not only that but the amount of privacy breaches is terrifying. Also its an extremely racist app. it also boosts predators to the fyp etc. absolute trash
Sad because of this. I gave the app a four star review because i saw these tik toks that say this doll will hunt you at 3am and people are using god for clout but otherwise this app is amazing :))) EDIT: IT IS TERRIBLE YOUR PERSONAL INFO GETS SENT TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT YOU ARE NOT SAFE IMA TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO DELETE BECAUSE THEY POST EVERY DAY
Amazing. It is great you can choose different privacy settings and everyones is different
. Thanks for taking my info and selling it to the government through my email and phone number
Good but. Okay this app is really great but...is it true that you are taking our information and data? Are you saving our drafts and sending them to China? You are over worrying all of us and we would love to have a response. Please keep this app a safe place for us all. You are losing fans of this app and its sad
"Do not install:&;&/&&;$/&@@;&&. All of your data goes to the Chinese government, and that is actual fact that you can go research. The us military literally labeled it a cyber threat. Its very open about that fact that it literally tracks everything you do, your location, what you say, what you search on other apps, what you purchase, everything. Do not download, terrible for mental health as well, it will lower your attention span and make you stupid. Yes it is addicting and hard to get off of it and thats why you should not get it. You should not download it, and if you are a parent you shouldnt allow your kids to download it. Not to mention its full of underaged children and pedophiles. Do not install"
TikTok bad thing. The thing is They save your draft and send them away and go through your personal details such as contacts and emails so that why its very unsafe
"so many reasons. tiktok promotes body shaming, suicide, self harm, drugs, and dangerous trends. tiktok is harvesting our data through this app too. but mainly 1 star because this app is terrible"
"Data Stealing. Do not download, as they have been exposed as selling data to alibaba servers"
Steal. does this app can send my personal information to China?
Garbage. This app is trash it steals your information and sends it to the Chinese government and promotes sexuality to your children DO NOT And I mean DO NOT Download this app its awful
Tracking my data. Finally Deleted
"Awful. This app is already being banned in some countries . It spies on you and collects your data. Delete this awful app now. I am begging the appstore, cancel this app from all iOS devices"
Yes but. Concerns about it being on my phone e and what information is being accessed and sold or used by who??
"Tik tok steals your identity. Tik tok even Saïd themselves that they steal all your data , location , everything about you is taken and sent to the Chinese government and the Chinese communist party wants to take over the world, 10/10 recommend deleting it before your identity is stolen"
"good just extremely shady. So, first of all, tiktok is a good app if you were a viner or a musically user just, it is extremely shady. They covered up a person going die on stream and called their friggin pr team before paramedics or police. So, if you are ok with a shady app that may or may not spy on you, go for it"
"TikTok. TikTok is a good app but on some phones or iPads or whatever it wont let you update it so if TikTok reads this I would like to know how to update this app, however it is sometimes a very dangerous app because people could get to know your personal details and if your account is not on private everyone can see it and get to know where you are"
Gives all your data to the Chinese communist party. Grrrreat
Bad steals information. It steals and sells your information took my credit card info linked to email and deleted my other review saying that they sell your information also very cringe and lots of stupid copyrighted songs
Re-think your need to download this app. This app is literally spyware. It sends the data to a one-party state which has a president for life and runs concentration camps
Chinese malware. This application has been thoroughly searched and concluded as being suspiciously stealing our data and our information for other uses
Great  but. This app is amazing I love you can make privet account text friends comment on vids share but ....... my mum saw this thing on Facebook and it said something about looking through personal stuff like texts images I didnt wanna believe it honesty I loved the ago I felt just dumb I dunno just be careful I love this app but Im not sure sorry TikTok I love you its amazing I just people look through my stuff.anyway there something about China to do with it I havent got a clue . Its kinda like talking Angela but people adore TikTok and theres no murder .thankfully. And like all social medias you half to be a setern age Im just worried about it so I dont want it to get any worse then it is because I install it again but dont think I will
So much stolen content and inappropriate. Never download garbage
"deleting reviews. this app is spyware, it sells ALL your information, they also deleted reviews when people exposed their racism"
Communist spying tool. Warning: this app is for spying on you by the Chinese Communist Party Deleting this app right away
Warning. US government officials arent allowed to have this application downloaded because it is supposedly a way for the Chinese government to spy on millions of people. Save yourself
Entertaining. Its a great app for information an sharing information
Amazing Im obsessed. This app is amazing I think Im a bit obsessed this app has a great privacy policy and you can make your account private or not. When you first get the app you can decide on what you like. There are lots of dances to do and make. If there isnt a dance on their you can make your own sound for it. You can do pranks.  And if you get over 1000followers you can go live what means you can talk to your fans on TikTok also I have noticed that every celebrity is on tiktok I really recommend 
Disgusting. Not a bad idea for an app. Only if there arent spies monitoring your every post.Down with the CCP
Interesting app. Good way to share information
"Spyware. Simple as that, selling data just as bad as Facebook if not worse, because instead of being run by a lizard like Facebook, its run by a bunch of incompetent people who think that ugly or disabled people dont belong on the front page"
DO NOT DOWNLOAD I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS. This app tracks everything you do and basically stalks you. I deleted it and its boring now that everyone is being cancelled and shaded and stuff like that. Its toxic and ruins lives. It literally watched you make videos and its terrible. DONT DOWNLOAD
"Great to send info to the Chinese government. I really like this app because sending private information to the Chinese government is my hobby , if u like sending all ur private information to the Chinese government then this is the app for u"
its a scary app. stop spying on users of tiktok 
"DONT DOWNLOAD. Tik tok is tracking where you are because when I swiped up the app there was a notification every time that said at home so it knows where my home is. Its toxic and dangerous, someone live-streamed themselves committing suicide and tik tok kept this from the users. If you dont believe me, search it up but whatever you do, dont. download. the. app"
Biggest Liar. Steals data from your device
Chinese. Stop taking my data and selling it to people for profit you corrupted organisation
Amazing. I am sooo obsessed with this app its so good it has amazing content but it has all of your information and sends it
DELETE TIK TOK. There&#39;s Chinese spyware in Tik Tok. They can take your data and sell it for loads of money. It&#39;s already banned in India and getting banned in the US. It&#39;s getting banned for your safety. Don&#39;t be mad if it does get banned. Delete this app NOW
"Utterly terrible. It literally takes all conceivable info you could possibly imagine. Shady, cringe and annoying app that makes me lose faith in our dying culture. If you use this app, be ashamed of yourself"
"Spying Chinese government?. Chinese government used this app for stealing your information, and this is horrible beacause though they dont why would they make an app like this? Lets all get this aPp banned"
"updates. I loved tik tok before these updates, why does everyone need to see what I comment on other peoples videos or whos accounts I look at? Extremly annoying and lack of privacy. Almost makes me want to delete tik tok all together"
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. tiktok can get addicting, its very toxic, but the worst thing is that it tracks you. Collects all your info, all your photos, and even when your not on the app it still takes it. Musically was better"
Rating and Opinion. Its a very good app but just wished we could use it without data
Bad. There is terrible privacy
Downfall of humanity. A data collection service thinly disguised as a social media platform. Steals all you data with the promise of fame
creeps on app. didnt this app get fined for stealing underage users data
"Tiktok. The app is good, the the people who own it arent. China is taking data from people, and because of that, the app is now getting banned in Australia"
"I love this app. Its more personal than Twitter, Instagram or Facebook for me. The algorithm has me right where I belong, to the point I have a hard time going to do something else "
"DONT DOWNLOAD. This app is so weird One day I was making a tiktok and I didnt post it I saved it to my drafts and it posted on its own and saved to my camera roll, plus China is taking peoples info from this app and tracking them... I know it looks like a lot of fun but please take this review in mind if you download it"
"Its okay. The app itself is okay. Its very toxic and hateful so if you cant take a bit of hate this is not the app for you. There are some really caring, nice, and talented people on there. But its mostly stupid. Its actually really entertaining but it can be addicting. There have also been a lot of reports that TikTok isnt safe and it steals your data, knows were you live, etc. Overall I like the app but its not meant for everyone"
Tik tok more like sh#t tok (MUST READ FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY). I frickin hate this app the Chinese use it to spy on us and its F#CKING VINE How have they not sued you yet Im so glad sh#t tok is getting banned in Australia itll get rid of the plague that is sh#t tok its cringe it steals your data the apps on your phone/iPad the apps on it your phone number IP address where you live what you search and to add insult to injury they put your info on a F#CKING UNPROTECTED PROXY SERVER so if someone gets in and it gonna be F#CKING EASY say goodbye to your info no more PayPal no credit card everything could be stolen from HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF F#CKING PEOPLE AND GUESS WHAT ALL THAT IS WORTH 10000s OF DOLLARS SO YEAH SOMEONE GONNA WANT TO HACK INTO THAT SOMEONE LITERALLY REVERSE ENGINEERED IT AND ALL OF THIS IS TRUE WATCH OPTIMUSES VIDEO YOULL SEE AND I CANT GO ONE F#CKING DAY WITHOUT A MENTION/VIDEO OF SH#T TOK AND I ONLY DOWNLOADED IT TO WRITE THIS SO PEOPLE CANT GO THROUGH THE SH#T HOLE THAT IS SH#T TOK AND TO PROTECT THEM FROM GETTING F#CKING HACKED.TL:DR DONT USE SH#T TOK ITLL STEAL YOUR INFORMATION AND STORE IT ON A UNPROTECTED SERVER AND SOMEONE CAN EASILLY STEAL YOUR INFORMATION
new tiktok update . the new tiktok update is so bad. People cant get on the fyp without showing their face or recording something off of there. Havent you thought how people are very careful with their privacy so they dont show their face? The entertainment on my fyp has definitely died down since the new update. I cant post anything without it getting low views because of this and usually i get 1k+ views. Please remove this update
"Whats the point. This app is horrible, its ruined peoples stability and mental health. Thanks to addictions, I'm on this app 24/7. Its ruined my mental health and appearance. Another thing is that this app is racist and will take down videos of LGBTQIA+ videos, black awareness videos and overall.. banning kids with Roblox accounts, fortnite accounts, etc.  There is also a lot of errors with this app for example, following to fast take a break my fingers aren't gonna fall of tiktok, and it is an invasion of privacy, this app tracks your location at certain points and some creators stalk your page. There are also creeps on this app that pretend to be kids or at least your age who are really 60 year old people.  It is also disgusting how people body shame others or make fun of there appearance on this app, it doesnt make you cool or funny. I personally think ages 12-13 is to young for this app considering how ugly it has gotten, there is literally 10 year olds on this app who sometimes need to witness the horrible comments and stuff on this app. If you do ever consider getting this app or allowing your child to download this app, please be very cautious about what I have spoken of and other authorities and please tell your child and yourself that its okay and not to listen to any bad and weird things people are commenting about you or your appearance and please just be yourself and don't let this ruin your mental state. Dont say I didn't warn you"
"DELEATE TIK TOK. Tik tok - make your day , more like  Tik tok - steal your private information. DO NOT GET THIS APP Some people may believe me, some may not, but I dont care. You dont have to believe me. Im just saying this so people wont get this app. Its useless"
"Great algorithm, shame about all the data security issues. Also dont love that I have to make an account to use the app"
Master of time wasting. Went over my data of 25 GB this month because i used 12 GB just on tiktok. Yall wanna pay my bill overage??
Change the update. I really dont like this new update. It shows the messages first then I have to tap it and go to activity can you change it I hate this update. And also can you add who view your profile option I need to know whos viewing my profile for my privacy. Thank you
"Gathers personal data for Chinese communist party. This stupid app collects data like location, microphone, contacts, camera so this app could very well be a database collector for Chinese communists to spy on you or who knows what else. DONT DOWNLOAD"
Banned. I love TikTok overall its a great app. But I have had to make multiple accounts due to the fact that I keep getting banned without doing anything. Like I had 0 videos and had not said anything bad on anyones videos but TikTok decided to ban me. And I cant even download my data. So Im mad about that
"Get this to the top so tiktok sees my false ban. Hello, my account called 24koof was recently banned for being under age, this is not true this account is owned by me, I am the older brother of Ethan, I am the rightful owner and creator of this account, and I am 19 years old, my little brother takes my phone with my permission to use it and makes tiktoks on it for fun, I respect your privacy problems and your prospective but this account does not only affect Ethan, but myself I hope we can all come to an agreement and unban this account. Thank you for your time"
It\'s hacked. They are trying to hack into all your information and they are watching though your screen
"BANNED ME FOR NO REASON. yall banned me for no reason, not a good app, like, I didnt do anything wrong, I followed your privacy policies you shouldnt ban people like that, very toxic, please learn to not ban other people becuase it does break their heart when they get banned for no reason.Thank yiu for nothing"
Kiss goodbye your privacy. And say hello to being put on a list scrolling through this app
"Not good. Content is not good, and then it is china based app. You cannot trust this app, it might be giving away ur data"
China will steal your information POG. Tik tok is run by a Chinese company and therefore China can steal your information and use it bad things . I hope you die from a nuke if you download tiktok because that will be pog and I will hit the floss on your dead body and spend all my vbucks to help for 9/11 2.0 then f your mum
DO NOT DOWNLOAD I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD. This app tracks everything you do and basically stalks you. I deleted it and its boring now that everyone is being cancelled and shaded and stuff like that. Its toxic and ruins lives. It literally watched you make videos and its terrible. DONT DOWNLOAD
Bad app. TikTok gave my information out to strangers and I kept getting videos about people raping others as a joke
Spyware. So sad that so many people give Bytedance their videos and personal info. It only makes the AI smarter. Please Microsoft buy Tiktok
Spyware app. Dont let your child using this app because it is dangerous and data collection for state own app This is not a private company
"Lack of good customer service. The account got locked out even tho I already registered already the account now removed still the customer service is still not able to help out with my inquiries to recover the lost account 0 star for app if this app  have a update to recover the lost and removed account by returning all the lost data uploaded videos with it, i will amend my reviews to 5 stars for now is 0 star for lack of customer service to deal with my inquiries"
"My personal view on TikTok. This app has allowed me to push my art out to the public and bring forward bigger, brighter personalities to the community"
Horrible app. They steal your information and also dont support multi racial users this app should be deleted #tiktokover2020
"My review of TikTok. It is easy to use, lots of fun and makes me laugh constantly. Also perfect to express yourself as well as being good for friendship communication. If u r worried about anybody seeing ur account be aware you an add a privacy setting making ur account only visible to people who u have authorised to.i would recommend TikTok to anyone so I would suggest u download the app today  There r lots of creators waiting for you.xxxx"
Trash App. First they will take your data and send it to china without inform you. Then they will sell your data in dark webfor just $10-20. So install this app on your own risk. My job was to inform you
App gone sexual. Too many 18+ stuff and it takes my data
Chinese Spyware. Do not download this app as the Chinese Governments can track everything on your phone
"TikTok. It is a good app but watch out, if you have an iPhone (as far as i know) the documents and data will eat up your storage. I have 64gb and 17gb of those were used up for tiktok, you can check how much tiktok takes up for you by going to settings, general, iPhone storage then scroll down and look for tiktok and press it then look at the documents and data column. I dont know whether it is just me who has experienced this or if it happens for everyone but ive recently deleted tiktok for the reason that im not going to waste 17gb of storage for an app. i have no idea why it takes up so much and it seems to gradually build up over time. be careful"
Terrible. Only unfunny white chics and soyboys use this app And its pretty much a data farm with the mask of a social media
Banned. Tik Tok was fined 5.7million USD for collecting data on children. If I had an application in the App Store and got caught with this serious offence the application wouldnt be removed. Why is Tik Tok still allowed to after their criminal application in the Apple App Store  If you have kids you cant let them use an application that collects data such as email address and location. If they are capable of going after your children what else are they doing ? Just something to think about
Dont download. No thanks I would rather keep my data
TikTok IMPORTANT. TikTok I love watching the tiktoks but I think that you are stealing a lot of my information and It is not ok so please stop
"No. This app sends information to people, and I think thats NOT how these apps should work. I think this app should be taken down"
I thought this was good. Stealing our data huh? Wow
TikTok. Really love the app but Im worried about the spying thing just in case. From Cayayayaua
"@search_up_this. We all love tiktok, and if people are stealing our information so be it We all love having tiktok as a part of our day, please dont ban it in Australia "
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD . I have had TikTok for awhile, and it was fine. Then, I got a new phone. I noticed that even if I wasnt recording my camera and mic. was on. Secondly, this app is very inappropriate and racist"
. Stop collecting peoples data
. I love u tiktok  I dont even care if you steal all my data 
Good app. If kids wanna watch it there is a restricted mode thats a clean showing it is all I havent got any of my personal data stolen and its just a lie
"Dont download. The amount of bs on this app is insane, theres lots of pedos and the Chinese use it to spy on people. For the sake of your own privacy dont download"
????. Hi I personally love tiktok I heard it steals ur data tho is it tru??
Chinese data mine. Please think twice about this Chinese government sponsored app
Data. Good way to waste all my free time
Essentially malware. App takes far too much information
"I  absolutely LOVE tiktok. The only reason is that anyone could follow you and look at your information, so I HIGHLY recommend using a private account.But overall Tiktok is great"
"Its Great. Just Please dont sensor those who are speaking Truth Tik Tok community often feel silenced and censored for sharing information, facts and Data, especially right now regarding the Covid virus and vaccines; Information people don't get on the mainstream media news"
Invasion of privacy. Chinese spying device
Good but. This app is amazing and I loved it so much there just one little problem It TRACKS YOU INFORMATION And when you delete the app it still emails you
"Spying. Ok so this app is so addicting to watch and make tik toks but, they take ur information and they send it to China to spy on us so careful"
Worst app ever. Never use it. They breach your privacy data. #Chinesevirus
Disgusting. Not a bad idea for an app. Only if there arent spies monitoring your ever post.Down with the CCP
UNINSALL. THEY SPY ON YOU LOOK THROUGH YOUR CONTACTS AND TRACK WHERE YOU ARE HARVEST YOUR DATA PLEASE UNINSTALL
"Its great. The title and rating was but a ruseChna uses this app to collect private data It also deeleeted a bunch of bad revyews to go from their true 2 star rating to 4Remember Anonymous, they warned us about this"
"Dark Secrets. It is really good and has a lot of amazing features, but they spy on you and your phone and see what you are doing. You said you want to make things better for users and I says STOP THIS, unacceptable behaviour and I cant believe you are doing this no one will want TikTok. China stop this stop spying people stop seeing their texts stop seeing their search history stop seeing their photos, STOP"
"Great app. This app is amazing, funny yet safe and there are so many options like privacy settings and much more. Also you can:add friends, like videos, comment on videos, use all sounds and songs, make your own sound and use it, use other peoples sounds, DM people, follow people, if someone follows you you can follow them back to be friends, you can turn your account private so people have to send a follow request and you can turn you account friends only so they have to request to follow you and you have to follow them back for them to see your tik toks"
Tiktok sells ur info. Tiktok is a way where China sells ur information for money
Sppying app. This app takes control of your phone data and sends it to China
"Brilliant App. Seriously this is a really fun appDONT FALL INTO THIS TRAPIt may look innocent at first, but Apple caught them illegally smuggling peoples data out of their phones while beta testing iOS 14 and its new warning feature that warns you when apps are taking data from your phone.Dont believe me? Look it up. TikTok purposefully got rid of their 1 star ratings from India because the government and people knew what the corporation is up to. Since then, India has since banned the app in their country. It breaks privacy laws, and psycho parents can now track their children that they had previously lost custody from, or foreign governments can get sufficient data from your location and even kidnap you if youre deemed too smart, or a potential threat later on. Being Tiktok famous isnt worth it, youre being remembered for doing a dance people can only cringe at in the future. If you want a similar app that is more secure, then check out Byte (By the same people who made Vine), or go back to Musical.ly, both are far safer than this horrible app"
"Ok. I like TikTok, its just they are always trying to figure out personal info such as date of birth"
"Data . It wastes your data a bit but after I&#39;ve been watching it for 4 hours a day you get use to it, you may find that it starts getting boring but like the videos that you like so your FYP stays sutitable for you "
"Scammers. I find that this app has a lot of scammers using other peoples photos, Then send emails then want you to join on hangout and from there they try to continue their scamming, be smart peopleDont give out any personal information about your self or anyone else"
Spys. This app lets the Chinese government spy on you
Addictive. Love the app. Dont love the substantial & invasive privacy violations but hey whats a little privacy violation by communists who hate us? Oh wait. .
Lovely tbh thx 4 respecting privacy. TBHHHH 
"Fucking dreadful. Do you want the ccp to spy on you? If so, this is the app for you"
"Teen privacy policy. The teen privacy policy should be optional and not forced on teens because it is quite annoying and restricts things that I could do before. The update made it so that I cant share tik toks via direct messages and my friends cant comment who could comment before, I need to follow them back In order for them to comment but sometimes I miss people who follow me and forget to follow them back. Not every teen is irresponsible on the internet, so forcing every teen ages 13-15 without the ability to turn the privacy settings set by tik tok off until theyre 16 or older is not right. I think you guys are overdoing the privacy policy by restricting messages AND comments from other people. I get that a privacy policy is essential to keep the younger audience safe but it takes away the freedom of being to talk and socialize to other people on the app. I think a good idea would be to set the tik tok teen privacy settings by default but allow them to still be changed with the addition of a warning of possible things that could harm them if they arent careful with who the talk to online"
Not safe. It steals a lot of personal data and other things. Please do not use this app it is a dangerous app. It is even banned in some countries due to privacy concerns like india. Not a safe app to use at all
"Restart Report System. Its literally a toxic wasteland in tiktok no matter the community you join but telling strangers to unalive themselves simply because they cant just scroll IS AND SHOULD BE A VIOLATION. Im tired of it NOT being one. And theres even videos of doxxing and its not against violation when its literally private info like dead names. If you are going to allow that, then allow stoners to vibe and not get strikes by violations for literally just existing, especially transition videos because going through a transition is exhausting. Dont ignore us trans and say its gross. We deserve a platform too"
"The Life Saver. In all honesty I used to make fun of people who were old and using tic tok, I became curious and I downloaded it, I soon began to understand that even though its a social media platform its also a place where you can be yourself, you can be a target you can be a comedian but most of all it can be a way to escape reality, sure you get nasty comments but in my personal experience I posted a video without intention of being viral and the support you can get from people all over the world and the relationship you build is amazing, I fell on hard times and I used tictok to express my emotions and iv connected to so many people over the world in the same position. I would like to thank the creators of this app for aiding in my call for help. Please dont shut down this app"
This app is annoying get rid of this update. I dont want to be a private account
Takes data do not get. Using are data to find stuff about us China is bad and I got suspicious when it said good morning Dylan to me then I deleted it never get it if you trust your data being taken
Its bad its hack my data. Its bad app I m not prifer this app delete it
IT UNSAFE. THIS IS AN UPDATED COMMENT IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT THEY ARE USING THIS APP TO SPY WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD
Trust me china is hacking your information. All your detail plus from your phone valuable data are hacked by Chinese government
Lives. Terrible app. Make it so I can turn off these random lives on my fyp and never get all the spam notifications of when accounts I follow go live
TikTok is bad. TikTok recently asks if you use Twitter to like delete post unlike tweets ON YOUR BEHALF if you value your freedom and privacy steer clear of this shady commie CCP app
"Tiktok is unethical. EditOn February 27, 2019, the FTC fined TikTok Inc.US$5.7 million for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act in the United States"
"Thank you TIKTOK. IM LOVING TIKTOK & ITS GIVEN ME INCREDIBLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES The only thing I would change is the community guideline violation history. It makes no sense why after having appealed the violation and having you video restored, the violation still stays on your record & then increases your risk or being restricted or banned. I think this is the one thing holding TikTok back but its a great app overall"
I-. Download this app to have all tour personal data send to the Chinese Whats not to like?
Spying on my info. They found out my fetish
"Do not download because of your safety. This review is not for just because its horrible but because this is a Chinese spying app,it can take pictures of you and then it can use all of your camera pictures to spy on you,So again,DO NOT DOWNLOADplease tell everybody you know about this"
Invasion of privacy. This is one of the arm of Chinese government to intrude your privacy. Absolutely dangerous
Chinese Propaganda and data collecting App. Warning: Download with extreme caution
"Hi Im Scarlett. TikTok is a fun app and just because someone died on it doesnt mean you shouldnt get it. I mean China might be spying on you but hey,its worth it right? Go follow me on TikTok at: thatmessyouknow (the info of account says its ya girl Scarlett bla bla bla okay bye"
"TikTok #1 most personal data mining app. Hey, congrats on the honor of TikTok #1 most personal data mining app. App Deleted - Not cool"
"Dont download. Nothing more than a waste of time and nothing much to see, dont waste your time down the drain watching millions of short clips made by talentless and not funny people. Also, the Chinese government may be spying on you"
Banned my art account. They banned my art account after 3 years of work. My account name was @vibrantviper and without notice they removed everything and I couldnt retrieve any of the data even after requesting it. Heartbroken
Steals data.             ?
TikTok. I really enjoy it . This is my most used app on my phone. You can make your own TikTok and see your friends. Also you get to see peoples TikTok all around the world. You can be private
". Kids,If your using this app be careful it can release your data to anyone Other than that the game is fun"
"Rubish. And collecting data , location , password, bank cards , everything"
"TikTok is a Chinese data mining site. The Chinese gov uses this site to mine data from foreign citizens. It frequently infringes on the privacy rights of children, the unwilling and the disabled. This hellsite should under no circumstances be used. There are alternatives"
Communism. Look I know whats happening here you guys are spying on us right?Ever think why your posts are more popular than any other social media? Well because they give you followers and likes They drag you in and steal your informationIts like mini data breaches on every accountIf you dont know what a data breach is its where hackers hack a popular site and get every email registered to it 1. Every password on every other site to be sold (takes a while your info can be stolen for anything any second now)2.Your IP address 3. Where you live4. Remote access to your webcams with keyloggers (blackmail)5. And moreThis is whats happening on tik tok and your privacy is not safe.Please please PLEASE delete it Countries are slowly banning it like Australia America India (for different reasons) Do NOT let these commies target your personal info This comment is for the glory of effort riches and gratitude these things will NOT be found in communism
Careful with this. Chinas government at work collecting your data
"Do not support this app. Data thieving, racist, discriminative owners. Do not support this app"
"banned me??. if I could give a 0 I would. I did nothing wrong, went against no guidelines but I was permanently banned with over 100 followers. Tiktok wont give me my data or even tell me why they banned me. its ridiculous. dont get me wrong its a fun app, but banning me for no reason isnt okay"
Do not get it. If you get Tick Tock the Chinese government&#39;s company can mind your data
Most annoying app on planet. Ruining the future generation. Politically modivated app suspected fo stealing personal data. DO NOT DOWNLOAD
. tiktok is not at its peak right nowplease prevent the tracking devices and scams that are going aroundty &lt;3
Im done with information taken away. Im done with the information your stealing from me I dont want corona all over my passwords and usernames
What they should do cause its annoying me. BRING BACK THE OLD TIKTOK but it not to be rude And also make tiktok have no data
I love it but. I love Tiktok but it keeps banning from live streaming because it says Im underage when Im not Im 12 unless theres a certain age you have to be to live stream that I dont know about then.. JUST STOP BANNING ME if Tiktok replies can you unban me from live Im 12 but I didnt put my actual bday when I signed up bc I thought you would take my personal info so I put a fake bday sorry
"Eh. An okay app however the reporting system is very broken.Peoples videos will get taken down for talking about slightly political things or their opinions that are unpopular among some people,but when you report videos for people showing triggering, fresh, scabbed self h*rm marks or report people for using slurs (even though tic tok says when you submit a report that videos containing that will be taken down) they are never taken down and you just get told it doesnt violate community guidelines when it very clearly does. It is also very annoying that there is no phone number to call to talk to an actual person to workout problems or complain and it is very hard to find an email and they only have an email to be contacted by for very few specific things.Also apparently they are secretly stealing your informations and things life your private drafts have been downloaded to a server in China"
creators vids keep getting taken down. ^^ thats allall they need to do is make their privacy policy like instagrams then its the best app
"Chinese Spyware. It gives your data to the ccp. Its not worth it, all it is a ton of rich white girls creating cringe"
"upset user. I really loved the tiktok app and for some reason I got banned just by a couple of reports, the review would have been higher but Ive done absolutely nothing wrong and my account got banned for community guidelines yet Ive done nothing against it, the person that had reported me actually was pretending to be someone and sharing personal information and showing their faces without permission. However I got banned instead from a couple of reports. I really loved using the app but now because of this its low, my tiktok user is @ chloe.is.swaggyyy I just needed to know if I could ever get my account back"
"Evil and owned by creeps. Do NOT install people the point of the app is so that the Chinese government can see ur personal info, ur search history, ur games and apps, looks through ur camera 24/7, records everything u say, and the Chinese government keeps all this info"
"I LOVE THIS APP. If u dont have tiktok, u should TOTALLY GET IT Its how people get to know others, get popular, can do giveaways, give advice, crafts and WAY MORE cool things If u arent comfortable with people u dont know looking at ur videos, there is a setting that u could go private so only the people u follow can see ur videos This app has helped from  how do u get water out of ur phone after dropping it into the toilet to how do u make a homemade whipped coffee People also do dances and there are MANY turtorials This is why All people 13-or older should have tiktok"
DO NOT DOWNLOAD I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app tracks everything you do and basically stalks you. I deleted it and its boring now that everyone is being cancelled and shaded and stuff like that. Its toxic and ruins lives. It literally watched you make videos and its terrible. DONT DOWNLOAD
"I had 30k followers and You just ban my account for no reason. As many of the  creators lost their accounts because tiktok got glitched and was asking for our age every 30 seconds. Ive Selected the wrong age by mistake, then suddenly losing my account and you dont answer to the emails or messages. Thats my business you should care as a big company as you are, its a shame. You cant just ban people immediately when they tap something wrong. I understand the privacy but At least you should warn before do this automatically.Will I get back my profile ?Username: sotospapp"
"Tiktok is the Best Social Media App. At first, i was hesitant to try TikTok for they said its all for kids and teenagers. As I tried it for weeks, I see Gen X guys that are here as well. I stayed longer until I was hooked, posting 2-4 posts per day. Thats different given my frequency in other SM are just 3 times a week. Thats weak Why its 2-4 posts a day is because of the solid tools inside TikTok itself. Creating the video is a breeze where I dont need much of a 3rd party video and audio editor. Everything is intact to one platform. I can create beautiful semi-viral video is less than 10 mins. Totally different from other platforms. Adding music is so easy that you can choose a lot of 15-minute to a minute of songs. There are different genre for my generation and the millennials. Those are not just music but are cool music too Though short ones but concise. I can use it in any form I like. Like me, i use other softwares just to mix my video and audio to a song. It takes an hour or so to finish. But, I can do it in TikTok for less than 5 minutes. Few clicks and removing my original audio an thats it, so convenient. Text. Oh men, I really like it I can integrate text on my videos in just minutes. I can set the duration so easily when I want to appear on my video at the exact moment. I hope TikTok will add more fonts to it. But this time, its fine. Hashtags are really helpful and accessible. So easy that it will provide me the hottest trend. It really saves time for me, saving time for my brain cells to think about hashtag words. This is really different in a good way. Viewership is incredible. I cant believe how I got more viewership than any other platforms I use. This is surprisingly good. And response interface are so easy, like double click likes. It saves time for my viewers to do it. Watching people dance, sing, doing comedy, and more is a totally a different experience. Swiping up will give me such an abundant entertainment in a quick timeframe. Saving time for people who really needs the time for work or study. Theres no wonder why there are many people coming in and using TikTok. This app is not only for entertainment but for saving a lot of time for everyone to get the best contents in a one minute max. I really like this app and sure to be recommended to others. Thanks TikTok for creating a superb platform for us to use"

"So much more then just an app. I have been on TikTok for years and the way it has developed has been amazing I have changed so much since on TikTok my entire playlist is from TikTok I have changed my style and I have made som friends. The support on the app is incredible, virtually everyone stands up to homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexists and has made me feel so great about myself I cant thank TikTok enough for the way its changed my life. Its so much more then just an app"
"Terrible. Absolutely dreadful app it is cringy, disgusting and it gives your data to foreign governments"
They stole all my data and personal information and gave it to the CCP. They stole all my personal data and information and gave it to the Chinese aCommunist Party
Spyware app. Dont let your child using this app because it is dangerous and data collection for state own app This is not a private company because CCP owns you
Dont download. Tik tok takes your data info and shares it with the Chinese Communist Party. This is their law
"Benefits & Not so much. I bow to all content creators for sharing themselves with the world. Energetic and brave producers put their knowledge, talent, creativity, emotions and vulnerability into their content. Educational, entertaining and I cant believe you said that. Retired and living alone, hearing what people have to say on TikTok, gives a sense of connection to whats going on with real people that otherwise I would have no contact with. On the down side there are liars, pretenders and advertisers that want your attention. And trolls who are compelled to take their bad feelings out on everyone with criticizing comments, while hiding behind anonymity like the cowards they are. I learned more about myself from medical professional and people with the same maladies sharing their personal experiences on TikTok, than I did over 70 years of living and seeking help for what ails me. In a sentence, TikTok has made my life better. However, would I prefer in person contact with people. Of course"
Literally the best app ever. This app is absolutely incredible definitely the best social media rap this is because it is for one very addictive. I could spend hours scrolling through TikTok. If you make an account you can make your own videos too. you can do really imaginative content. for example you can be a fairy. or you could just make an account for fun Overall I think this is a friendly community.The majority of people support each other. of course there will be haters but thats with every social media app. I like how you can have a private account and your public account
IMPORTANT INFO. Amazing app just keep it on restricted mode or the Chinese that run the app will watch what u do on ure phone so be careful
Tik tok. TikTok is owned by China and China get ur data through this app
". I was banned and wrote an appeal because they dident even tell me why I was banned, and I made a new account and they did not let me download my data. Bad app and racist because I posted a tik tok of my dad dancing who is black and they banned me"
Steals information. It has bad words in it too
"What is happening. The reporting has to change please. People who do not violate any guidelines get videos removed because people just report videos to be mean, while other videos that CLEARLY violate community guidelines stay up because the person is good looking. Its almost as if the people reviewing videos are biased and are not going by what violates guidelines but what they like and dont like. Its Community Guidelines for us and Personal Preferences and Bias Guidelines for Tiktok employeesAlso the not interested  and the hide videos from this user buttons do not work. Most times my foryou page is a lot of people i follow which basically makes 2 following pages so I will select hid videos from this user then what actually happens is the app shows me even more of that user on my fyp instead of less or none"
"TikTok experience an opinion. It makes my soul happy Im able to be myself. Be silly yet Phill outgoing continue to be an introvert. But the downfall is it takes a lot of data and storage in my phone.. and for some reason I cant do video gifts not live video gifts regular video gifts and I have way more followers than another girl and shes able to do it but it tells me I have to have 100,000. If that can be checked on that would be great. As well as people get on live suspension for no reason just because somebody else claimed false information about the live"
New Update. I love TikTok its really fun but on the new TikTok it doesnt let you download your own videos or change the privacy settings. I find this rather annoying since I have some old videos that id like to delete
Awful company. They sell all data about you to the Chinese government
"Account hacked. I really liked this app, and I have had it since musically, but I was on TikTok yesterday and I went to change accounts, as I have two, and it signed me out I went to log in and it said there was a problem with the server. This morning I have gone back on the app, and tried to sign in, but it says my passwords are wrong, then it says that I am using your services too frequently. I am very upset about this and will never be downloading this app again. Its not the fact that it wont let me sign in though, but if my account is hacked, I dont want people seeing my videos, as my account is private. Please fix this, or I will never recommend this app, nor download it again "
"a lot of enjoyable content but. the app tends to delete/block content talking about BLM or LGBT, while letting a lot of other garbage run wild (cp, racism, etc). they were also in trouble for initially preventing videos of disabled or unattractive people from getting popular and defended it by saying they were preventing bullying (a terrible excuse). there are a lot of very talented content creators on the app but tiktok itself is incredible toxic and owned by a terrible company with no morals"
Chinese spying app. What else does one need to know how bad this app is
"Bad Platform. This feels like if the roblox mod team ran a social media platform. Theres also a high chance that this app is spying on you. For example, creators can see analytics of their own videos. They can also see the gender percentage of their views. There is no gender selection in the signup process. This means tiktok is collecting data about you and guessing your gender with it"
Report system. Its a good app but the report system is absolutely terrible. You can report something god awful and it wont ever be taken down but stuff that doesnt break guidelines is taken down all the time. If its an automated system its broke and if its a manual one then the people in charge pick and choose down to their own personal beliefs or likes
"We are losing a generation. I downloaded this app just to write this review.Im not that old. Im barely older than the people who use this app, but even then I can see the effects. Studies show shorter attention span, anxiety, and depression can come out of social media and oh boy does Tik Tok deliver on all these fronts. Not to mention its CCP controlled. They can do whatever they want with your data, all while committing whatever atrocities they want. Finally, all the dangers that have come out of this app, like that infamous tide pod challenge where teens would die eating tide pods, all for likes and shares on an app. Somehow, they still dont see they are wasting their lives on this app"
dont let any kids or teens use app. This app is sexualizing teens and people are being bullied on here all the time the app will store pretty much all of your data and here is the best way to use the app1 DELETE IT2 report it for bullying sexual content or pretty much anything3 leave a review saying its bad 4 live a great life WITHOUT this app
Pay me tiktok. Tiktok should pay me for the 5 stars and looking at my personal data
"Chinese spyware. Recently the US government found out the Chinese app TikTok was used by the Chinese to spy on its users, it is also used to show (sometimes terrorist) propaganda, and will silence any negative views about China or the Hong Kong riots overall a serious security risk to anyone looking to get it"
"chinese spyware. legit. collects 100x more data than twitter, reddit, instagram, etc. all stored on an unsecured server. not worth gambling my personal information to watch some white person do a dance"
Info about TikTok. I love TikTok it makes my day so much better than it used to be without TikTok its the best app Ive ever downloaded in my life
Tiktok. This is an amazing platform to watch and create ur own content. You can control privacy settings to make it private or public. Other than this it is a free unique app where u can express urself making 1-60 second clips to share with the world
Awful app. Stop using it it steals information form ur SIM card stay safe
Tiktok. They been selling ur info on the internet so never ever download it&gt;:l
"help. why dont i have the upload, private and the liked videos on my tiktok account? i have re downloaded it so much times. what is up tiktok"
Brandon R. Baugh. Tiktok has been a great new way of sharing my personal and professional life with both friends&Fam as well as others on this app I enjoy the format much more than other apps China hit a home run with tiktok in my opinion Thanks for allowing us this great way of socializing and connecting so many of us around the world
privacy. im under 16 but my mum manages the account so i should be allowed to let anyone comment on my videos
"_THIS_APP_SUCKS_.  Very long If I had the option to give it zero stars, I would. This app gives children access to all sorts of internet crap. Including inappropriate things. I agree with everyone else who said that this app is trash. I wish that AppStore would delete this app. Do not buy this app unless you would like to be scarred by inappropriate crap. ( Sry for the language btw just rlly angry. ) However, if you decide to buy this app dont be fooled by the filters, it will ask you what you want to be seeing and then BOOM all the inappropriate things make their way through. The filters do not work. You might think this is a good app but seriously you can seriously get yourself into bad things. See if you give info about yourself people can :: Kidnap  Rape KILL  Hack  StealAll of that stuff. So just pls dont buy this app If I could I would smash this app and watch in crumble to pieces. LETS ALL WORK TOGETHER AND GET TIKTOK DELETEDListen time :: Pls rate this review helpful so that everyone can see it"
"Unauthorized access to contacts. I am very carefully to ensure I never allow access to my contacts for any social media platform. Two months after using Tiktok, I noticed friend suggestions from people in my contacts. 1) I dont follow any friends or acquaintances on tiktok 2) none of my friends know I view tiktok videos. After seeing contacts pop up, I went to the privacy settings to ensure the access to contacts was still switch off. I found that everything was switched on. I would never allow any access, and I verified I selected the option to never be suggested to anyone else. Some how the app turned everything on without my knowing. Ive turned everything back off, but now tiktok probably has everything and I have to request my data and delete everything. Tiktok is shady just like the rest"
"Very disturbing. This app is good for when your bored and everything but over the past few months, tiktok has become way more inappropriate. Examples include profile pictures with nudity, videos encouraging nudity, videos that include racism and much more. Personally if you are a child, your parents would not be happy if they saw some things on this app. And there are a lot of weirdos that try to get personal information"
"Terrible. I thought this app was great for my kids but they kept seeing TERRIBLE content that influences bullying, body shaming and racism and others. My kids have been acting terrible ever since they got this app. They kept seeing Terrible content. Not only that but this app SPYS on you? This is extremely un safe and its not good. They spy on you through your camera and that makes me scared for my information and my kids. They can also find out your information apparently like where you live and your credit card details. Please do NOT download this app.-Kim"
Its Evil and a bad influence. Nearly every tik tok I see is just a young girl dancing or a boy taking off their shirts. Yeah I know that is not all but nearly everywhere I go on the street there is someone doing a tik tok it is such a bad influence on young children and it should be banned. ALSO the apps steals your info and is spying on you DELETE IT NOW
"Worst app ever. This is just spyware disgusied as an app, delete tiktok before you lose all of your data. You never know when the next update introduces malware"
"App 100% not working. Asking for verification and code never works, emails me same code over & over again why do I even need to give TikTok any of my private info, TikTok is retarded, totally unnecessary data mining . Shame on you"
"Love it. Tiktok is an amazing app to feel free to post what you like and watch what you like Tiktok has a huge variety of videos with different meanings and subjects Feel unsafe? Just private your account Now only people you accept can watch, like or comment on your videos. Yes, you can get ads but they are not those annoying 30 seconds ones, just one swipe of a finger and you can keep watching The for you page/ home page provides you with videos similar to the ones you have watched in the past. Overall I love this app and recommend it to all of you -Lucy"
Enjoy watching. The individuals on this platform is very created The information is great How can I advertise products on here
Its good and all but. A lot of creators have been getting banned forever for no reason just like my sister and also they keep shadowbanning small creators too...Also stop it with the privacy policy pls its preventing creators from growing you are going to lose a lot more creators on your app if you do nothing about it
Spying app. This app spies on you
I like tictok. Cus I don&#39;t have to get caught up in the privacy controversy. Because I&#39;m a viewer forever.
They literally spy on you. They sell all the data to China.Uncool
"Disgusting. If youre looking for a platform that discriminated against users for their appearance, violates your privacy, and has continuous censorship, tik tok is right for you"
Data selling. All data are going to shared with Chinese government
Sells all my data to the CCP. Nothing creepier than using this app and knowing big Xi is watching
"Worst app ever. Honestly dont download their app, the privacy is shit as it sends info to the Chinese government, its ruined society and will destroy your child"
Stealing data. You guys are making it really easy for adults to attain the videos people make and selling them. You should be in a lot of trouble right now and I suggest you smarten up or hand over your company to someone else
NO NO NO DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Tiktok is tracking you and he can see your life DONT DOWNLOADKid dont download
App glitch. Accessing unauthorized phone data. I have selected do not sync contacts across all my devices using TikTok and I am incredibly disturbed that I continue to receive notifications that my contacts (some that I dont even have as contacts anymore?) are using TikTok and to follow them. I would really like this to be fixed please It is an invasion of privacy
"Suggestion. You should add a thing where you can block certain people on a tiktok video, like only them not be able to see and everyone else. Or make a private poster for selected people, my nosy aunt decided to spy on me for a year on tiktok and i feel like i dont have any privacy what so ever and tiktok was my only resort, so maybe that could be a new update:)"
If your age appropriate its ok. Its gold I talk to my mates on here just people are asking us personal info so I block them but if your age this app is gold were best mates and we send eachother vids and stuff so ye but I would definitely download
Scam. Sharing personal info you are scammers
"The new TikTok update. 1/5  This new TikTok update is really annoying and I really dont like it, others have complained about it too and Id like if you could automatically turn it off and on in the settings on tiktok. The things I hate about this update is how every time you press on the inbox you can see all your messages and I really dont like that because what if a family member pressed the inbox, theyd see all my messages with my friends, I want some privacy So please TikTok if you could, make a turn off button.           Thank you"
"My review. Tik Tok is amazing just be careful because apparently it steals all your personal information. Like your contacts, ip addresses  and sends your drafts to the chin ease govt. Also when u post it scan your face and finds out everything about you and saves it to a data base. This is what Ive heard it may not be true but be careful"
Data Grabbing. Tik tok is a data grabbing scheme by many people do not and I mean DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP
I was banned for no reason. I woke up earlier today and opened tik tok as i usually would. When i open the app i see Your account was permanently banned due to multiple violations of our Community Guidelines i had no option other than to download my data or log out. Please get my account back
PIECE OF GARBAGE. WONT EVEN WORK AND CSNT EVEN APEAR ON MY APPS SO I CANT EVEN DELETE IT AND ALSO MY DATA COULD BE STOLEN
Ooga booga china steal my data. How about stop giving all our information to the Chinese government
My Personal Optinion. Tiktok is one of my favourite apps but a few things I recommend adding or fixing would be 1 please add extra time to create videos and 2 please give us access to changing our usernames in less than 30 days. If these 2 updates come to tiktok then I will be more than happy to give you guys a 5 star rating
"Amazing app . I recommend you get this app because it is amazing and is very good for when you are bored. My 13 year old loves this app she is wanting me to get merchandise for her. It has really good privacy settings and it is trusted  very much. You can either have a private account or public and you can choose your feed. This has got her ( my daughter ) through this time period we are in. She loves doing the videos and posting them to her friends to see. This app can also warn  your child about their safety online. TikTok is an amazing app I would get it now. Thanks, Rachel"
"Needs better monitoring. While TikTok is a great app with amazing personal feeds and inspiring creators there are still so many faults with the TikTok culture or many users on TikTok creating a toxic environment at best and at worst parades of homophobic, racist, cancel culture, and much much worse. I believe TikTok can be a great place for many but without proper systems to keep its communities on track it is having an active effect on manys daily lives. With so many youth using this app it can be so harmful to their mindset and bring them up in improper ways that could effect them and their lives in the future. In conclusion, a great app with some good content but a lot of toxicity and harmful users"
"COMEPLETE TRASH. i wanted download it because i deleted because i heard of China spying and stuff, so i download it and it wont even let me make an account everytime. actual trash"
"Super Duper. Im 70 years old and I have to tell you, Im loving TikTok I just recently joined, and I havent laughed this much in many years I have to admit, I spend way too much time on this app. Its so much fun, and such a pick me up for the day, even though Ive heard that it is spyware for the Chinese. Well, if thats the case, I need to Let them know Im really not worthy of spying on. Ha ha Ha Anyway, thanks for this app Its a blast"
"Everything I ever needed to know I can learn on tik tok. I wish I could say Im not addicted to the steady influx of incredible information, laughter, community, but I am. This app is the only one I need anymore. No YouTube no gram, no snap... Ill keep Facebook for family and friends. Thats about it"
Brilliant. This app is epic Been using it for a couple of months and the privacy settings are really good as I can make vids and share them with my friends. Brilliant features and really fun
Best app I have. Say good buy to you friends and your data Lol this is addictive 
DONT DOWNLOAD. TIKTOK IS A SPYWARE AND IS SPYING ON YOU AND FINDING ALL YOUR PASSWORDS ON YOUR SAVED CLIPBOARD PLEASE PLEASE BE SAFE
Awful. Terrible app that is probably stealing your data
Perfect. This platform is perfect. Idgaf China is harvesting our data. So is every other government agency and corporation 
TikTok. I personally love this app so much I recommend it. And it is also amazing because u can have privacy with making your account private. I just love tiktok so much. It is number 1 
Enjoying with TikTok. I like TikTok but why you keep band my videos for no reason? I follow your privacy 
If you want real information I suggest you download TikTok right now and get off fake media. Come and join the family and be awaken
Tracking my location. How is tiktok able to tract my location even if my mobile has a vpn app to change my location. I didnt get any request from tiktok saying that it would like to access my location
Deleting accounts. I love the app but I accidentally deleted tiktok on my device and I dont remember the password and dont know the email so maybe you can make update of not deleting data like other apps or maybe let use email multiple times about 3 times (pls make update on that plss my account was @chaddison.editssss and miss it very much I cry everyday cause of that problem)
Its very bad. Dont they like steal data and hide content from ugly usersp
Banned for no reason . Im upset bc it banned me after a month and idk why bc I never put anything bad and now I have too restore my data and start all over again 
TikTok. Great app. Not a lot of bugs. The only thing is that I would appreciate it if you can update my experience. I put the wrong birthday on my account and now my privacy settings are restricted
DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY. Dont download this app Its owned by a creepy Chinese company who a selling tiktoks to HACKERS DONT make any tiktoks its WAY too risky
"Cringe garbage. Full of pedos, minors, and cringy idiots, collects more data than google and Facebook combined, owned by bytedance, a company that swore to give any and all data to the Chinese government anytime they want"
"why you shouldnt be worried about your data. china doesnt care about your personal date, especially the limited data they have access to from tiktok"
"Do not download because of your safety. PLEASE READ THIS ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE END This review is not for just because its horrible but because this is a Chinese spying app, it can take pictures of you and then it can use all of your camera pictures to spy on you, So again, DO NOT DOWNLOAD Please tell everybody you know about this. They are also allowing pedophilles and sexual content to be made on here, they are ALSO allowing people do stupid life threatening challenges and let people make content telling people to commit suicide. I genuinely enjoyed it because of the funny, cool videos people make, but then I realized people can actually spy on you. Please copy and paste this so other people can see it. Thank you. AND AGAIN DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP"
"Best app ever. This app is so good I dont now how I would live without it, I can do cool things and show my friend what Im up to during quarantine, it doesnt steal info, this app makes my day"
"The easy way to get hacked. This app is bad, you will get your info sent to the Chinese government. So if you want to not get hacked. Delete this app"
"Inappropriate to public. The main idea for this app is to entertain everyone instead of that some users post very disturbing content.Also, many communities are violated by this stuff. My personal opinion is to shut down this app as soon as possible and users please dont let your children use this app if you want to protect them"
Predatory platform that promotes Pedophilia. Here are numerous documented reports online of tiktok moderators being paid to remove fat and disabled people from their platform to gain a better public perception. Also farming data from minors. Also deleting that Indian guys perfectly normal tiktok due to mass reporting from butthurt idiots. Need I go on?
DO NOT DOWNLOAD TIKTOK. TIKTOK USES MALWARE SEEING MANY PERSONAL THINGS FAR BEYOND THAN WHAT OTHER APPS DO. DELETE TIKTOK NOW
I enjoy but HUGE lack of privacy. The amount of times that I will have my phone sitting on my bedside while talking to my partner about several different topics and then the next day the same topics will pop up on my tick-tock and I really dont like that
Full of pedophiles. Dont download this if you value your privacy and time. Specially if you want your kids to be safe from all those pedophiles lurking all around the app
Tiktok is good just suggestions. I love tiktok Ive been using the app for years but one thing that I really wish they had is a privacy setting for videos where you can choose the people you want to be able to see the video. Kind of like a private story on Snapchat except its on the video. There are also accounts on tiktok that just report a bunch of innocent accounts for things they didnt do and then tiktok ends up banning them. This happened to me and a lot of my friends and its definitely a serious problem
"Love it. I love it how you can record vids and use filters, and that you can have private accounts because when you have a private account you get Sent requests, and theres just nothing wrong with the app"
"So much wrong with this app DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Theres so much to unpack I dont even know where to start, They shadowbanned content about BLM until it became trendy. Creators who posted about going to protests and BLM were shadowbanned and banned from posting for a few days. Some even lost their accounts.They deleted accounts about those who spoke out against a pedophile on the app that was a popular creator and verified, because it was controversial material Anonymous exposed them with receipts of someone who reverse engineered the app to see that its actually Chinese Malware used to for spying. India banned the app for a reason.I had my videos stolen and the video about me bringing awareness got taken down but not the stolen videos. Myself and the other victims who had their videos stolen by the same person had to email tiktok a bunch of times to get the videos taken down.Anyone who isnt apart of straight tiktok aka anyone who isnt a pretty girl making dance videos or attractive eboy is shadowbanned. They have publicly admitted to shadowbanning those who they consider not attractive. They also tend to shadowban visible minorities, those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. They claim its to prevent bullying. However Im very doubtful of that.For cosplayers, you cant even use the hashtags, saw the word in the video, or type it in the caption or your video will end up shadowbanned.In summary, if you value your private information, do not download this app"
"everything is wrong with this app. before i start this rant just dont install this app, chinese government run the app and they steal your data and sell it for moneythis app is literally so bad, racist people, rude people, chinese government runs this app, bad community, everyone in comment section saying W, L, fatherless, ratio, bozo, skull emoji, weird community, furrys, people who sexually attracted to animals, to many weird people, like bots liking your comments, weird bios, gay people, lgbt, people posting CP, bad community rules, weirdos on tiktok live, kids that literally beg you to gift in their live stream, people making kids kill their self, and the tiktok algorithm is impossible to go viralplus this app is like 200mb but the data and documents are 600mb"
Spying on me. Idk probs spying on me why is life a thing. Ima rate 1 star because this app makes innocent kids into demon children
Spying on me. Im so grateful to the Chinese government for making this app so that they can spy on me and use their facial recognition software to have a permanent scan of my facial features xoxo
"this app is toxic. at first it was all fun and games but its getting so toxic and NOT a safe space. and not even including the fact that this app is CHINESE SPY WARE, and theyre stealing our information. using it for various illegal activities, and its all covered up please get off this app"
"Bad. 1. Tik tok has become so toxic 2. There is spyware- China is trying to find out info about you and collects yours data. Bad, dont use it. Not safe"
Stupid TikTok. I dont like it at all because its the Chinese spying app
GIVING AWAY ALL YOUR DATA. you dont realise but youre giving away a lot of your data (not ready t&amp;cs)
Amazing Entertainment. Its a shame they steal your data
Sells your data to the Chinese. They do
Its ok. Tik toc used to be the best but their new update really change the app. I get that they do things for privacy but some of the updates are making my for you page so dry. Im still going to be using the app tho
Tiktok. Really bad dont download stealing data
Tick-tock has bad words and more. TikTok can cause child predators and  can also make a little moreTrouble and also when I deleted this app for a very good reason they seriously still keep your account like its nothing And also it doesnt really have a good job saving your privacy I have to tell my friends that TikTok its not allowed for kids can you do a age thing so the parents can see it and if theyre younger you can just kick them out of the app and Ill be much more better than even allowing them to see the bad words of that  Do much more betterand dont you say your words that you always say all the time I wanna talk to a real person
Serious risk. When I first got the app today I press the log in button it gave me choices to log in but I was old enough to have eithe off the apps so I pressed log in with Apple and it asked me for personal information
Useless application. Destroy this application by rating them low. Teach them a lesson for data breach
This is so annoying. Dont get me wrong I love tiktok Im always on lt interacting with friends but Im so angry with this feature. Sometimes I delete TikTok accidentally while trying to delete something else and every single time (twice now) Ive had a mental breakdown because when its deleted all the account data is deleted and Id like me you have bad memory it is impossible to get back Ive lost 5 accounts to that two of which I spent months even years on some working to get a decent platform just to never get it back. I hope something can be done
Collects too much data. Stop collecting data from my phone
"People Are Wrong. Lots of people are saying that tiktok doesnt support BLM or LGBT+ but it does. There are lots of trans and black people on my fyp and tiktok is supportive of that, and to the people saying that tiktok is inappropriate and that they dont like that this is how to fix that: all you need to do is create a private account and put restricted mode on. Restricted mode filters out all the inappropriate tiktoks on your fyp and replaces them with appropriate ones for you to watch. Also I just want to point out that tiktok does not take your personal information it is a company in China that is set up to hack peoples accounts and take their personal information and if that makes you uncomfortable you have 2 choices A: Dont download tiktok in the first place, or B: Dont create an account and just use tiktok for the videos"
Enjoy using TikTok. Its a lot of useful information
Worst App. I get to know that they didnt delete the accounts of the people like Tiktok get banned in India but there accounts is still there on Tiktok and people who are in India cant open a tiltok so that they can delete their accounts so it is invading the privacy of the people like everyone can access the accounts ghat nobody is using and stole their information. Tiktok is caring about how many people downloaded it
"Omg. This is the best app on the planet Like vine but still in use  Great content on it Fun to start an account  I totally recommend it to anyone who wants to get it, privacy setting can be on and you can have a private account Absolutely outstanding app"
Shady. The app is a pawn for China. it steals information that is dose not need and probably all for China
hacked. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APPMY PHONE WAS HACKED AFTER AND DONALD TRUMP CAME TO MY HOUSE TO FIX ITTTTT HE SAID HE WAS GONNA BAN TIKTOK DONTNTTT USE THIS APP IF U WANT ORANGES ALL OVER UR SCREEN
Steals data. They steal data
Their stealing your info. I have seen a lot of things that lead me to believe ther stealing your info at one point they were in court for it and a organisation of hackers called anonymous have posted on Twitter that they know their stealing it they have also discriminated poc and overweight people by shadow banning them I once reported a person that was clearly abusing axolotls by crushing them with clams and also not putting them in the right environment they didnt stop anything also do not ban over sexualised content
"Everybody Make Some Tick Tok. A fun and easy to use app, in which you can view 15,30,60 video clips, that you take with your iPhone, and share them around the worldSo much fun, has a parental safe mode. Only downside is the current company it owned by a Chinese technology company. (thats where the data, is stored also)"
"Overall I really love this app. This is a great app to create and share content. I love watching peoples lives. I like that its pretty different from Facebook and instagram. I like that you dont see whose online so it gives you a bit more privacy to browse whenever you want. If I had to pick something to improve on it would be the Live features. It gets laggy a lot and people have to reset often. I also hate how people get banned for some of the stupidest reason. I dont think its fair for peoples live accounts to auto shut down just because an ignorant person doesnt like that someones shirtless or something. If people dont like it they can just leave, why ban an account and ruin it for everyone else"
"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app is horrible it has racist inappropriate content it bans peoples accounts and TRACKS YOU everywhere you go and everything you do, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, this app also encourages stress eating insecurities etc. I also want to say that this encourages younger children to LEARN inappropriate dances and language it also censores peoples videos when there is nothing wrong with the video but then when their is something sexy or suicidal they dont censor it. I myself had tik tok for a very long time and I thought it was a great app, I made lots of videos went on my for you page and enjoyed myself but sometimes there would be hate pages and Inappropriate videos and I would get influenced by that. Honestly I hope that everyone realizes that this app is taking all of your data and information so please stay safe uninstall this app and help it get banned for being racist promoting bad behaviour towards children and banning LGBTQ+ accounts. I hope you all stay safe and healthy"
. Hello tictok I need help I deleted this app a while ago and Im trying to download it again and its asking me for my billing info however I love this app I just need help fixing that
"Don't download Please read. Notice how all of the reviews are 1 star? And Tiktoks rating is 4.7 stars? Yeah it&#39;s pretty clear they but fake ratings. Also, look at the data they take from you. LOCATION, BROWSER AND SEARCH HISTORY, and a lot more personal information. It&#39;s not safe for small kids or anyone really. Don&#39;t download this app because they don&#39;t even protect your data either. Horrible app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
Garbage. Nothing but terrible content and information stealing
"I dont really like the under 16 privacy update. Over all this app is great, Ive had it for over 2 years now and Ive loved it. But I just have something to say about the recent under 16 privacy update. I get that youre looking out for us and trying to protect our privacy, but our video settings should be our choice. And since you have to be 13 or older to make an account, being over 13 but under 16 shouldnt affect anything. But apart from that its great"
"not worth it. if u have anger issues i definitely advise u not to get this app, most the time it just doesnt load the comments or doesnt load any videos and as of right now it will not load anything ive deleted it and re installed it, my wifi and my mobile data is working for everything but tiktok , it is the app and if u have bad anger issues DO NOT INSTALL"
"This app is terrible. Awful UI, asks for too much data and is a cesspit for people with foul impressionable minds to gather"
Omg. This app is the best thing ever it is so creative and great privacy settings
"pls let my private all my videos. i love that ive been on tiktok since its original name and trends but im embarrassed by the videos posted by myself and i wish i could spam private them, due to the anoint of videos i have. please please tiktok help me up :D"
Love TikTok. 100% best app yet to data
Asking data. Selling datas and deleting reviews? Wow haha not ethical
Dont get this app. Its horrible theres so much people being racist and think its funny and a trend. And They also invade your privacy DO - NOT - GET - THIS - APPTheres way more then that Im sure of it
"DO NOT INSTALL. This app has been decompiled and it shows that they send all of your data (camera, microphone, even other suttle things like clipboard data to mainland China. If you like your privacy, do not install.Whinnie the pooh"
Its a china app China is just using all your data for their data. I hate it it is boring
"RUBBISH app. Absolute con. First off, the app requires a lot of your personal information when making an account so you can record videos. Who knows when they might get the chance to hack you.Secondly, a lot of people end up getting cyber bullied online and when they go to report it, the developers do NOTHING. Absolutely idiotic.Next up is inappropriate content. Yet again, when people go to report it, the developers do NOTHING This just gets even more stupid as the list goes on.Lastly, the app constantly keep bans users with an account for literally NO reason. A lot of the time, the app is saying that the people have violated the policy. This could be streaming when youre underage (even though youre over 16), or just suddenly getting banned for nothing.This issue is a lot more serious as people who do enjoy Tic-Tok are now really angry, and even crying, due to the fact that they get banned from using the app for no reason whatsoever. And when they report the issue, guess what...THE DEVELOPERS DO NOTHING. So you can clearly see why people hate this app. The people who made Tic Tok should highly be ashamed of this garbage"
"Caution. The amount of media Ive seen showing young teens getting bullied (body shamed, sexualized etc.) is horrible. You cant express yourself innocently on this app. And to add the fact that the app is owned by a Chinese group that collects and can distribute data from you and your phone is concerning"
Waste of time. If your about to download this app its a waste of time change of mind set. I used to have this app I got over tiktok and got rid of it dont get
Doxing. This app promotes and allowing personal photos and doxing people STILL is outrageous
TIK TOK is a bad app. I really dont like it when google deletes bad reviews. Good and tik tok both use your data and spy on you. The only difference here is one app is Chinese. And I personally dont like it when my private information is shared. Thats why I use duck duck go and not google. Tik tok can have some good stuff on it but I feel like it has underage people than it should posting on it. It make the app feel weird. Like a lot of adults use but then you see this 12 year old kid on it too. It makes it very weird in my opinion. Tik tok is bad
Worst app ever. This app is very bad they can track you and they take down accounts for no reason. Its racist and disgusting 
"DONT LET YOUR KIDS ON THIS APP. Biased and unfair, dangerous app. This app allows the most misogynistic, homophobic, all the ist and phobes accounts and content with lots of followers to stay up even after I report them. Tiktok claims to be safe for minors but it shows otherwise. Instead, innocent accounts (such as mine) are permanently banned with no warning or explanation at all. I was not told what I had done wrong or had a chance to reflect on my behaviour if I had done anything to violate community guidelines. That account I have had for 5 years and all my personal information such as my phone number is still attached to it. Contact and email tiktok for support? Dont even think about it, they wont get back to you. They allow hateful pages up and dont respond well to reports. This is not a safe app for minors as I have seen firsthand this app turn kids into bigots by all the bias by allowing bigger pages to stay up and unfairly banning smaller ones"
"Sends Personal Information to China. This app is dangerous, its being used by China to control kids in the hope theyll become brainwashed and destroy the fabric of society form the inside out. China wont win this war"
"Love the app but. Its great and all I just hate how you have to be, 16 and older send messages, Im 15 and I had friends who talk to me on there but now I cant due to safer privacy"
:(. Worst app ever not only is the Chinese government is spying on you but has no good content
TikTok. Tik Tok is a magnificent app and couldn&#39;t be better I&#39;ve had it since it was musical.ly and it&#39;s an app where you can let the world know that you exist you can post your dealing and decide weather you want the world to see you and your videos or not when your account is on private you can accept them which allows them to see your videos so you can chose who to send them to if you would like and have a phone number on your account you can message people who also have a phone number and if you have a gmail or iCloud exetera but you can still do every thing else you can add accounts without signing out of your account and make your profile Unser name profile picture or video what ever you want you can put a bio and a message of everyone at the top there is no inappropriate videos allowed you can also say that your not interested in videos and report them and block them thank you for for deciding to read my review that&#39;s all I have to say I think bye thank you so much
"listen. you banned me for being 5 years old sorry but my account is verified, i have an email a personal phone number everything is proven including my age being old enough to be on this app. you PERMANENTLY banned me and still wont let me use my phone number anymore and thats my only phone number. so if you could unban my account which is @joeynero.hasspoken that would be great or i would be sending more complaints"
Spy software from big brother. This APP like a spy software running in your phone to track everything about you
Save TIK TOK. Please fight to keep tiktok Sell it to Microsoft or someone the USA trusts
Chinese App must be banned. This app is proved to be stealing people privacy snd credit card details and should be uninstalled from phones
"MISLEADING INFO. TikTok gave me misleading information about Snapchat and Im very disappointed it always needs updated and theres no point in it, its just like Instagram but 10x worse do NOT download"
VERY fun app. I love tiktok because u can do whatever u want and it is just so fun to know u have the freedom to do what u want. The privacy settings are good when u enable what u want.Tiktok is AMAZING
Tiktok. Tiktok is amazing I am totally addicted the only down side is that they can find all of your personal info on your phone or tablet from 2 years ago Tiktok is great and the dances are amazing but if u have it u are risking your personal safety. I was sad to delete it but at least my information stays safe also tiktok please change your ways I would love to download u again
TikTok. TikTok Beta not be spying on me
Pros and cons of TikTok. Pros: it allows me to connect with people both from my religion and not  It fills me with utter joy and laughter It shows me life hacks and recipes unlike any other app They have added a caption feature and some have access to longer videosCons: TikTok allows inappropriate content to run rampant on their app  TikTok also allows underage children to be on the app  TikTok refuses to take down inappropriate content but punishes wholesome content creators by shadow banning them or randomly removing their content God bless you
"This App was good until. Ive been using TikTok since its been called musical.ly. I started in 2018 and I still HAD the same account. It had all of my stuff in it and now I found out that I got banned? For what reason? YOU BLOODY WANKAS- Im sorry unprofessional. The rage I feel right now is unspeakable and Ive had to create a whole new account, no data and no trace of my videos from my old account. I have no idea why Ive been banned as Ive mentioned before"
Another Espionage Tool. An app that serves the political objectives of dictatorial regimes and has utmost disregard for privacy all in the name of providing platform to rising talents
"Collecting personal information from children?. Why are you collecting information about children, including their location?  That is alarming behaviour and I question the intentions behind this predatory behaviour. Is tik tok run by child molesters? Because thats who collects this kind of information from children"
DONT DOWNLOAD. All it dose is take you information DONT DOWNLOAD
Scary. Collects data and China sells the data theyve collected from you
" DO NOT DOWNLOAD TIKTOK  . This Chinese app is BAD and HORRIBLE they created this app to SPY ON CHILDREN Please parents if ur reading This PLEASE DONT LET UR CHILDREN DOWNLOAD THIS APP IS NOT GOOD Or if any children are reading this, this is for everyones safety  please everyone this app is bad also our accounts somehow get BANNED for NO REASON RIGHT? if u can delete ur account then do it if u want :) Stay safe everyone "
Communist Party of China is Spying. If you care about Hong Kong freedoms or care about the CCPC using the app to spy on you then DELETE IT #boycottchina
HORRIBLE. I liked the app at first but as I used it I saw a lot of people saying that tiktok is ran by the Chinese government and they are selling your information and Watching you on your camera it is definitely an unstable app  
Its alright but. I love the app and has used it since musically but.. im worried as my brother showed me something about the terms of service and he said i should delete this as it could be a privacy problem
Something. This app is insane even if China are hacking our data
Unsafe app. Does not support healthy habits and is the epicentre of data mining
Annoying. I get banned for no reason then delete the app now I cant get it because I try to download it and it says billing information and then I have to pay its so stupid
I liked this app once. I recently deleted this app because I was recently informed that this steals your information and they scan your face and even look at your drafts.they also look through your search history and the apps you have this is not ok
"Tiktok Isnt Bad. People are complaining about the people on tiktok, its not tiktoks fault And about racism tiktok isnt racist, its the people on tiktok that are racist, also tiktok does not steal your info If you got the information about tiktok stealing your info from a video doesnt mean its true Please stop the hate. People on tiktok could be toxic, but its not the apps fault Again, stop the hate"
Miss it. Ok so I got this WAY back in September I think it rlly was fun but in same month I got a random call. So my granny (I live with her) told me to delete it so I did but on Thursday a got a random call asking for personal info so its NOT tiktok make m mum or dad/carer read this stay safe :)
this app sukcs. this app is removing floptok which is my land of people i will be deleting the app and i will steal from people to delete it off their phones too. dont u dare remove us
Chinese spyware. I herd that tik tok has Chinese spyware it steals your information and your probably going to deny it but I think its true
"absolutely amazing app. Hey TikTok, This app is great I love it just thought I could ask if for a new update could it be when u post a video could you choose who sees it and Ik you can have it private public or friends but I mean look at all your followers and following and click on the people you dont want to see it xx thank you hope this can happen"
"this is an amazing app. this app is so amazing you can make your own videos,use filters,meet new people, and watch other peoples videos. it also had privacy as an option. i love this app"
"Love it . Lots to love about this app, lots of laughs, good information, news and so much more Best platform out there USE IT Its awesome"
Data usage. Am addicted to tik tok only complaint as I use mainly mobile data tiktok high definition vids eats my data please tik tik do like you tube does so you select quality of vids to lower data usage but i found in settings a toggle u turn off to lower definition. Tiktok should have beter help menu
Waste of time. It has wasted millions of precious hours of youngsters. It should be banned right away. Im such a big hater of tiktok that I only downloaded this app to give review on iOS. I know every app has a bad part in it but this app is king of badness. Tiktokers dont get offended its my personal review. And you guys will agree if you think deeply. Cheers
terrible and terrifying. this app has turned into so many bad things. i looked into this and the new owners need to access everything on your phone. photos contacts apps messages notes everything. There is also so much hate and violence on this app its unbelievable.It used to be such a great app but now its terrifying. downloads it if you want to give all your information to a city in china to stalk you
One of the worst social media apps that has been created yet. It not only has a mentally ill fan base but also steals your data. I wish there was an option to rate this 0 stars
Worth it. I bet the Chinese government is spying on us but its totally worth it. Love the app
HORRIBLE. WHY IS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT USING IT TO SPY LIKE WTF CAN WE HAVE PRIVACY? GOSH I WOULD RATE IT A 0
Not safe. If you want spywear on your phone and if you want your information going to the Chinese governmentGive it a download
"Tik tok fix this. Ok so Im a creator on tik tok and have a pro account, but I went on tik tok today to check my analytics, but it was not there. I totally freaked out and clicked on manage account to check if I still had a pro account, and I did not. All of my data is now gone and thats not even the worst part The worst part, is that when I clicked to switch to a pro account AGAIN, it did not allow me, saying something stupid that read, uh oh, the servers deserted What kind of idiocy is this I am so annoyed right now and these kind of things have happened a lot over the past few months. Tik tok, fix this immediately .Sincerely An Angry Makeup Artist"
Its OK. Personally I think it could be updated with better privacy and security I think that TikTok could be better and it doesnt have to be for just 12 and up it should be for about 10 and up I like TickTock but thats just the reasons why it needs to be fixed
"An app for everyone. TikTok is a great app The For You page is incredible, over time it adapts to content YOU like, and surprisingly it does very well It has content for everyone and is very addictive"
Uh ya. Good I hope theyre not  like stealing my data tho hehe
"I like this app but. Spyware is kinda terrifying, I dont want the Asians gaining all of my god damn information"
"Fantastic App/Community. Check me out: bigdaddyjtp  This app literally saved my life, would recommend to anyone looking to get out of there shell or just for a good laugh or feels, supportive inclusive community (mostly), dont listen to the negative news, trust me if they wanted your data, there are many other apps that do the same thing, dont shun this app because they target it in the media Much love, have a wonderful day"

Shit app. I just love how yall steal childrens info
TikTok review. Honestly Id say its good but honestly its easy to hack people and hate on them but you can filter comments so id say best app on my phone you should 100% download it
"Tiktok. Very nice, but you must respect the privacy of the complainant of annoying people"
Tiktok. The only thing is that it uses a lot of data
"BEST APP EVER . Honestly hands down the best social media app ever created  I know I can speak for many other users when I say Tik tok has provided information , hacks, food and so much more that wouldve gone unknown if it wasnt for the app. Best part of my day is when Im on the app Shout out to the creators  Real MVP"
"Documents and data. Had had around 500mb to 600mb in documents and data, but then my sister deleted the app and now I cant go back in my account, the account name is julianisperson and I forgot my password so I tried to reset it and its give a different account each time I try All I want is to go back in my account to talk with friends and watch other people. So tiktok pls email me what my password word is PLEASE"
Best app ever. Freedoms and fun is highest in this app and feel it is a great place to meet others and learn about everyone on the planet to allow such  personal videos it has change our view as a collective and given the people more power in self understanding of individuals around the planet well done tiktok is a better app for theses facts giving the individual the chance to learn about everyone they chat with on here and watch personal videos thank you for such great freedom
"Horrible. This app is terrible , Tiktok takes ur private information without consent , and every time I make a Tiktok it exits me out the app and glitches , another thing is I cant hear my saves audios for some reason"
Eating battery. Uninstalled these Chinese spyware as it kept hogging battery life even I used it hardly during the day. I suspect it kept running even though stopped using it. I constantly saw my data and location was being accessed by app while not using it. Would not install again
Know about Hack of this tiktok. Tiktok can hack your phone and can download all of the things if them want please delete the tik tok
"Tic Toc. If you look at the first page where you signed up, look down their Data can retrieve anything they want.. address, phone, financial records, passwords ANYTHING you think is private, its all out there like they own all your business Just Read. I was told this Tic Toc was being looked at by China Maybe they started Tic Toc "
THEY STEAL YOUR LIFE. TikTok have been spying on us for a long time I was talking about horses to a friend the other day then all of a sudden videos of horses came up on TikTok The government listen to us through this I know non of you will believe me but just wait to we see whos laughing in the end when your whole life gets taken off you
"All hail the communist Chinese party. Supreme leader Xi Jing Ping, thank you for allowing us to store our personal data on your servers. We are most grateful for you protecting our private information"
Amazing but one thing. I think the app is great but Ive been banned multiple times for no reason at all and its really annoying Im downloading the data right now but I have to wait like 4 days
China. Chinese government is spying on you if you are using the app
TIKTOK YOU NEED TO FIX THIS. So I had TikTok for a year until the hackers came and took personal info and credit cards and use them then two months later I find out that the problem sorted and fixed and if you want to take the chance that you could download TikTok and I love tick-tock so I did then a month later I got a message from my mum to delete TikTok Then later finding out that after people posting their videos people hacking into them and putting a video of a person killing them self with a gun to the head let me remind you there are people as young as 5 on this app l loved TikTok but it needs to be more safe
Im scared. The someone account tracks you
Just wow. I told someone who was saying they wanted to jill themselves not to. Apparently the person had done a bad thing so i got reported a bunch and my acc got banned. So nice of a Tik Tok. They also dont give u ur data back once u submit an appeal and request the data
"Biased and suppressing anything that doesnt appeal to the mainstream. Watched a video where an ex staff member outted them for playing favorites and letting human moderators give warnings to people for personal reasons and not because they actually broke guidelines. I realized all the videos of mine they deemed were sexual content or nudity had one thing in common, which is I was wearing a chained harness I bought from killstar. Non of the videos I posted were even bad, they were all either OOTD videos or trying trends. As someone who advocates for individuality I am very disappointed in this. The fact is, if youre noticing your videos are being taken down and you didnt break guidelines, thats means someone on the tiktok staff has it out for you or has a personal vendetta against something your wear or do"
This is bad. So i had a tik tok account for a while and now it has been hacked so if u want to get this app be careful because u could be hacked lucky it was just an old email so they dont know where i live so thx god for that but if u are using this app and u only have 1 account for everything be careful and ye bye
"Love it, great for learning, entertainment and information of all kinds. Just hope theyre not using our personal info for bad"
Deffo recommend but. I loveeeeee this app its addicting I was on it before writing this review but the only thing TikTok needs to change is dms like texting ur friends on the app you have to add a phone number and its annoying my phone number is already registered so I cant do it againTikTok can u either let us use the same number again or plz update this app and let us dm out friends from TikTok without using a number  overall its an incredible app
"Often a toxic community to be a part of. Want to be exposed to toxic points of views and be penalized for defending marginalized people from bigots? Youve come to the right place. This app wont help you reach more people, unless youre ready to sell your self esteem. And if youre not contributing, youre literally wasting your time. 2 stars, because I have seen some incredible things (right or wrong) on the platform. The best and worst of humanity in one spot"
Steals your information and promotes racist content. This app promotes racism and hate speech. The US Army also banned military officers and their families from having the app on their phone because they steel your information.1/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND.PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.  IF YOU HAVE DELETE THIS IT IMMEDIATELY
Annoying little kids and more. I love this app but few problems. The kid under 12 using tiktok and you kept shadow banning me. Never taken down a racist video but taken down my for harassing and bullying. Please let me open my comment to public cuz there is a thingy Tiktok restricted privacy AHHHHYeah and mean little kids and scammer? PLEASE TELL MY WHY Wouldnt you TAKEN DOWN THE SCAMMING AND SPAM ACC BUT MINETHats all pretty amazing tbh
"CRAPPPP . If you are reading this do not get tik tok If you do the Chinese is getting all your information and talking it and using it for anything. Think, do you want your information online for anyone to see"
Its so dumb. Dont get it if you do it will track ur location and see you through the app and can kidnap you just like Angela the app
"Good but. Right, I love this app. Its an incredible app where you can message, post and loads of other fun things but there is one problem. Sometimes the content is inappropriate for example people showing bruises form being abused or abusing others. Personally I think they should have a scanner or something that makes sure the video is appropriate and then if its not you cant post it. I have no other concerns about this app. I would appreciate if you took my opinion into account to stop the spread of upsetting content. Thanks for taking your time to read this. "
removed my video which is fine but wont let me save to my personal device. they removed one of my tiktoks for breaking community guidelines but i just wanted to save it to my device because i liked it and no intentions of reposting it but now i cant even save it. so annoying
"Please verify my account. Please verify my account so I can see few money to take care of my family, I have spent a lot. Have lost many account due to live video and to get verify. But I open new account over some months now but at this moment Im too broke to buy data or my TikTok accessories to continue please help"
TikTok. I really like this app but it usually takes a lot of space in my phone and it takes a lot of data in a few seconds.Go  TikTok 
TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy  
TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy
I love tik tok. Its ok if the Chinese government it farming my data because the content on this app is worth it
TikTok. It is an amazing app although I ended up having to get rid of it because it started to become very addicting. I do understand there is nothing you can do about it though one thing I don&#39;t like is the fact that u have to be on wifi and u can&#39;t use data
Addicting. Addictive and Im sure they are stealing my info
Their stealing your info. I have seen a lot of things that lead me to believe ther stealing your info at one point they were in court for it and a organisation of hackers called anonymous have posted on Twitter that they know their stealing it they have also discriminated poc and overweight people by shadow banning them I once reported a person that was clearly abusing axolotls by crushing them with clams and also not putting them in the right environment they also do not ban over sexualised content
"TikTok there goes 6 hours . I love this app. It makes me so happy. The talent on here is incredible. I just like to watch and I have so many favourite categories. The only thing I dont like is hearing and seeing nasty comments. If you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all. Lets make this different to the other social media apps. Those people need to really do some self reflection and determine where that is coming from. Also I cant make sense of why some videos that should break the Internet dont have as many Likes as some where the creator is doing nothing. But aside from those two things, I love it and it has brought so much joy and happiness into my life "
"Hate it. It literally steals your information. They use it to spy on you to, they track you down, shadow ban you for standing up to BLM, and thats not all. And also there is actually good creators who get almost no followers and likes, and then there are 4 year olds who get 10 million followers for just doing nothing. It also made me addicted, with made me lose my job, my family, and my house do to this app. Once agin do not get this app. If tic tok sees this review they are probably going to shadow ban me for making this review"
Review. Its good in the sense that you can find some useful information on the app if you know where to look
"Tiktok is amazing. Hello If your reading this review and wondering if u should download tiktok, well your in the right place Ima about to tell u everything about tiktok So first, tiktok is amazing you can listen to music and watch ppl dance and lots of more The best thing is that tiktok keeps you safe noting inappropriate well come up And Im writing this review bc there is something I want to change. You know that when u go to ur settings (tiktok settings) u go to privacy and to comments it says that only the followers that I follow and they follow me back can comment and I really want to change that bc there is a lot of ppl who dont follow back and they wanna comment on my videos so it well be amazing if you could change that I know your trying to keep me safe and stuff like that but I just wanna let other people have a chance so please tiktok change this for me Love"
"Bad app. This app is a very terrible app. Terrible community. Provocative videos. Allows users to be Racist, Cyber bully, homophobia. This is why I cut my TikTok addiction You should too TikTok is also a very shady app and it knows all of your data and information such as. Phone hardware, CPU type, number of course, hardware ids, other apps you have installed, network, IP address, wifi access point name. Wether or not your phone is jailbroken. STOP USING THIS APP"
Dont get this app. This app is stealing peoples information its actually true and its full of weird videos youtube is better it has everything
Guys please delete TikTok. Hello I am writing to TikTok  because you have to delete it. All the videos that YOU upload automatically goes to Byte Dance the creators of TikTok. This pretty much sends data to China and as you have seen on the news China and India have already banned TikTok because of security concerns. Please delete it before you have more misery when it gets BANNED. YOUR videos are not private if you make them private because byte dance sees it. The creativity on TikTok is good but children under five years old go on TikTok. There are a lot of disturbing and not child friendly content on TikTok. Thankyou for reading my review have a good day.
storage. i love tiktok n all BUT it takes up 1.17GB of data and ive cleared my cache. wish it took up less data 
Dont download. The Chinese government is taking data. Never believe that authoritarian government
*chefs kiss*. Love this app sm Even if it does steal my data i dont mind bc this app is amazing
TIK Tok. I lasted on TIK Tok four and half years on TIK Tok and it was great until The TEAM on TIK Tok blocked me and my friends accounts and allowed hackers to access all our information and trying to hack are accounts on all Devices and also trying to hack other apps we use and stilling all the information so they can pretend it use well it is very very very very uncalled for and the team of TIK Tok must get they act together or get team fired  and lose everything because that what you done to me and my friends how would you feel if we did it too you and your team you wouldnt like it at all     
"horrible app. Absolutely terrible. Words can&#39;t describe how stupid this app is. you ban accounts for no reason, you take down videos about the news, you shadowban lgbtq+/bipoc/disabled people&#39;s accounts and then use said minorities for 1 second during Tiktok ads just for &#34;activism&#34;; you don&#39;t care about any users of Tiktok except for plain, basic white girls who don&#39;t deserve half of the fame they get. Not to mention that you literally hoard people&#39;s personal information like it&#39;s a goldmine. I don&#39;t recommend Tiktok to anyone. Don&#39;t get this app. I don&#39;t care if this review might get deleted since Tiktok can&#39;t handle being called out, they&#39;re just babies who love running from the truth. This app is so awful. Fix it or we&#39;re boycotting"
"anonymous finds out that there is a chinese spy spying on the user. i used to like tiktok until... this happened. and eveyone should hear of this. so, when i was scrolling down on tiktok, i saw a video saying that anonymous hacks tiktok and finds out that there is a chinese spy thing that is tracking you through the camera which is why it is red in the dark. anonymous is warning us and telling us that we must delete tiktok NOW for our own safety"
If you hate tiktok and say bad things Im here to say something. Hey you guys Yeah Im talking to you. I dont know why everyone is saying bad things to the app. If you dont like the app then dont download this. (Well some people love this app.)
"Its okay but. This app is really fun and I love it I can make fun dances and videos with the app and I can see all my friends do the same.Im just a little scared bc I feel like TikTok is watching me If u use the filter that u can write with sorry for bad explaining And zoom in u will be able to see somewhere where u are at that time which is VERY scary.The app also puts people down with nasty rude comments on posts but obviously the app cant help that.Also there are a TON of pedofiles on the app and u HAVE to be carefulDont post videos in revealing clothes EVEN if ur acc is PRIVATE bc people u do not know can STILL somehow watch them.Also, the age restricment is there for a reason Do not download the app if u are younger bc the app does use rude words in sounds. With that said, if ur thinking about downloading TikTok be wear of the Karens And pls be wear of what I said"
I AM SO DONE WITH UR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES. i cannot even express HOW ANNOYING it is getting banned every 5 seconds for nothing. i made a NORMAL TIK TOK JUST OF MY FACE. OF MY FACE singing a completely appropriate song and my account got banned for harassment and bullying.IM SO DONE. earlier today my other account got PERMANENTLY BANNED for us doing a dance. everybody fully clothed. i am unbelievably annoyed and i feel like i cant post anything unless its a video of the wall. that would even get taken down. please change this IMMEDIATELY before i get banned again. also tik tok needs to learn the difference between a bathing suit and no clothes. and i know multiple people have this issue too. i want my account and all my data back now please and thank you
DONT DONLOAD. THIS APP WATCHES YOU OT SCANS YOUR FACE AND IT LOOKS THOUR YOUR PHONE
"Newest update. This app is already a privacy travesty, but condensing the dms and notifications was probably the worst decision made yet. the original notification layout was fine and now i cant find any alerts. put back the old UI"
Offensive. I dont like the app because its offensive and also you dont get the privacy because any one can make fun of you
"Tiktok . Tiktok now is so much better than when it was musically, they have so many trends and challenges that you will never get bored , and theres new dances everyday and trends every week and especially in this quarantine its very boring and tiktok is keeping me busy. The app I have used the most is tiktok during this pandemic ,  it has different features which are funny , cute , pretty or scary and what I like is that you can save them . I love the privacy settings that tiktok has and I like that you can put your hearted vids on private and you can save your videos to drafts if you dont want to post them . I like that you can put hashtags but the only thing that I dont like is that some of the songs that you want to use might not work because you live in a different country or state . And I like that when you first sign in they ask you what content you prefer , and I like that you can put your account on private or change your videos so only your followers can see . I love it , and I love that people make slinks to some of the songs . Its amazing I highly recommend"
Worst. Worst app never use leaks your privacy and making people transgender
Tik tok on the clock. My favourite part about tiktok is when the communists use the app to steal your data
I  it. The App has been very useful for my entertainment and personal progress 
I  it. The App has been very useful for my entertainment and personal progress
"trash trash trash trash trash. TikTok has a toxic community, steals songs, has taken very private information illegally and sending it to China. Overall, tiktok is "
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. A recent study done on this app has revealed after downloading the app ALL of your private data is sent to a server in China.All of your passwords, key strokes(what you type) and location data gets stored in a server in China specifically ones owned by Alibaba or Tencent.It is in your best interest not to download this app or all of your personal data may be stolen"
Love this app it keeps me entertained. While this whole situation this app keeps me entertained and happy I always learn tricks and dances I recommend this this app is not a scam and doesnt take money off you nor does it ask for your personal details like bank account
Bye bye data. Want your data sold to the Chinese? Download this app
"Needs History Feature. This app desperately needs a history feature to track recently watched TikToks, even if its only for like the last 50 or so. Its too easy to accidentally refresh your whole feed while watching something and then its gone forever"
"INVASION OF PRIVACY?. Tell me HOW this app installed itself on my phone as an app clip that Im now unable to delete? When being sent a tiktok video via message (I have never, ever installed the app) - I used to see a preview and when I clicked the link, it would open in my default browser. Now I no longer see a preview, rather an open button that now automatically opens tiktok on my phone I have deleted the app clip but the open button still remains for any new video sent How is this even possible. HORRIBLE"
"One of the Worst apps ever. Ruined my mental health, it also tracks where you are and can look through your camera and basically hacks you. Never put your phone number in your tiktok account. DELETE TIKTOK AS SOON AS YOU CAN"
"TikTok Live-streams. Over all, TikTok is a fabulous app that deserves a lot of love, apart from the fact that you need 1000 followers to go live, I think it would relieve a lot of stress and hard work if you turned it to 100 followers instead, dont get me wrong, I enjoy using this app very much, its just my personal opinion"
fix your app. my analytics have been broken. how am i supposed to know what time to post if it says not enough data?
"Underrated Fantastic App. Even if you dont post publicly with TikTok, the app its self is perfect for making and editing videos for personal use Tones of filters and fun extras to change your face and bring life to any recording. Ive given this app 5 stars because I use it on a daily basis and post/interact with other users frequently and really enjoy it. However.. take away the public and interaction features.. Id still give the App a solid 4 stars"
Pls read tik tok. I dont know if its true but people are saying that when u have an account on it that they look through your photos and find where u live and apparently its not safe If you really are spying on people from outside of China and getting information please stop we never did anything to you and loads of innocent people have downloaded this so please I beg you stop I dont speak much Chinese but (thank you) and bye
"Cat. Long story short I had a cat that went missing and tiktok kept showing me videos of cats that looked like my missing cat. This isnt the first time something like this has happened. Take that how you will but Ive noticed when theres something upsetting going on in my life tiktok will show me videos to remind me of it. And they do this to everyone. In other words the app is designed to make you sad and dependent on it for that lil serotonin boost. They show you a pattern of videos, things that interest you and things that remind you of upsetting points in your life. Happy, sad, mad, whiplash of emotions in minutes. Think about your brains health. Great app for entertainment but in moderation, plus theyre very invasive of users privacy. Oh well we all agreed to this once we downloaded the app"
"Its a data gathering tool. Avoid at all costs. This is a data gathering tool, disguised as an app. Its come out of nowhere thanks to fake reviews and is now everywhere. Avoid"
"I dont like tiktok anymore. Delete tiktok because tiktok is racist,violent,animal abuse,harassment and some inappropriate stuff and tiktok is made out of China and China is trying to spy on you,be careful"
Tiktok. Hey tiktok can I have my account back it was lowkeyy.stop_  I did nothing wrong I was on private I did nothing wrong
"BEWARE. The creators are buying fake 5 star reviews to flood out the people exposing them for their invasion of privacy.The US government banned the app from any government issued phones. What other apps have been banned from government phones??? NONE. Nobody reads the terms of service or privacy policy, yet continues to use the app after people warn them of the issues. So many people are so simple minded and never question anything. Delete this app. Dont believe the invasion of privacy? Do your own research. The Chinese government is nothing like the one we know. They literally control any media coming in or out of their country. Dont blame their people, blame their government. I wouldnt be surprised if this review gets taken down, if not, itll just be flooded by fake low effort 5 star reviews.Youve been warned"
"Disgusting. I think I can speak for most of the population, tiktok is garbage.The amount of lgbtq crap being pushed is horrendous, and with them selling your information, wouldnt trust it a bit"
"This App was good until. Ive been using TikTok since its been called musical.ly. I started in 2018 and I still HAD the same account. It had all of my stuff in it and now I found out that I got banned? The rage I feel right now is unspeakable and Ive had to create a whole new account, no data and no trace of my videos from my old account. I have no idea why Ive been banned as Ive mentioned before"
"TikTok saved my life. The tips I have got from how to deal with emotions, make up hacks and cute doggies have made my year Best app Ive downloaded"
DUMB . Hi Im olivia I was 8 when I first got this app It was cool Until a random man started following meAnd said hi I was scared for I did Not know who this was.I brought my iPad to my mother and she deleted the appMy friend still had the app and said my account was stillThere I had to delete all the videos of of my iCloud and photos I do not like the fact that little kids can get roped in to theesType of things.Anyway lets stop talking about me let focus on the kids who Get this appI was watching the news with my family and hered about Kids showing there bodies and talking drugsAs a 9 Year old now I do not LIKE this as ALL People can compliment on your videos and ask personal Questions Sorry that it took so long Its gust so Much things to hate about ticktock Hope u All stay safe and delete this app immediatelyBye
Dear TikTok. TikTok is an amazing app it has showed me that I can do so many different things and I can now feel like I can open up to the world about my personal life and still feel safe and protected. I definitely recommend TikTok. Trust me you wont regret one bit of it. <3
Data usage. Am addicted to tik tok only complaint as I use mainly mobile data tiktok high definition vids eats my data please tik tik do like you tube does so you select quality of vids to lower data usage
"permanent ban for nothing and ignoring illegal activities. good app but my account is getting permanently banned for no reason no warning 6 times. everyone of my 5 accounts were banned some i dont even use. ive reached out to tik tok and they do nothing, all my data requests expire and i cant get my data back. lets not forget the being banned for NO reason at all. tik tok please fix this issue and there has been death threats, child predators, pornography bots, scammers, and even accounts selling cp how messed up is that? these accounts are not dealt with and never banned thats so messed up, come on tik tik you ban random people and ignore illegal activities. tiktok fix this please and i want my account back"
"Our privacy settings. The app is amazing but can u please not choose who can duet our videos and save them my friends wanna duet my videos and save them so can u not do that , we can turn it off if we dont like people duetting it and saving it but I want my duets back on please"
"The best app ever. This app is my most used and favourite app on my phone Some videos r slightly inappropriate but that is why there is an age limit. I spend the majority of the time when I go on my phone on TikTok, I mainly watch videos but I enjoy making videos too. If you have any concerns on privacy bases then you dont need to have them. This is because you can have a private account and only the people you accept can see the videos you post. It is also another way to see people with a huge span of talent Also is a nice way to keep connected with others.As an all over review it is AMAZING"
Improve. Hey I love TikTok so much but... it would make the app 10 times better for everyone to go live not just people with 1000 fans... I only have 64 and I have a private account and I dont know 1000 people Please consider this request
This app spys on u. This app is a spying app from the Chinese government
Privacy issue. Who thought to allow a bunch of 13 year olds on an app dance and throw themselves out to the rest of the internet? One if the biggest and most stupid decisions ever made
PRETTY BAD. Ok I get it my title is dramatic but tiktok has a lot of bullying and I was made to spy on people that is why I deleted it If you are over 14 it is okay
"Perfecto. I think its a wonderful app, I was wondering if you could go live without data"
Thanks China. Track my information I dont care this app is pure trash and I LOVE IT
"Chinese owned. Owned by china, harvests your data, and steals music without permission"
Terrible. I dont recommend at all. It wastes your personal data. Even on WiFi I found that it also bans account for no reason. I have a comment about someones eyes( a nice one) and I got banned for inappropriate contentThats why I dont recommend
AWFUL. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT GET THIS APP IT HAS STOLEN MY DATA PLEASE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES I DID
"So entertaining. Despite issues with contact information, most apps have access to some, its really a great app to connect with a community of content creators"
Good . I love this app but they use your data and they can do anything with your videos so please be careful 
Bad app. Taking up all my data for no reason
Spy. I am not risking my privacy and valuables
"Why?. Okay... Tiktok has somehow become racist Non Black people on this app have decided that bringing back racism is okay, the videos get reported but they stay up and its the people of colours video that gets taken down? Explain to me a black person, how that is far in anyway? Tiktok leaves up the hateful stuff but takes down the videos of people defending the black community? At this point this App has become to much, I might consider deleting my accounts and the app The non blacks  have been dropping the hard r, and the word it self and thats okay? Every where I look theres probably a video of a non black dude telling blacks  to go pick Cotten  or  your a slave  LIKE how is that far, and the fact that this people behind this app do absolutely nothing to stop it is incredible When I first downloaded this app ( in 2018 ) it was great but slowly it got worse and worse I dont understand how yall can just let this happen Many black creators of addressed this on the app but their videos get taken DOWN The people behind this app NEED to go through and deleted theses racists accounts Your allowing them to say racial SLARS I rest my case"
Deadly app. This app is just deadly bro. It makes me want to use up all my data in one night. I send tik toks to everyone that i think it relates to or whk would enjoy it
Brilliant app just one thing. Tiktok is an amazing app its just that it needs data I get data every month and when I watch tiktok it wastes it
I like butI think It need some changes . First one the The age you say this app is for 13+ but all the seven year olds on this app doing crazy stuff and you guys dont do anything about it Second the privacy guidelines are so unnecessary and annoying it wont even let me duet anybodys videos anymore and now only my my friends can comment on my videos which is boring I cant even recommend videos I mean I get you dont want anybody to get hate but dont you think this is a little overboard I mean not letting anybody recommend videos is  just crazy and my third reason the racism so many rude white people hate on black creators and TikTok doesnt do anything about it which makes me upset my fourth and final reason the  inappropriate content on the app ive seen so many inappropriate things and theyre still up its disgusting and this inappropriate stuff is getting so many views when its NEEDS to be taken down and Im scared that kids will imitate the same thing that they see just for a couple of likes come on TikTok get your game up but other than that I think the app is pretty good just try your best to not keep these videos up have a blessed day
"I NEED HELP PLEASE. **CUSTOMER SERVICE WONT ANSWER ME ITS BEEN A MONTH**When I log in on the tiktok app, on any phone or safari source it works fine, when I log in on my iPhones tiktok app it says that Im suspended from multiple violations of community guidelines or that Im permanently banned. I never posted and I only used tiktok to watch photography stuff so nothing rude was even said or anything of that sort. I have restarted my iPhone, updated it and the app. Cleared all information of the app off my phone and re-download it it a million times. Still I am not able to access my account. I cant even make a new one on my tiktok app. Someone help me out"
DONT GET THIS APP. Tik tok is SPYING on our data from our iphones I REPEAT TIK TOK IS SPYING do nit get under any circumstances
"Chinese Spying App. Do not download this app. It copies everything on your clipboard, passwords included. It supports the Chinese Government and their ethnic genocide of the Uighurs. Lots of soft propaganda is promoted on this app"
Love this app. This app is great for finding out info and watching videos about things I love
Please dont use this app. Tik tok have been shadowbanning BLM tik toks and the app is really toxic  Ive seen innocent black people being called the n word for posting BLM videos and also I reported a racist woman and nothing was done. Also there are rumours that you sell our information and stuff so if you really wanna download this then dont say I didnt warn ya
"Please give me a new account. Tuition is great I love it and it is really entertaining but I wish that I can make videos to but apparently I didnt follow the guidelines and so now I am permanently banned for nothing they said for me to download data but I cant, understanding that i have and iPhone 6 so please stop this nonsense because i didnt break the guidelines thank you"
Garbage. Tik Tok is even worse than climate change. Its bad because its owners are the Chinese and what they do I store data on you to violate your privacy. Pay attention sheep and when the next trend comes leave before you lose your life to this app
TIK TOK. Hey so heres the tea on the tok... I LOVE the idea of tik tok but the reason all my friends family and myself have deleted this app is because there are so many dangers that surround the aps privacy settings if you are considering this app for your kids make sure youre privacy setting are on the max and really really monitor it safely
". Steals your data, and toxic and h0moph0b1c"
"Delete this app. Delete this app, this app steals your information and watches you threw your camera, it can also hear you"
"Suddenly app crashed. Yesterday i.e. November 1,2021 my app said content not available due to privacy policy of India. By the way I am in Canada from last 11 months and it was working fine till now. My account is lost and I am not able to reset it again by any means"
"Dangerous. PLEASE SCREENSHOT &amp; SHARE THIS REVIEW BEFORE IT&#39;S DELETED BY TIKTOK. Don&#39;t download tiktok. Not only it&#39;s toxic but it&#39;s gold for pedophiles. Young girls are sexualizing themselves on there and people are ENCOURAGING THAT. Tiktok is owned by China, and in China, there are no privacy laws. They save ALL your information, even when you&#39;re not on the app, and in one click they could sell it to anyone or make it public.They&#39;re racist. During the BLM movement they have posted a (black) girl&#39;s drafts without her permission and she can&#39;t delete them.Tiktok hides videos of disabled, POC, poor and people who don&#39;t look blonde and skinny from the FYP.Your first video will get more likes to make you want to continue posting, but your other videos will probably flop, if you don&#39;t look &#34;perfect&#34;.Tiktok deletes 1 star reviews. Please please screenshot &amp; share, in case this review would be deleted"
Tiktok is good BUT. Tiktok is addictive Is uses a bunch of dataIt gets emotionally attached to youI need to delete tiktok because its using 133GB right now but I really dont want to because Ive become emotionally attached to the app and have so many videos and memories on tiktok I have 2000+ drafts and about 3000+ videos I dont want to lose them all.Comment to app creator- make your app us less data please
"Is This Broken?. When I downloaded tiktok I was expecting an app full of exciting, colourful and creative people. This is what I got. However when I tried to create my own account I was told I was not old enough when the age limit in the App Store was 12+ and I am above 12 years of age. After trying a few times, I tested to see whether I was genuinely to young or there was a glitch. I stated that I was born in 1973, well above the age limit and it said I was not old enough. I then spun the wheel all the way back to 1900 which would be 120years old And I was apparently not old enough. I wrote 4 complaints and a review that would not send in the last 48 hours and nothing has been done to fix the issue or contact me. So whilst the other app users are very interesting and the content is great the management of the app is very very poor and has left me increasingly frustrated. I saw this email as the only way to reach out to someone and ask for help. Finally, I have found a lot of hate in this app particularly towards the lgbtq+ and black community so if you want to continue to make money (and sell our data *cough cough*) please start policing better and improve your community guide lines"
"Great app but rumours. So, I love Tik Tok so much its like the best app on my phone I love how its like vine and its so entertaining I just love it But there are some rumours that Tik Tok is stealing your personal information and giving it to the government or something :/"
". TikTok is an amazing app to express yourself, learn new dances , share your story, meet new people and most of all have fun I have been on the app since it was musically and I definitely preferred it like that  But in general I love the app, although I have heard it can track your ip address and hack your phone but Im ok at the moment and will continue to use the app, also please stop taking down peoples videos for no reason"
"Tiktok. Tiktok is a wonderful app which inspires you to make amazing videos.As well as watching your friends or idols tiktoks you can also create trendy artistic or dancing videos. You dont have to use your own original sound you can just click on a CD to use different encaging songs or voiceovers.If you dont want your account to be public than just make it private, that way only your followers can view your tiktoks. Other people have to have permission by you for them to follow you. If you create a video, you get to decide who can share, comment or view.Its so fun and cool that you can chat and message your friends, due to your privacy settings. Your able to Send videos or smiley faces to them, which is super fun. You can Grow youre tiktok account if you want or just keep simple you dont have to make videos to have an account. Accounts  can comment, like, share, duet and lots more things with tiktok videos You have a FYP (for you page) and a following page. You can search for sounds, accounts, videos and hashtags and you have a plus sight where you create videos. An inbox, which tells you who followed, liked, messages, duet, shared or commented on your videos. And has your account page where you can edit bio, add Instagram or YouTube, rename your account username or even retake your account picture.But the most important part of tiktoks is enjoying and having fun making and watching tiktok&#39;s. I like to think of tiktok has a mini Instagram. Please purchase this free great loving app"
"Spyware. TikTok is well known spyware. Furthermore, its developed by a Chinese company, and so is obligated to help its government push their sociopolitical views.This can be seen by their active censoring of PoC, LGBT content creators, etc.And Chinas political views include religious oppression, industrial espionage, and rounding up minorities into internment camps.Please dont give up your privacy to support an authoritarian regime"
Why. Don&#39;t download this because the Chinese government exists and if your stupid enough to not listen the American government wanted to ban it from the USA so no one would get there information stolen but of course people would complain so the government would have to bring it back because of democracy. google it
I think someone has hacked into my account. It has happened to me twice and I have got permanently banned.Can you pls track down the hacker pls TikTok Australia?
"Mama. Been loving the app Other than the stupid guidelines it has for us adults, but other than that TT should start showing us who is sharing our videos. Not how many people. I think that is a privacy concern for myself and others, not the person sharing it"
age. its not letting me fix my age..so now my privacy settings are restricted. i reported a problem and still didnt get a reply back. i cant send messages or share videos on there anymore and you can only comment on my video if we're friends
Naee. My is not updating and theres alot of adds and you have to use all your data when you want to do a tiktok
Dont download. I downloaded this app last year after it was on my phone I notice chinese writing a were all over my phone when I was texting someone on my iPhone it was in Chinese.  When I was using notepad it was in chinese this app is from China and is spyware stealing your personal information good luck with this garbage
TikTok spys on you. Spys
Data. It uses to much data
"Terrible App. This app is a communist red Chinese spy app that steals your information, its banned on US military bases for good reason"
Love tiktok. Its an app where you can be your self and have your own personal for you page and account I recommend it to you if you have free time or just bored. 10/10
"Im addicted. I have got an account on TikTok which is private but you can make so many awesome videos on this incredible app that I am addicted to you can look at funny videos,watch dances,do new trends and loads more I definitely recommend getting this app it is incredible"
"I heard whats happening. Had no other choice but to delete, dont want my information to be stolen. Better safe than sorry"
Tiktok is the worst app ever Ive used. Tiktok is stealing our data please ban tiktok from Pakistan
TikTok. Thank you for this beautiful app but stop spying on people like me and make everyone TikTok famous
Chinese spy app. This app spys on you and sends everything to the CCP
Worst app ever. This is the worst app ever you dont get any privacy DO NOT GET THIS APP WASTE OF TIME
Data thief. Tik tok steals a lot of your personal data without your consent so a big 1 star from me since I cant rate it 0 stars. If I could I would
Dont download. Dont download this app it gose over alll if you info and stuff like where you love and you phone number
. Tik tok is all I could dream for. No ads yeah you do need WiFi but its okay. You can make content and watch other peoples content. You can pick witch content you want to watch. You can go live after 1k followers your account can be private or public Love so get it now
Evil. Stop stealing my data you bloodsuckers
Hi. Yall are the most incredible people I just wanna ask if I can get verified on TikTok and if you can just go send me a package I love you and yall are the best app people
Bad app. Terrible steals data
I dont like it. I dont like how we need wifi or data to tiktok like please change that and I have only 30 followers and I cant go live please make it to be like instagram you can go like even if you have 1 fan
TikTok. TikTok is a really good app you create music videos and watch other people and if you dont want anybody to watch you and you just want your friends to you can put your account on private 
I like it a lot but. There is a lot of inappropriate content and apparently you make this app to spy on us so my parents made me delete it and Im heartbroken so maybe if anything is inappropriate before people post if there may be anything inappropriate send a thing saying is this appropriate? Should you be posting this?
"Dumb. This app is terrible and innapropriate It sells your info to China, and bad reviews are deleted. My last review was also deleted"
TIKTOK. TikTok need to let people write as much as they want and should stop saying TAKE A BREAK YOU ARE TAPPING TO FAST OR TAKE A BREAK YOU ARE COMMENTING TO FAST And it should work without data and internet
One star. It sends personal information from your phone back to China. The company that owns tik tok works with the Chinese government to centralise data about people
Good but. Apparently they steal info on you and sell it
It's good but. TikTok is a Tracking app so don't allow it to show were you are  and there are a lot of people hating on people and kids have it and it's just not a good app for kids if u do then u need to check the app bc they could get hate or post inappropriate videos and it's just not good
Tik tok. Get off of TickTock theyre stealing your information get off of it this is like the worst app ever its terrible get off of it
"Pls read this. I love tiktok although some things are so stupid. Random videos  get taken down but they took months to take down a child nudity video Another thing is karens on the app, now this is not the creators fault I am just pointing it out. Karens always are so pathetic on vids encluding swearing and dirty jokes, saying theres kids on this app ok and?? They shouldn't been on this app so they should leave? This app is 13+ only Although again this isnt the creators fault ,parents should check their kids devices to prevent them from being on the app Another issue is online dating and dms people are constantly getting messages from creeps asking rude and inappropriate things that are personal to them Its so dangerous and a lesson that needs to be taught is dont talk to online strangers because u dont know what they are capable of. Thats all I have to say for now. Thanks for reading xx"
"Bad app. Dont like it, very bad app , the CCP will steal all ur info"
TikTok causes retardation in todays society. Anyone who downloads TikTok will be retarded later in life. DO NOT GET THIS APP. The Chinese government spies on you through this
"TikTok. TikTok is an amazing app you can have many accounts and the good thing is, is that you can hardly get hacked unlike any other app. I really like it and you post videos of many entertainment things and you can get A LOT of views or you can get hardly any views. You can have followers and you can follow other people that you find supportive and bold for your opinion. I recommend this app for 7+ because there is children on the app that are like 5 but its a seven plus up for sure, I mean most of the content is meant for young people anyway because they knew they were gonna be on the app anyway. The thing is, is that if you are 7-10 you need an adult to make your accounts or account because of the date and make sure that you account is private so no creepy old mean or anyone you dont know can see your videos. All you have to do is sign up and its really easy"
Tiktok. Well its okay but really you need to allow it to have access to photos and microphone to make a video like what if you had private things in there and i do not trust tiktok not to hack me well yeah i have friends that use tiktok but they use it a bit to long at a time but it doesnt mean you have to critise this app this is just my personal thoughes okay thank you
"Chinese spying app. Dont let anyone download this app, for your safety"
"Good I think so far. I have a public and a private acc. (If u want u can follow me at @peacful_human ) so personally I think the app is great. But I cant seem to log back into one of my accs, I had all the info right it just wouldnt lemme. I like the filters, keep adding more"
Its a scam. They spy on you and sell all your data for money and they are chinese
One of the worst social media apps that has been created yet. It not only has a retorted fan base but also steals your data. I wish there was an option to rate this 0 stars
Chinese spyware. Download this if you like your personal details going to the CCP
Bad app. It takes more information in the background than needed and sends to servers in China
"Its a weird app, not the people on it but the creators. Sure its fun scrolling through tik tok at 5 in the morning and seeing so many different people but dont you think its a bit weird that it took tik tok 4 hours to take down a livestream of someone hanging themselves? Or that the creator of tik tok has admitted to taking data from our phones meaning they can see what we search who we text etc. Its a really cool app and its so fun to be on but its also really shady"
Boycott TikTok. Reasons to boycott:1. Its owned by the Chinese. They are currently carrying out a genocide of Uighur Muslims in east Turkestan (which they have renamed to Xinjang). 2. Its a terrible app and promotes immodesty and degenerate behaviour. 3.  The Chinese are currently farming your data and monitoring all kinds of activity on your phone (see Wire article)
"TikTok Review. I love TikTok It is hilarious, heart warming, heart breaking, inspiring, restores your faith in mankind. With all of that being said, please dont be the EVIL HACKER FROM CHINA that everyone says will steal all of our lives, money, personal info, even down to our prayers I actually deleted my first account because my friends were so adamant about all of that being true About a month went by and I created another account..couldnt take it..missed all the entertainment "
Cool. Cool app use a lot of data lol
Dont download. This app is used by the Chinese communist party to spy on you
TikTok. 10/10 better than YouTube but a bit annoying that it steals your info apparently and if it does then thats annoying but its still one of if not the best app on the App Store
Nopeeee. They steal all of your personal information
Pure addiction. Warning dont get one if you want a normal life or much privacy.  It takes hours out of your life.  Made some amazing friends too.  Warning: TikTok are very unresponsive
"Privacy. Great because you can have a private account and still have school friends follow you with your permission Safe, fun, childfriendly"
Hypocritical and Irresponsible. This app is capable of deleting accounts of people who do nothing wrong in their videos. However they do NOTHING about the thousands of spam accounts made by robots that write comments on posts while having a malicious link on their account that causes users to get hacked. Thanks for protecting us more from good content than hackers
"tik tok should be deleted. delete this app stealing data and is racist, sexist and homophobic"
Cant sign back in. No way I got hacked. I think you guys are just selling our data. Cant wait till this app is deleted
Use to much data. This is the best app ever. But the only thing is that it wastes a lot of data so maybe can you make tick tock go offline to so you can watch it any were
"Communicating. There is a great way to communicate in TikTok,there are loads of features you can use such as: comment sections,lives and direct messages. There are even privacy settings that you can turn on to make sure your child is save"
Hacking. Do you guys stalk are phones and stuff its a dangerous app and you stalk us its not fun but this app is fun :) just stop stalkinb us:(
China owns TikTok. Its okay but China is spying on us
Spyware. Why does tik tok keep spying on me by accessing my clipboard contents?
Download TikTok now. I love TikTok so much I spend every day on it even if we r busy I find away to watch it for at least 5 mins I love how you can make a private account to its safe and much easier for you and who can follow you You can follow friends and text in there either in the comments or in ur own conversation with them and you can share funny videos If I had to choose out of TikTok and all the games on my phone I would choose TikTok Its a lovely way to make friends make funny videos make your own soundIn the end if your still reading this I just want to say you should download it me and my friends have it and we love it Thanks for reading and remember download TikTok
"Great app. This is a wonderful app to just document whats going in, to be funny, and to have a personal platform"
Waste of time. The reason why this is a waste of time because the Chinese government tracks your data on it and also all you do is scroll its really stupid
Hello. I miss when the data showed on the TikToks on the for you page. Like when the creator posted them and then it would show the date
Good but bad. I give Tiktok 3/5 because I use tiktok a lot you know its something thats vey addicting but you know because I use it so much on a regular basis my phone screen just freezes and its really annoying tiktok uses a lot and I mean a lot of your data and sometimes out of the blue it takes me off the app now I know its not the device Im using currently but if it is then it would sbe a 3 mainly because the people on and there are loads of types of people but the ones on tiktok arent pleasing now the age is 12+ but I recommend you only use the app if you are 15+ but its totally your choice you don&#39;t need to be 15+ but its the age I recommend now back to the start Ive used it for more than a year now and it freezes so much my inbox is frozen like I cant message or type anyone I still can scroll through tiktok but I cant talk to my friends because its frozen thankyou very much for wasting your time into mine to read my letter and I really hope you take the things i have said very deeply but its your choice if you dont want to  :) bye
"Big Blackfoot. tik tok has valuable information, no negative comments, people, privacy"
Tiktok. 10/10 spying
Tracker. This game tracks your location It is not a safe app
Unban my account. Tiktok cant be trusted. I trusted tiktok with a lot of my personal videos. I have never violated community guidlines and I woke up almost a week ago with my account permanently banned. All my sentimental videos gone with it. And tiktok refuses to tell me what I did to get banned. Many other people have had this problem as well. It is clear that it is a problem with this company. Please unban my account. The username is walrusrat
"Chinese Communist Party Spy device. The communist party shouldnt govern China, Taiwan is the real China, the xing dynasty is Taiwan and the xing owned Chinas land. You engaged in a civil war after Japanese attacks. This was the only reason you won. The apps good but is taking your data and selling it, boosting the power of this horrible evil dictatorship which has made holocausts of its people. The suffering of Chinese people must stop. Do not download to savepeople tortured by this communist reigime"
"Thank you. Hello My name is Mario Reyes, I want to thank you for all the hard work that you have done to get the app up and running with all the amount of Data that you have to deal with. I am guessing that sometimes has to be challenging. My experience with tiktok has being awesome, Its a very friendly app. Easy to navigate and use. I have made really good friends in the app. And I cant thank you enough for that. What do I need to do to get Verified? I certainly would love to do that. Thanks"
Incredible. TikTok has been an incredible place for me to showcase my content. The app is fair and very user friendly. Promotions are tailored towards specific things like website clicks or followers which is essential for content creators looking to promote their material. I look forward to using TikTok for many years
"Chinese spyware. Do not download, this app is owned by the ccp. Once downloaded your device will be used as a data farm for China"
. TikTok is a fun app but the only thing is that why use it to spy?  I cant have TikTok anymore
My video. My TikTok video was on there saying like my favourite colour and that and then it got taken down because it was personal info apparently but. One of my friends TikToks. Has Literally the town she lives in and she has a public account and its not been taken down and mine is privete so.. but apart from that its very good the filters are good but sometimes I cant find the filter I want lol
I have questions. R u spying on me or not? also there are so many horrible comments when people speak up about ra*e or anything so... however tiktok is an amazing app however its glitchy on my iPhone (6)
Amazing. I am addicted to this app Is amazing  I think you should get it (Uses a lot of data)
CCP spying application. Nearly as bad as Facebook
"TikTok. TikTok is an amazing app I would recommend to anyone over the age of 12 Its creative in so many different ways You can make your own videos, follow other creators, like other peoples content by clicking the heart on their video, use audios from your favourite songs and much more I feature I love about this app is that you can favourite hashtags, audios, videos and effects Theres something on there for everyone, gaming, comedy, animating and a lot more. I also love how if you follow someone and they follow you back, you can privately chat with them by pressing the message button on their account Another thing I love about this app is that you can have public and private accounts. On a public account people can easily find your videos, on the for you page, on audios, hashtags etc. Private accounts give you the right amount of privacy you need, somebody will send you a follow request and you can accept it if youd like them to see youre content, you dont come up on the fyp. Another feature I love about a TikTok is that you can put comments on avideo and other people can reply to them and like them. The creator of the video can also reply to your comment with a video. And I think that just about covers what TikTok is"
"Tiktok. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEYconsidered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
"BAN TIKTOK. The developers of this app steal peoples information and identity to sell to Chinese companies. This app has been spying on little kids. The average TikTok users age is 8-20, little kids use this app and, I will say it, there are things that kids SHOULD NOT be seeing. (Ive read about this mostly in the news tho) Theres all kinds of bad things below the surface about this app that people dont see, if your curious, search it up. I deleted this app years ago, but Ive also been hearing about how its censoring the BLM movement and removing black/LGBT creators from the for you page but still having racist and homophobic videos and hate speeches and I just want to say that is disgusting, and it should NOT be happening. America has already banned tiktok, Canada should be next Do NOT let your kids get this app GET TIKTOK BANNED FROM THE APP STORE Whos with me? #BanTikTok #UninstallTikTok"
"Do not get. The Chinese government owns half of it and exploits your data and privacy. They can see things like, your recent searches on Safari, and where youve been last in maps. Do Not Get"
"Great but. It is an amazing app but there has been rumours about the app stealing data, I dont really care about it but you dont want to take any risks thats fine I would totally recommend it if you are bored in lockdown"
The Chinese Government are spying on you. The Government are lizard people
"Tiktok is a racist fatphobic app. Tiktok deletes videos of coloured, fat people. This app is racist and puts white people in favour. As well as this they allow racist videos to be posted to the community and they refuse to delete it. This app also takes your data and sells it. Don&#39;t download it"
Chinese government. If I wanted the Chinese government to steal my info I would buy a pet bird
really unsafe and toxic. it is really toxic people have tried to kill themselves after getting hate on this app. do not install this app it takes your data and encourages self harming. it is racist and very addictive which is very bad for you. DO NOT INSTALL
"Dont Believe The Hype. I was once a true fan but now that ive used it, They govern everything, they put on audios & effects smog/smoke for certain crowds then punish for using them especially if creative. There is a dbl standard between Marijuana n Alcohol both legal substances in most parts also they dictate to you what they deem fit no matter the effort put in. & Unless your gonna be a young teen girl shaking her damn near naked body, already famous, they only allow your videos to go out to only a small number of viewers. If you make a mistake in typing or in your video once posted no way to correct it. the option is not there. Very hokey on the judgemental part of tiktok. Make a private account they do sell the info to third party sites I am a victim of this check out urlebird.com a site where i have no control on my content once there. And still they punish me, w removals & no chance at replying? Careful"
3 stars. Hi I have rated TikTok with 3 stars. TikTok is an amazing app which is very user friendly and keeps you entertained however I have been trying for months to contact TikTok. I had requested my data to see why TikTok was setting restrictions on my account and then had seen that there was no date of birth officially set for some reason And I have been trying to get in touch for a very long time with them to help me sort out this issue but they just dont respond. So if they could improve there communication with there users I think this would benefit many who also are dealing with similar problems
Toxic Environment & Data Stealing. The algorithm keeps trying to feed me the same toxic narrative on the fyp. I have to scroll through the fyp for so long before I see anything thats actually catered to my interests. Tags are useless at this point because their just filled with irrelevant videos using the tag being its popular. I deleted it a month ago and I have to say Ive been a much happier person since. Dont get me started on the data you need to give up
ew. i hate this app it tracks ur data its so creepy
LET US USE PHONE NUMBERS AND EMAILS MORE THE ONCE. i delete the app and reinstalled it cause i thought the glitch was a problem with my tikok and when i went to log in it said password was wrong even-though nobody hacked onto it and i didnt change my pass so i went on my ipad which had the same acc on it and went to put my phone number in so i could get back it said  phone number already has been used and now i cant get back in cause you wont let us use the same phone numbers again what type of app are u
Terrible app. TikTok has a personal vendetta against anything patriotic because this app is made by the Chinese communist party to steal data from its users and censor free speech. Being the fact its owned and controlled by a communist regime they do not tolerate anything that goes against their personal beliefs this is not an app for freedom loving Americans or people who like to express their personal beliefs or feelings because if you dont match the agenda they have they will censor you and block your interaction with the community I personally was shadow banned and restricted for trying to expose this as well as spread awareness. I believe anyone and everyone has a right to express themselves in any means so long as its not illegal or overly explicit (there are many websites for that) but TikTok does not it is a breeding ground for hate and child exploitation as well two things I dont agree with but TikTok does it seems
"Very much adequate. TikTok is literally my entire life, I am completely serious when I tell you that without TikTok I literally would not know what to do with my life. TikTok is the best app in the entire world and its really just a whole experience that you have to see to understand. It is incredible. 1000/10 would use 24 hours a day everyday. Forever "
"I LOVE TikTok :). It is a great app for a day off and to relax.There is so many different videos that WILL suit your preference. You can also make videos for a laugh with your friends. There is also a setting that you can let your child use and you can keep track of it It is also inspiring for the other children to look up at the amazing content creators such as Charli and Addison. But there is some trolls that are a bit rude on the app being racist and being sexist etc. What I love about TikTok is that you can express who you are as a person and be yourself and not to hide from anyone. And if you dont want random strangers watching your videos there is a privacy setting which makes your account private so the people that you accept to follow you they can watch your videos. You can also have privacy settings on your videos like: only me can see this, only my friends can see this all of my followers or everyone on the app. If someone is being rude to you, you can report them or block them so they wont interfere with you again. There is so many good reasons to download TikTok and so little negative things. God bless you"
This app has too many bad words. My mom said that I can spy on you dont get
Unban my account. Tiktok cant be trusted. I trusted tiktok with a lot of my personal videos. I have never violated community guidlines and I woke up today with my account permanently banned. All my sentimental videos gone with it. And tiktok refuses to tell me what I did to get banned. Many other people have had this problem as well. It is clear that it is a problem with this company. Please unban my account. The username is walrusrat
aight. in the words of konekokitten:tiktok: its either your least favourite or most favourite way to have all of your personal info sold to China
"Great app but a big problem. I love this because theres great videos and trends but there is a very big problem. That problem is that it wastest way too much data and i mean way too much so can you put down the data usage from using tik tok because then i would be able to use it and have heaps of other data to do other things e.g. text on messager, etc. thank you for making this.    Kind regards sally"
Entertaining & Information. Great app for entertainment and passing time with a great amount of valuable information on many topics
"one complaint. right i love tiktok as much as the next guy. but my phone just updated and all of a sudden all i can see when i check notifs is my inbox, but i dont use the message feature so i dont need that, you need to now wait untill you get a new notification for a tab to come up where you can see the notifications part but once you leave that tab to get back to it you need another notification? this is really annoying to me because i just want to read my notifications when i please and i dont even use the inbox. im praying they change this back"
Tik Tok is very inappropriate. Ive had this app since musically Ive had it for years but its changed a lot many many kids have it when there like 7 8 and its not good for any kids I think its very dangerous Ive not got it no more because it is very very unsafe when I first got it I thought it was amazing and so fun but I found out that ppl r on there that shouldnt and do stuff thats very inappropriate and just something that someone young does not want to see it is also very rude. Many people get hate or racism and many ppl being bullies and ppl saying u shouldnt be this and that and i just dont like that stuff. People think its a joke but they take it way to far also there is a lot of people who pretend to be like someone young but there acc a weirdo who does weird stuff many people thinks its an amazing good app but its rlly dangerous and I think u shouldnt rlly have it and tik Tok should just be banned. I have also told a lot of my friends that they shouldnt have it some of my friends have deleted it but some of my friends said its fine and Im just gonna keep it but they shouldnt. Also if you dont want tik Tok no more then dont just log out of it bc you put all ur private and personal stuff to make an account so then if u dont delete ur acc then ppl can hack into ur account and find where you live and all ur number so if u want to delete ur account then u have to go on mange my account then scroll down and then it will say delete account press onto that and say send me a code and it will send you a picture when it has sent you a code then all u have to do is type that code in and press done and then you log out after you have done that and then delete tik Tok and then ur acc has gone. So yeah it has also been called very nasty and inappropriate names so I Think you should just delete it
Tik. Every Parent listen my son has had this app for 7 months you can t get in trouble you can log into there account and see what they do on there account unless your child has search something inappropriate take it away if someone follows them that is a grown up male there account private dont check there account every hour respect there privacy
Yes. Good app if your data has already been sold
Love this app but it can also be annoying. I love this app and all buy it just used to much data it used 19 of my 64 gigs in a year
Great app. I dont care that China taking my information dont be afraid of everything
TikTok review. TikTok is a great app but you can be there all day just watching your phone thats why I set time limits I recommend downloading
Horrible. This app used to be so fun but it became toxic and filled with straight men dancing. Tiktok steals your data (its been proven) and they say they support blm but they dont. People say Charli ruined it but shes honestly the one thing I like about this app. Im deleting today and I wont be downloading it again
"Its just bad. TikTok has a toxic community, steals songs, has taken very private information illegally and sending it to China. Overall, tiktok is "
Trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Reddit is WAY better. O and btw nice job low key selling kids data to tictok. 
This app has ruined my childhood and now I will want to die. This app has ruined my life it is nothing but drama the app steals your info and bullys you I hate it I hate my life
A very good app. This app has a very good idea of how they show there data and I really like scrolling through my for you page for hours thank you for changing my life tiktok From Ned Horton
"I wish I could do a zero star. Tick tock tracks ur address and takes all your information on ur electronic and it makes u feel very bad about ur self when I had tick tock,on the for u page it was showing me random stuff that r sometimes inappropriate and I dont even Watch it.it is a scam and doesnt give u privacy to ur electronic this is the worst app evereven when they respond to our feedback, they just write the same thing if it is good feed back, they will just say thank u.im 9 and even 12 year olds it is bad for u"
"I love/this app. I love watching the videos on here and Ive met and becomes friends with some great people. But tiktok you need to clean up your act, the amount of disrespect disgustingly rude and personal insults that go on daily is getting out of control. It feels a bit like tik tok lost its way and left the funny uplifting playful happy content behind. You need to find it again . Get back in the right lane"
DELETE TIKTOK. So yes this is great for showing off creativity but there are kids as young as five years old on it which is incredibly young for some of the content available with out being taken down there needs to be an active moderation for content such as this and thats not even the worst of it your live feature allows for predators to take advantage of these kids and it has 3x the amount of predators as a usual game or site That is incredible for something like Tiktok as parents are allowing kids to use it do to its friendly approach to all ages with its creativity it allows for any thing to be made and this is only half of it this site is infested with perverts and it has 5x the amount of perverts than a usual site therefore IT HAS 8X THE AMOUNT OF DANGERS for younger audiences so this doesnt exclude teens from the endangered audiences or from the dangerous group of predators and perverts finally this is most definitely spyware from collecting info and selling it I dont care if there is terms but it doesnt specify where the info is sent and gathered and there is obviously leaker leaking this info to god knows who yet there is not a system to deal with malware inducing posts to my knowledge so if you are wondering why your app is being banned this is why
lol idc if they steal my info. @3amwaffles (idk why no one else is self promoting this is hilarious)
"Recent updates with no email or warning. Bhhhtch , please - I upload the Tt to find I cannot go on my own items without ( wait for this ) accepting the - I can look and our partners , but yet you will get greased with adds and other items .

Why???. I loved TikTok it  was incredible till it delete my account I hope 5hey see this my account was Xxtiger_robinsxX I would do anything for it to come back all my saved sounds and everything...
"TikTok sucks. Moderators are racist, sexist and only judge videos on personal feelings without following there own policies"
"Maybe you could fix this?. Hey, so I was just texting a friend of mine a while ago and I left to do some other stuff, when I got back, it was saying I couldnt text them because I needed to download my data for some reason, it never asked for me to do that before but I went to do so anyway, when I was going to download my data, it said it would be able to download in 4 days, what are you trying to do??? Please help"

"No. You destroyed the Notification Center in your new update, and you need to fix it if you want me to keep using this app. Messages and follower updates and likes need to be kept organized and separated so that users can observe their own analytics. Im absolutely disgusted by this update. Fix it if you want to continue harvesting my data. You have 24 hours"
This is called tikstupid. This app sucks steals your information dont install
I love TikTok. I love TikTok because the people who make the videos are so creative.what I dont like is the spam accounts that scam or hack your phone
"TikTok sucks. Moderators are racist, sexist and only judge videos on personal feelings without following proper policies"
Stop spreading bad things. Tik tok stands on number 1 in terms of spreading hate speech  This application is a threat to national security of any country. This could be a good source for china to get personal data info of any country. Good step india and USA to ban it .
New user. I am learning lots of new information. This app makes me laugh every single day
LOST 2 ACCS CAUSE OF UPDATE. so recently there has been a mew update on tiktok were when you try and log into your account it will ask you to verify your email. This up date is very bad as i used old emails that i now cant access so now i am locked out of 2 accs one with 15k follows and another with 12.5k follows PLEASE TAKE AWAY THIS UPDATE
Love it. Ive only recently really started using the app and Im loving it The content you can create is really good. I use the app for my business as well as my personal account. Its great for making how to videos
Keep tracking my data. Shows fake and discriminatory contents. Keep tracking my data. Shows fake and discriminatory contents. Always block the contents related to CORONA pandamic. Seems to be controlled by Chinese Government and not by any company.Shows offensive contents against women
TikTok. Its the app everyone wants to avoid but then eventually downloads it and watches it for four hours at a time
"Good but. There are old men that are targeting kids on tiktok, and its getting worse, they are hiding their faces and put a Chinese or Asian girl as their profile picture, and they put a link in their bio that show naked girls and others, so they like peoples comments in order for them to click that link, they will also have usernames like user826jaI7289ha28 or sexual_hookup.mex828. And I feel like they wanna traumatize kids who are on TikTok. (even though they shouldnt be.) But The only problem is, they hacked into my account AND my phone so that I couldnt download tiktok and deleted my original account. So I had to factory reset my phone"
My video. My TikTok video was on tehre saying like my favourite colour and that and then it got taken down because it was personal info apparently but. One of my friends TikToks. HasLiterally the town she lives in and she has a public account and its not been taken down and mine is privete so.. but apart from that its very good the filters are good but sometimes I cant find the filter I want lol
"TikTok amazing application with all in one pack with all features. TikTok is one of the application that I love the most so far and enjoying every day with new generation smartness that package of all in one with upgrading every day.

. Tiktok was a great app. Good for me and i became addicted but i was on tiktok and it said on the screen Account status your account was logged out. Try logging in again and i was like okay and i went on my profile and pressed the top bar thing where you obviously have your other accounts and i have 3 and the other two wasnt there. So i thought what and i tried to log in but it kept saying things like Server error i thought it was my WiFi playing up so i turned on my mobile data and it still wouldnt work so i powered of my phone and powered it back on i even tried to re-download the app and it still didnt work. Tiktok help me out im getting annoyed and upset because i was doing well and i even managed 142 viewers on one of my videos and i work hard on them
"Use less data. Even tho I have 5G on and data is restarted like new TikTok acts like it needs more something to load. I hardly go on because of it. Scroll down through vids and maybe 40vids in it gets slow and cant load the images, cant heart it, can even go to the person profile to see part 2. Have to close up the app and remove it on my time line and reopen it again and play from the top. Frustrating what it is"
"My Favourite Way to Have my Data Harvested. Unlike Facebook, Im pretty sure Tik Tok has never been used to orchestrate a genocide in Myanmar with 0 pushback from the companys CEO"
"Review on tiktok. hi Ive never wrote a review about tiktok before but I thought Id give kids a heads up on this app before downloading,lets start with the good things,this app is a fun app too dance too music,make up your own dances,learn dances,lip sync too your favourite music,duet your favourite tiktoker or anyone,its a nice app,just too have fun on,you dont have too create an account,but you can scroll on your fyp also known as your for you page where you watch people from all over the world do  there thing now moving onto bad things,this is a toxic app,it can contain,trolls,bullies,racist people,homphobic people,hackers,etc,and Theres been lots of bad things gone on with this app over the past few years such as:peopl tracking your location,people watching your every move,people hacking your account and getting all ur info,tiktok trends that end badly,but I just think this app needs too be more controlled,theres older men and women on that app that I dont think should be on there,because its a kids app,who knows what wierdos can comment on your video,etcbut Im writing this review too give you a heads up thank you"
They stole my data But I had an antivirus. An antivirus is not enough. You need protogent
Horrible. TikTok tracks you and it is sexism racist horrible do not let your child download this app it also is very addictive and it ruins your life because your always on your phone its a genuinely horrible app theres also tons of creeps looking at your videos and your body please dont download
Fun app but. I like the filters and stuff but when I go to post something theres a green dotare yall spying on me without my permission?CAUGHT IN 4K
Markied. Im enjoying this App so Much if you guys can make it happen you can get me to 277thousand more followers on my incredible TikTok lets gooooo and make it happen & no rush 
Love it but one thing I dont like. This app is amazing but a feature I would love for them to have is that you can control you fyp (for you page) because I hate scrolling through and having videos I dont even like. Also the privacy restrictions really get on my nerves
"READ This is important DO NOT GET THIS APP. the app tiktok doesn&#39;t want you to know a lot of things. tiktok has been under fire recently for a new offence; spying on its users. the anonymous hacktivist group has called it &#39;Chinese spyware&#39;. The united states government has declared it a national security threat, and the government of india has gone as far as banning the app altogether. the app poses many threats to its users by collecting data. --&gt; do I think tiktok is dangerous? I think it does have the potential to be dangerous, I have deleted tiktok and it broke my heart but in my opinion it is worth it. Instead I recommend getting this app called &#39;byte&#39; it was supposed to be a replacement of Vine, however musical.ly (tiktok) took over. It is very much like vine. It does take some getting used to but I think it is much better than tiktok &lt;3"
Interesting and engaging. Its good. Im not sure how much data they use tho. But its entertaining for sure. The app does tend to favor wealthy white creators which is annoying. And has pretty obscure moderation enforcement while it doesnt moderate a lot of hateful comments
Tictoc is fake. I used this app since September 2019 and it stole all my data from my expensive iPhone 11 pro which I bought from £1350DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APPI think I will just say ratings = -100 out of 5
"TIKTOK IS AMAZING. OMG first of all tiktok is amazing like with Facebook where your one post goes viral instead with tiktok you can go viral as a person I have so so so much fun on tiktok its incredible. Tiktok gives you options to change your voice and the way you look with cool effects and even better you dont have to have a million videos to get a lot of followers you gust need a good video that people like and youll blow up. Make sure to download this app, if youre still not convinced then here is something else to like about it, tiktok has trends and these trends can be really fun and you can get literally millions of likes for making a video you enjoy. Tiktok also has duets so you can duet on another persons video if they allow you to, tiktok also has sounds to videos, say for instance somebody is doing a trending vid you can click on the disc in the bottom right corner and you can mime to that sound and get more likes, as you can see you can become famous on tiktok if you upload good vids. Tiktok is not only about uploading good vids and having fun but there is also heaps of great comedy and funny things to watch. Last of all there is no dislike button on the video so there is technically not as much cyber bullying as any other apps. Overall I think tiktok is literally my life I love it. Oh by the way my tiktok name is Mickey_p"
They literally hack you lmao. Check the terms and conditions they genuinely give your apple id info away it happened to me and a ton of others look it up
"Lashas Take Tarot therapy card consulting. If you would like to learn how to read tarot cards one of the umbrella services on my website is the TAROT-CARD resource centreMission:- to uphold peoples emotional health with respect, integrity and radical truth along with providing you information about your life .Ive also created different workshops and books to help people with their critical thinking and decision making. TTCC is a nonprofit organization and sole proprietor business.Half of every reading donation is forwarded toward people who have been injured mistakenly by somebody in the healthcare profession or for seniors that cant afford , meals on wheels , home care and the like so for every contribution that people make Im keeping track of everybodys name as far as what you want to be called  Im not tracking how much everybody donates , however; the donations i track per quarter. Im going to write down the names of the people if they so choose who receive the help and videotape the reaction to then post on the website with every parties permission The administrative work for this particular sole proprietor nonprofit is exponential however; this will never take my distraction away from the person who is trusting me and I am trusting them as well and it can be a very fulfilling experience and I will not let any negativity or adversity affect my goals with TTCC as its in its infancy and thats so much more important to ensure that people receive the proper service and with the right intent and the corrupt services everything else falls into place you just have to believe in what youre doing and I believe   Im good to go Im just working on my website. I truly suggest people that seek psychics clairvoyance or empaths in which you donate for a reading donations for a quick 5 card read $five dollars , if youd like a 10 minute reading on zoom or I post the videos on TickTock for you its $10And then a flat rate of $25 for a 30 minute read and $40 for an hour read and I dont charge if I go 15 minutes over. As I have not set up PayPal as of yet Im even trying to figure out if I want it or not and I think I will get it however you also have the option to pay through email transfer and its a business account so the money automatically goes into a savings account for the charity and if you would like a receipt so you can write that money off you can because its a nonprofit organization and this is what Im doing to raise money . Remember the Lance Armstrong days and he had that charity called live strong and it turned out to be a fraud because 80 million people were wearing those bracelets in order to earn money for the charity . So Lance Armstrong sold bracelets and I am offering a personalize service and I will be selling beautiful necklaces to carry crystals and oils and as I stated below my mother makes them and Im going to post some pictures of them . I dont think that that was a cover for him to cheat I think the situation got ahead of him and he didnt want to disappoint the charity.Thats the other situation about charities when you donate to the heart and stroke foundation where does your $10 really go half the money from what Ive researched our payroll checks for people to run the charity thats absurd if people truly want to help othersSomebody needs to run the organization and that will be me when it starts to grow and it is in its infancy right now but those really popular nonprofit organizations I really wonder where does the money go and so with this not only am I going to provide receipts for people, Im going to videotape the experience and track everything and why give to my cause? right well if you love tarot and you want to learn how to read cards and youre interested in consulting .Im not just going to celebrate slip because of fame Im putting my heart and soul into your heart and soul and vice versa with these readings and the necklaces I dont know how much my mothers going to charge from for them but theyre absolutely beautiful so Im offering an intangible service and tangible services. I am using myself to raise money donations might as will be honest about it and some people sell bracelets I want to help people find their dreams and be happy.my mother makes beautiful bead necklaces to carry crystals and oilss and Ill be selling those and Ill give you an example of what my mother makes. This business is my mother and myself and the wonderful people that have come forward to me and I want to think Rayna, Rajinder and Jesse."
DO NOT GET. STEALS UR INFORMATION AND GB
Hacking. I was hacked because of tik tok I lost all my data
"My opinion about TikTok. This app is amazing but I recommend it for 10 and over due to inappropriate things.This app is addictive and all my siblings have it as well. You can create an account using your email or phone number. You can post videos them on your account and use really cool sounds and fun filters. You can only heart your own video once as well as other people. If  you have 1 million followers you can live stream and you will get a blue tick. There are magic tricks, pranks, singing, beatboxing, trying weird food, life hacks and many more. ( Heres a little tip: if your videos are too short you can go at the bottom and press 60 seconds.

Good but worried about data. Just worried about my data
I love This app but. Someone was asking me personal questions saying how old are you are you taken
Congratulations to all involved.

Owners. The owners are using the app to save your files and listen to your conversations and watch what you are doing therefore you should turn off the camera and microphone
dont get this app. it spies on you but other wiseREDDIT IS BETTER
Fuming. Dont get me wrong to TikTok is an amazing app I love it spend most of my time on it but TikTok keeps logging me out of my account randomly now I have explained I cant change my phone number as my phone got stolen so I can not use it I cant remember my password and never set an email up so I can not get logged back unless I use my phone number which goes to the stolen phone which I have no clue where it is past time yous logged me back in without me having to do anything but if h log me back in again could you change the settings so I could change my phone number please so things like this dont happen in the future
"Why dose this exist. This app is malware. Not only did I find a suspicious amount of battery and data usage, but this app promotes soft to hard core child pornography. I did have this app once and it is mindless and consumes your day. Dont get this app if you read this, be the bigger person"
"This app is very dangerous. It spies on you. Unfortunately, this app is a very dangerous app. This app was created by a Chinese company. Once I had downloaded TikTok. I went onto safari and searched up a few things about mathematic for my maths project. After searching up a few things about mathematic I felt like watching a few TikToks. Once I where on the app I saw lots of mathematicians teaching maths and so much more about maths. This app can basically see your Google search history and spies on you. I really creeped out after seeing all of this. Please do make sure that you are safe. This company is just very vicious and sketchy"
One of the worst. One the worst apps for privacy issues.  Take a look at the amount of data that TicTac gathers on its users  And I thought that Facebook and Instagram were bad
My Personal TikTok Rating. 5 Stars You know why? This is the most entertaining App out right now in my opinion
"Its very entertaining. I can post any kind of videos that I want The videos that people post are so funny and people post great hacks and crafts and more But there are some sketchy people so just make sure you dont send out any personal information. Its probably best if you dont put in your Instagram, YouTube etc. TikTok saves your information and if you are under 13, just put your age as 13 or higher so you dont get banned"
"THIS APP SCARED MY BEST FRIEND. SOMEONE ON THIS STUPID APP MADE A FALSE VIDEO ABOUT SOME RANDOM PHONE NUMBER TRACKING DOWN PEOPLE AND MY FRIEND GOT A TEXT FROM THAT NUMBER AND GOT SUPER SCARED, SHE WAS WORRIED SICK. I COULDNT HELP BUT GET SCARED TO. ITS NOT OK HOW YOU ALLOW THIS. I DEMAND YOU TAKE THIS APP DOWN/hj"
they sell ur data. iv been hacking tik tok and see that they hack ur data and sell it they pay vpns for codes to breach and check ur data
"Racism, homophobia and ableism. There have been too many creators shadowbanned for these three reasons to protect them from harassment. If they wanted to be protected, they would be a private account. This app needs to sort out its priorities and stop all of this rubbish"
Tik Tok Review . I love Tik Tok so much one of my favourite apps all my family have now got it and I am slowing getting big on likes and followers the only bad thing is is how much data and storage it takes up on my phone. Thank you for the person who invented Tik Tok
"CCP (Cancerous, Cringe, Painful). Foreign spyware feeding all your personal information and habits straight to the Chinese Communist Party.Also the words used above and many more explain the type of content and the narcissistic people you will find on this app.(Side note: Ive never personally downloaded it but Ive seen my sister using it on my Apple ID)"
Great fun. I still love everything about it But it should improve the Privacy options.
Trying to sell me everything. I will probably stop using this app because lately Ive noticed that every other clip is trying to sell me some object or sell me some lifestyle and/or talking about something I mentioned earlier that day in a private conversation with someone. They are really starting to mess this thing up. I just wanted to get a laugh here and there. We had a good thing going
"Asap Data Recovery. Nice app, no wonder so popular"
Ehmmm. Its a really cool app I just saw so ting about chinas government watching all us on the app and stealing our personal info but idk probably not true I think tosh is a very fun and cool app but that vid freaked me out
Tiktok. I love this app because its a fun way to take up time and to find new things to do .Theres lots of funny videos to watch and you can watch your friends videos too . If you dont want everyone to see your videos you can have a private account where only your followers can see your content or a pubic account where everyone can see your vids
Awful. My account has been deleted due to complaints of bullying through people hacking my account and I was really needing the account back due to it having photos on there of my mum who I recently lost to cancer and I no longer have those pictures
"Tik Tok review by Maisie Howarth - @maisie..Howarth. This so is great x you can create your own profile and follow all of your friends xx you can like videos or even earn your own likes and followers  The privacy settings are awesome too x of you dont want certain people following you , you can just turn your account into a private one and you have the choice for who follows you. Also you can turn of comments and choose who can see your videos - this was wrote by @maisie..Howarth on tik Tok"
Love Tik Tok. I dont believe any that propaganda about other countries spying on us through the app lol 
"Ok dont get me wrong amazing but. Well, tik tok the place where you can get tracked and terrorised and even more thots, cruelty, selling drugs, but its an amazing app and tik tok i hope you dont get banned its just can you make like a big privacy thing how like it has a anti tracker and stuff just so people wont get kidnapped and stuff its great for chatting and stuff one of my friends left school and we chat there nearly every day so yeah thats my honest opinion"
"Tiktok is problematic. Tiktok is a platform that many incredible people are a part of. And many of these wonderful creators are building meaningful communities and connections and using this app as a means to educate people on relevant social issues and spread awareness and positivity. However, Tiktok is continuously shadow-banning and censoring creators for posting BLM, feminist, body positive and lgbtq+ content for violating community guidelines. But they are not disciplining racist, sexist or transphobic comments and posts or comments and posts that glorify body shaming, eating disorders, or the objectification and sexualisation of women and girls. Tiktok blocked all queer related tags, using the argument that they wanted to protect queer creators from homophobia and transphobia. News flash: silencing and already oppressed group, during #pride month no less, and refusing to let them share their thoughts, feelings and experiences IS discrimination. Perhaps try removing the hate comments and posts instead of censoring the people theyre targeting.This is unacceptable. This affects big creators and small ones.We are sick of this.Do better, Tiktok.Stop being part of the problem"
. This is fun to watch and spend my time on when I have nothing else to do it inspires me sometimes. The only I would have it look into is banning for no reason and more privacy options such as followers hide and more warnings such as loud sound and scary warnings because sometimes Ill randomly a scary video I cant watch and loud noise when I need to be quiet. Thank you for a good app 
Tiktok privacy. I want to talk to my friends and fans but there setting 16 and under cant message and im 14-15 they should make an setting of messaging allow messages
"to everyone whos reading reviews WARNINGS . For people who think tiktok is fun/good well u guys are wrong And dont think Im lying but if u play tiktok than U NEED TO BE CAREFUL   because u guys dont know what behind tiktok and that I mean when your doing dances on tiktok well theres other people who are spying on you guys if u have tiktok Dont believe me well I can show u or tell u prof PROF THAT  TIKTOK IS BADTiktok is bad because people are spying on you And if u dont believe me than why did Donald trump BAND tiktok in u.s and other white countries/Im telling the truth If u STILL DON:T BELIVE ME GO LOOK IT UP YOURSELF People who dont believe these things. And even I think Donald trump even said it but u can look it up yourself and to the developers It is your fault and  this will happen if u dont be carefulPEOPLE WHO NEVER LISTEN If u dont be really careful than youll end up as in those other people on the news gone missing,kill,rape,etc that will happen to u one day AND I MEAN IT IF U DONT BE CAREFUL PEOPLESorry to tiktok developers who think I espoused them but it TRUE AND THAT WHY U DONT GET APPS LIKE THIS NOT EVEN  SNAPCHAT OR INSTAGRAM,TWITTER,TWICH ETC.  RIP TIKTOK LOL AND RIP TO PEOPLE WHO NEVER GOING TO BELIVE ME Tiktok u guys are so bad like nice try to spying on people but your never going to get what u want"
"Tik tok is bad. Tik tok can track you and can hear you even if your iPad ,phone , mobile and saves your data"
"Incredible. Downloading this app was one of the best things I have ever done It is really good for making me laugh and also so relatable Even though people say it isnt very safe, I completely disagree, I have had no problems the 4 years on having it with a private account. 1000/10"
"blehhh. THIS APP is so TOXIC. IT PROMOTES: - RAPE - PEDOPHILIA - CYBER BULLYING/HARASSMENT - RACISM - PERSONAL INFORMATION NOT SECURE seriously, for me the app is actually sort of enjoyable. ive come across many content creators that have taught me some cool things, but i REFUSE to support an app that doesnt do anything about the absurdity that goes on on the platform. its pathetic. if you enjoy the app i get it, it can be hard to get rid of because its so addictive, but i recommend deleting the app. life gets much better without it ngl, and on top of that you STOP SUPPORTING AN APP + GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OK WITH SEXUAL AND MENTAL HARASSMENT ON POC/ DISABLED FOLKS/ + MINORS"
Private/wifi. I love it but the fact that private are in the same place as the public is pretty confusing wouldve been better if it was separated just like musically and add that when its private u can still do some modifications and also would be rlly cool if we had access to the songs we save when we dont have wifi so will be able to make tiktok with no wifi but over all its super fun
"Bro, this app is stupid. Hey kids, lick toilet seats and puss yourself, do it, all the cool kids are doing it. Dont mind us while we collect your data despite it being illegal do collect the data of minors"
Right so. Its a fun app just stop stealing my data xoxo
I like this app but. I like this app a lot but my account has been bannned for no reason I have done nothing thats not allowed and every time I get TikTok I get weird messages when I am not logged into an account. Therefore I think I have been HACKED I know that the creators have been trying to delete hacking accounts and deleting videos that have vialated the guidelines but please try harder I was really sad when this happend and it keeps happening and as much as I love this app just please try harder thank you  this app has gone from musically to TikTok and its done really well thank you so much 
Amazing for small businesses. TikTok is unmatched in its potential to connect small businesses with its customers It has been an incredible tool for my business and Ill be happy to continue using it and tell everyone I know too
"CPC (Chinese communist party) is censoring and manipulating the app. CPC WORLD CONQUEST , do not use this app as XI-JINPING will steal your data and use it to do god knows what exactly"
TikTok. I love you but you too they chop data 
Re: Personal app rates. I gave a honest review rate of how much I have learnt from Tik Tok to venture out and cover my journey soon to share with like minded people the joys and wonders of life. Thank you
"Chinese hack spyware. If Karen was an app this would be it, the Chinese steal all of your personal information and blackmail you.help me get this app Dow to 1.0 star rating to help people"
Idk where they buy their data from. Search prefill suggestion of 17 weeks pregnant. Ive not interacted with any pregnancy related tiktoks and Im a male. Only spoken to my girlfriend about it on WhatsApp. Scary to know the amount of data bytedance has on us
"ADDICTED. I tried to say no to this one like so many adults, however, this apps potential is limitless. The new update, to make child safety a priority, definitely put this app on the right track.p.s.If youre not on TikTok and you own a business, youre behind the curve.M"

"Help. Im facing a problem in this app,my account is private and I upload my vids with the privacy (friends) but there are some views on my vids how is it happening?????Why is it happening????"
Is it true. On BBC news it said tiktok steals information from your deviceI have Roblox and when I had tiktok I went into a game and it said same acc launched from different device so is it TRUE
Great app. You can definitely lose track of time on his app/entertainment and can be informative but always do you do due diligence

"Dumb. This app is terrible and innapropriate It sells your info, and bad reviews are deleted. My last review was also deleted"
Love love love. Great platform.. but should be owned by trustees - ones not using the data for evil per se
Spyware. They spy on you Do not get this app
Chinese overlords. This is good download youre data safe and we wont stalk you
I love TikTok . TikTok is an amazing social media platform. Ive had it for a couple year and its one of my favourite apps. It has a load of incredible videos and u can chose what you want to see I dont know what to say about it other than I love it. It has adds but you can pass easily so its fine. You can have a private account and only let your friends watch or a public account and let everyone one watch your videos and its age rate I would say is 10+ but thats my opinion. I love TikTok would definitely recommend getting
Lol datamine. This app is definitely stealing your data lol 
Privacy settings are way too strict. i accidentally changed my DOB to something younger than 16 and now no one except friends can comment on my videos. I want to change my DOB please so that my account can go back to normal. Please remove the stricter settings. This new setting should apply for under 14s instead. I used to love this app too and now i find it annoying
"AMAZING. Tik tok is such a great app, there are no glitches and if there is an update then Tik tok will let you know what it is about. It has loads of great affects and it keeps me entertained for hours I really do recommend this app. Parents, if you are concerned about letting your child have this app, then take a look at the privacy settings. If you make your account private then only you and your followers can view your videos. You can also accept and decline peoples requests to follow you by going to inbox and pressing on follow requests. I hope this helps"
"Til Tok Review (Amazing). Although many people are scriptural about the Chinese stealing info, this is an amazing app to spend time on. It really makes time fly with its amazing short videos and quick access to all the videos. You can easily search a video or user which makes it easy to use. Or just use the for you page (FYP). I really love this app. I hope you do too"
From China communist party. This software looks like a spy and try to get access your bank details and spy your mobile phone dont buy it . Dont install
"Its great. This app would be highly recommended in my books for it is fun to use and you can also learn, find super cute small businesses to shop from and fingers crossed get famous. But never fear if you doing want your account to be seen their is a privacy setting (this means you Jay only people who you allow to follow you can see your vids) It doesnt even affect who you can follow. "
Im addicted . I love it so much. I have had it for over a year and Im getting more and more attached. I love how you can have more than one account. I just really wish they could do this thing to make TikTok work without WiFi or mobile data. That would be absolutely amazing . Overly its amazing and I recommend it 100%
DO NOT GET TIKTOK. Why? You wanna know why its such a bad app? Well the CHINESE USE TIKTOK AS SPY EQUIPMENT TO SPY ON YOU and it is very dangerous and it is full of horrible people online too 
An app for irresponsible people without a real life. An spy app from China that censor content and encourage to spread irresponsible stupid acts
Dont get it. I hated tik Tok because my best friend started being with others and left me behind and then after my friends said that tik Tok takes my personal info and that tik Tok admitted it. Yea something really bad just when you start getting obsessed what a bad app so now Ive almost LOST my BEST FRIEND because of this app
Great app. This is such a good app. It allows for anybody to share content with anyone you can have a private account meaning only people who you slow to follow to you can see your videos which range from around 15 second to 1 minute or less. You can have a public account where anyone can see your videos. You can see big creators and celebrities on this app. However it can be slightly addictive as you loose track of time very easily. There is still hate on this app as with every form of social media but it remains a predominantly positive app. 10/10 would recomend
It would be good but. This app would be good if the Chinese government wasnt spying on you They track your location ever 30 seconds I used to love this app before I found that out. Now I hate it
Bad. This app has Chinese spying so do not get this app and why do you people get this app?
"Personal tiktok experience. Ive been a tiktok user for a while now and Ive been loving it, the humour, the memes, and overall everything on the app, however recently its been acting really weird and I dont understand. First of all its constantly asking my age every time I log on, pretty annoying. Its also said everyone had 0 followers? And second of all, apparently theres an age limit on sending tiktoks, which I dont understand because I used to send loads of videos to my little sister, but now I cant and its very inconvenient. Relating on to the previous point I made on the constant age asking, my account is now being deactivated and then permanently banned since I missclicked on the wrong date. My account is ..a1isha if anyones reading thing. Tiktok fix this please"
Creepy. I heard you guys steal our info thats bad
". i have 4 accounts. shadowbanned on all of them for no reason, gee thanks a lot tiktok you spies"
Logs out of account. Tik tok has been giving me problems where it logs me out and I try to log back in and it tells me that I didnt download my data when I did. Its happened twice already and I have given up on trying to use the app
Videos on the app. Some videos are not for children so I think it can be a good app at times but I saw a resent video saying tik tok is a spying agency where when you let them have access to your camera they can spy whilst using and not using the app is this true or fake news
Fun. 10/10 recommend - has good privacy settings
"Great app. I use this app loads and I can say its really cool. There  isnt a premium were you have to pay for filters or special affects, which makes it easier to use. In your settings you can switch your privacy so no one can see your videos, only friends can or everyone can.There are loads of filters that update and change nearly every month, there are slide shows you can make with pictures from your phone, theres slo-mo video effects, stickers you can pin to your videos, text to add and more. I have had this app for about 2 years and I have never had any issues. However when I wanted to delete a large amount of video&#39;s I had to go threw them individually which took a lot of time. thank you for reading. "
"Chinese Spy app. This app use SIM card for location without your permission, this app use http server so its easily to hack your data. Better stop using this app. This is serious threat to everyone, its Spy app of China"
"Support terrorist. It collects data and support the terrorist of Israel. This guy had the audacity to take apple to court because he cannot collect no more date. Also he filtered so many pro Palestine campaign. He supposed to murderers and the tourist of Israel. Social media meant to be freedom of speech, we should be able to Voice our opinion"
Fun. Hours can fly by on this app. Entertaining. Has some cultural issues and whatnot but cool overall. Owned by a Chinese company that is rumoured to steal data but if you have nothing to hide (which you shouldnt lol) ur good
Stealing info. Oh Chilee you better delete this its china spy
"Convenient a lot things. This app has really grown on me. There are so many features you can use to make videos. You can be creative as you want. The app is constantly keep updating which is great I hope this will be an app that is here for longevity because many people can benefit from it. Its a good social media app you can use it for business, blogs, personal, etc"
Love this app but. Im having some issues with send info TikToks to others? My app used to let me send them in like a messages part of TikTok. But now I can only send it through my actual text messages deal or some other app. Whats wrong with my TikTok?
spyware. its pretty obvious that china is using this app to spy on people lol
"Ban it in Canada too . India banned this fcking app and had various proofs that this app is stealing data and selling it. If they can ban it, every independent country can ban it. Uninstall this app guys if you dont want your bank logins to get leaked. Youll regret if you keep this app"
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. . If you wanna download it then do it but you will regret it. Someone is watching you on there like a 40 year old man or something. Dont trust anyone in the community, Why you ask? They may steal your personal info. And this is my first review so yeah"
TikTok. Ok so this app is a very fun app but there are way to many spam accounts and so many rude ppl so I recommend age 12 and under have private accounts
"Horrible. This app is disgusting. Not only do the company behind this have access to your device and can share your info, there are a lot of toxic people and inappropriate people on here. Have seen old men dueting young girls. If I could give it 0 stars I would"
Bullying. My videos kept getting removed for community guideline violations even though i was doing no such thing. Judges verdicts on criminals and my own personal testimonies about my life are not violations. GOODBYE TIKTOK
Tik tok. Tik tok is so fin you can make short videos and learn all types with trends and dances you can also promote your business you can get likes follows and for those of you who like privacy just change your setting so over all this is An addicting app and is super give it a try
"HORRID HORRIFIC AND DISGUSTING. THIS APP IS THE WORST APPS E V E R FIRST OF ALL ITS INAPPROPRIATE SECONDLY ITS CRINGE (obviously) AND THIS APP HAS RUIN THIS     GENERATION ENTHUSE ON RUIN, ALSO THE LACK OF PRIVACY IS RIDICULOUS I HATE IT AND IT SOULD BE BANNED"
Tracking and data collection app. Tracks you and copies clipboard
"everyone is being hacked. as i said everyone is being hacked. not only that but ppl r getting their drafts posted w no @ and if you try to click on the pfp it says cant find account. i love this app sm this sucks. it also tracks ur location.. plz stop i love this app but i dont like how it hacks ppl, post ppls drafts, and more. plz stop"
Racism. Using this app directly condones and enables the Chinese concentration camps because the company are selling data to the Chinese government providing them with information that they can use to boost there economy
Very good app. This app is very good because you can watch videos and if you want to create a acc but you dont want it public you can put privacy settings on and on your vids you can put who you want to see it it could be friends followers or just yourself
"TikTok review. TikTok is an amazing app for all and it gives people a chance to do a lot of things they enjoy, it doesnt show any personal information, and several people get addicted. Ive never had a better app"
I love you TikTok. TikTok is a good tool to use and also personal
"Absolute amazing. My friends and I are obsessed when ever we have partys or do anything we always make TikToks. I love the TikTok house that have been created especially the sway house and the hype house being the original ones. I love how the app has something for everyone but I do wish people under the age of 12 didnt have the app as it does have an age limit but the content they make is really funny, eg, fairys or packages. However by the app being so big many of the TikTok house addresses have been leaked and then they get harassed they are so sweet people would like privacy so if you see this and get the address from somewhere do not go to the houses uninvited"
Tik tok spies on you. The app spies on you
This app is a app that can track your location. Sorry to say
hmhm. ok so i love the app and all but the main downfall is when i reported a 19 year old for stalking a 16 year old they said its perfectly fine to keep the video showing some of his personal information on the internet and she literally bullies him then fan girls over him 
"Absolutely fab. I like this app so much and I have been on it since 2018. The only thing is I have been asked for personal info before so I think tiktok should start requesting people to talk with strangers. Altogether, this app is amazing and I love it"
"hey. i love tiktok, and it has good content the only thing i believe you could add to make the app a better place is if you could select your videos to delete, favourite, or private"
"Not safe for childrens. As a parent I had to delete this app in my kids phone. I am also skeptic about security, privacy and data sharing with third parties and communist Country.Keep kids safe  Contents are so random and disgusting"
Just bad. A bad concept in general. Having talentless people lip sync over copyrighted songs would get taken down on any other platform but here is OK for some reason. Not to mention the privacy issues
"Good but kinda creepy. I love TikTok, its really entertaining and I use it everyday but recently these Japanese women have been liking my TikTok comments. I heard they can have your IP address and track your location and Im scared to leave the house. I really need TikTok to remove these Japanese women"
"I LOVE TIKTOK. This is such an amazing app, I love how lots of different people and cultures. I love the dances, comedians, people who make drawings, the artist and everything else. I also like how you can hide users if u dont want to see there content and how the privacy settings are. Overall this app is amazing "
Do you need an account to watch videos?. No you do not have too. Tiktok is one of my favorite things in my life Downloaded it now to see if you like it and if you do not dont worry you can always delete it  you can watch the most famous people in the world do inbarresing tiktoks my tiktoks are so cringe  please follow for follow my name is HollyfanXOXO40 thank you guys hoped this information helped I love helping people 
This app spys on u. Be carful with this app
"Morgan Exley. This is a stalking app the Chinese use it to stalk your email and personal info e.g address thats why India, Australia and United States are considering doing that I would never recommend your children to download this. Also do not support this app because of the amount of ads they put on YouTube its to much and do not deserve your download or support"
Tik Tok. You need to fix some thing this app is very dangerous because people can find out your personal information and the can post inappropriate things and the hole world can see it
Tik tok. I decide to get this app as a joke. But soon after l realised it was an amazing app. You can express yourself on the app and also it is highly secure with your privacy. So far(1 year) l have had no issues with tik tok. Please download amazing app
"Read. Dear Tiktok, please add a delete feature where so it removes all my favorited, and liked videos. It is probably the reason why my documents &amp; data on this app are overloaded"
Tiktok Is SPYWARE. Well When You Give It Camera And Microphone Access It SPYS ON YOU
I LOVE TikTok . So it has definitely been a good source of entertainment in these trying times.  I like that it personalized and also personal  I love a good prank or cute animal videos so thats what I get sent to me.  And if you leave a like or a post often that creator will answer you back . Also the Lives I like that you can actually ask that person a question and get an answer in real time
DUMB . Hi Im olivia If i could rate this 1 star i wouldI was 8 when I first got this app It was cool Until a random man started following meAnd said hi I was scared for I did Not know who this was.I brought my iPad to my mother and she deleted the appMy friend still had the app and said my account was stillThere I had to delete all the videos of of my iCloud and photos I do not like the fact that little kids can get roped in to theesType of things.Anyway lets stop talking about me let focus on the kids who Get this appI was watching the news with my family and hered about Kids showing there bodies and talking drugsAs a 9 Year old now I do not LIKE this as ALL People can compliment on your videos and ask personal Questions Sorry that it took so long Its gust so Much things to hate about ticktock Hope u All stay safe and delete this app immediatelyBye
The best app. Probably the best app out here for all different kinds of information and fun
Concerning. Ive had TikTok for a long time but the content when you scroll down allot of the time is just disgusting I dont mind dancing or anything thats takes hard work but theres a dark side and thats why I deleted this app and Im warning others about it when Im scrolling you could scroll to something inappropriate even for 18+ and they say go to this page and its horrible a Video saying do you see that girl that cut her arm I checked the comments and I thought it was a prank but no it was a girl that slices her arm and she probably died and there are all sought this is my personal opinion please you can download it but dont go down to the comment if its scetchy this is my personal opinion not a hate message thank you for reading
"Great. hey it would be good if you allow us to choose who can see our tiktoks like specific people or be able to send private tiktoks to someone via messages and please can we be able to send videos and photos to friends on messages, other than that tiktok is amazing"
"Racism. Please take immediate steps to reprimand TikTok for unfair mass disproportionate censorship of creators. TikTok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators they considered susceptible to bullying based on their physical or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data and fake information and will continue to mislead others. #19th"
"Its a good app, with a bad side. This app is VERY GOOD I dont know if its my data or wifi, but sometimes the app doesnt let me scroll and has the wifi connecting dots. There also are lots of haters, people saying storytime? and crop? is also very annoying. But thats not your fault, its our generation, the kids. Ive sadly been permanently banned seven times for absolutely NO REASON I went private on my account now to get less hate and less mass reports, but this isnt fair. I also had two videos of mine being taken down for minor safety. Im not even a minor?? I also lost over 120 followers randomly, I had 870, now I have like 740. Im really trying to go live, but I might just get banned again. Other than all of the bad things, this app is really fun It takes up so much time scrolling through. When I was a kid, I always dreamt of being a famous youtuber, my dream *KINDA* came true Im not famous, but 700 people is 700 people"
So do some thing to fix that. Bro I like this app but every time  I turn my iPad off it delests its data
"AMAZING. hello. I have TikTok and Im quite young and not quite 12 yet. But its amazing I have a public account, and gaining followers so fast. Im on 20k now You can block haters, and have fun watching TikToks are very fun. I could scroll through there for hours. Some are slightly inappropriate so Id recommend scrolling on them, as the more you watch them the more you will see those kind of videos. But there are loads of good content creators and lots of them are friendly, even to their youngest and oldest followers If you are quite young, Id recommend having a private account but if your parents have permission, Id make a public account but not sharing any personal stuff like me. If your older, you can go ahead and download TikTok You will enjoy it I promise "
Personal development. Tik tok really awesome apps for those people who are unable to get the platform its help to show their own talents
Storage steal. Great app but it takes up all my storage so I cant even download I more app 
PEDO STOLE MY KID(18+) GONE SEXUAL SYORYTIME. downloaded tiktok and not even 1 day of having it a pedophile tracked my house from the app and stole my kid dont download they will steal your kids
Spy your phone. Be careful
Age. I accidently changed my age and now it wont let me dm any of my friends and i downloaded the data and instantly took ne to files
I love it but. I love TikTok the only thing is that I feel like I would enjoy it more if you didnt meet data or internet to use the app and sometimes people get banned for somthjng they didnt do and people being told their under age when their not I feel like TikTok should take more priority in the app but besides that I love the app and I would be really happy if you fixed this sorry if it sounded rude didnt mean it in that way x
"Visiting our service too frequently. It isnt letting me log back in to my account. It just keeps saying You are visiting our service too frequently. I tried deleting and putting my phone number in again, but it said the same thing. Last night I tried putting my phone on cellular data again and it worked. Today I did that again but this time it didnt allow me back in. Please just let me back into my account @recyclingbins"
Amazing. Amazing app love it 10/10 apart from the stealing data thing
Hackers. Stole my data
Amazing app. This is a great app You can find any information that you need
"Hm. Amazing app One thing, ur tracking us and what we are doing, other then that amazing app"
Addictive steals info. Title explains itself just look it up
"Super fun and cool. Tiktok is one of the hottest social apps there is All my friends had downloaded TikTok on their devices, so I decided I should get it too At first I didnt get why the app was so popular, but after just a couple of minutes, I was addicted You can watch Funny videos, dramatic videos, Extreme videos and talent videos like singing and art Also, you can jump on the latest DANCE trends, which are super easy to learn I started making cool Art and singing videos on my public/main account  lilyana_art_and_music Its so fun to get feedback and likes, and watch your account grow If you dont want anyone unless people you know to see your account, you can switch to a private account for more safety and/or privacy Dont want mean feedback? Filter words or turn of comments Tiktok will give you a great experience Tiktok is the best app ever"
"Its fine. If you want to digest information really fast, this is the app my friend"
Wyatt0999. Really good app doesnt steal youre card info at all. It would never do that. Like never ever withdraw 500 dollars from your card
"Obnoxious and sneaky. The videos on here are usually annoying and unfunny. The community is also annoying. The challenges performed are dumb and potentially fatal. Lastly, the app takes your data. Do not use it. Reddit, lets 1-star this app Together, we can do it. It wont delete the app, but it may help others delete it and realize its quality. Lets go"
"BE CAREFULL. Tik tok saves all your drafts (videos not sent) into this Japanese company were they watch what youve been doing. So say you had a draft without a top on or something, THEY WOULD SEE IT And say that you were having a shower and looking at your phone THEY WOULD SEE YOU IN THE SHOWER They also listen to your voice, so say someone was talking about wanting a no pair of shoes, it would come up as an advert in different apps So BE CARE-FULL (P.S they take A LOT if your data But the rest is amazing)"
Tiktok. They are spying on u ozgjfJarbarbrabr dont download it
@slicktires01. It not letting people view my video it pick and chose who u can watch even tho my privacy settings is off
"Amazing but one thing. This app is amazing and you can see all different types of people. When you first get tiktok you have a variety of hobbies or options of what you would like to see from tiktok. When Im bored I log on to tiktok and it loads longer when Im using my mobile data. Every app that needs internet works perfectly fine with my data but tiktok only lets me see one video and then all the other videos dont load. I like how you can go to your profile and go to tour drafts, you can chose what tik tok sound you would like to use and do it without any internet. . If you have read up this far please give tiktok a five star as they deserve it and it has an amazing variety of videos to watch. Kind regards,Anonymous"
. Chinese spy wear takes every single bit of your data it can ( records mike location etc ) cant wait for it to get banned
Fun. I recommend you to download TikTok if u get bored a lot like me it is very entertaining and if u want privacy but want to make videos you can have that Just put your account on private like me Coming from a teen you should do it
Tik tok is the best app. It never lags and also it will never go through privacy settings
Dont download. Chinese government uses it it to spy
Keeps me laughing. The things people say and do are just to funny on this app. Its also a good source of information sharing
"Tiktok. Tiktok is a place where people of all ages can go and be themselves They keep it as safe as possible for everyone The only down fall is deciphering a real complaint or not I see people get put in tiktok jail, as they call it When the content is not breaking guild lines, it get blocked of personal opinion. But other than that I love tiktok It has brought my personality back it had made a way for me to express myself thru others that are going they the same Its just an all around great app"
"To much strorage. When i first downloaded this app I had many other apps such as:WhatsApp Instagram Snapchat and just some games .However,when I downloaded it my storage got extremely full,this could be beacuse I have only got 32MG(but not verry likely).Before the app my other apps were accessible, but when I downloaded it I had to delete all those apps except whatsapp(so i could still stay in touch with freinds abd family).I then had to delete all of my photos so all of my memories (wich I didnt have backed up)were gone.I could not access whatsapp at all and I had no photos or any apps to delete,in result I could not talk to my freinds or my family .I recently delted the app furthermore now I have over 19MG of data and the app has not downloaded at all and I cant not get any off my apps back as it has been loading all night and day.It can not be TikTok being down as my freind was on it last night (the night of).This could also be because i have a iphone7 but it is not likely I dont recommend downloading if you do not have much storage"
Cool. Super Fun to whatch just dont leak any personal info
Tik tok is Chinese controlled. Every single good review is meant to make think this is good.But dont download this app its toxic and ccp (Chinesse communist party) collects all your information of what you even outside the app.The thing is this app destroys your brain dont download
Bad. I used to love this app but now  I heard that tik tok just collects data from children so I deleted it
Pure communist cancer. Id rather get cancer than use tiktok and support data theft by an authoritarian communist government
"A Life Changer. What TikTok have done for the world is incredible. Firstly for the general public, being able to connect with random people all over the world and see glimpses into their lives is just phenomenal. Secondly for myself as a business owner clients from different countries have been able to see my work and Ive been able to change their lives thanks to the remarkable algorithm of TikTok, which I hope you guys keep like this forever "
"My personal opinion. I think it's a great app Their is a lot of negative reviews, but i personally love it. Their is a toxic/negative side of TikTok that you should try to stay away of. I love TikTok, and no one will change my mind"
Honestly done with this. I had posted multiple tic toks and none of them worked to further that my data got leaked out because of tic toks terrible security then I couldnt go on the app entirely if any parent is thinking of getting this app do NOT GET IT for your kids
Incredible and fun experience. This is the best app ever you can express yourself and show of your talent with the world and if u dont want anyone t see it u can set it on privacy I would definitely recommend this app
"TikTok. TikTok is an amazing app you can have many accounts and the good thing is, is that you can hardly get hacked unlike any other app. I really like it and you post videos of many entertainment things and you can get A LOT of views or you can get hardly any views. You can have followers and you can follow other people that you find supportive and bold for your opinion. I recommend this app for 7+ because there is children on the app that are like 5 but its a seven plus up for sure, I mean most of the content is meant for young people anyway because they knew they were gonna be on the app anyway. The thing is, is that if you are 7-10 you need an adult to make your accounts or account because of the date and make sure that you account is private so no creepy old mean or anyone you dont know can see your videos. All you have to do is sign up and its really easy Also as a new update could you please make it easier to delete videos Im trying to delete so many and I have so many more left. Im just trying to restart"
"I love it but. I loved tik tok and I still do but my mum said that China can track you and steal your information even if you are on a different app. Tik tok is propbabaly the best app that I have ever had until I found out about China. My sister, a few of her friends and me and one of my friends all completely deleted the app because we didnt want to be tracked or stalked. If China stops this I will beg my mum to get it back"
Great app. Only thing I wish was different is you could set privacy to public for certain videos
"Tik Tok Scares me. Tik toks algorithm has always scared me. Its a good app with similar approaches to many other video and content producing apps but, and this is a big but, its just not ethically right in my eyes. The app is like selling crack to kids. Kids and many adults are so unaware of the dependence they have on tik tok. They form a fear of missing out and being bullied if they do not remain in the loop of the newest tik tok dances or memes. Its algorithm intentionally is to spread content to as many people as it can. Either through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, snapchat etc. My question is what is next after tik tok? And what could tik tok be used for? Political or economic advances ? Data mining? Data theft?"
Scan. DONT GET THIS APP ITS CREATED FOR YHR CHINISE GOVMENT A BACK DOOR ITS A DATA FARM
Steals clipboard info. Steals clipboard info
"Complete Garbage, wont last long. Ive never hated a social media platform so much. Most of these videos are just designed to annoy the crap out of you by trying to be funny with the most over used audio tracks in the universe . I cant stand how many times Ive heard the exact same audio track used by person to person. If youd get rid of the audio tracks Id be absolutely happy to return. Im also seeing a trend where people are using these videos to make them selfs look either famous or stupid to rack up views rather than focus on staying connected with friends and family. I seriously doubt people will stay on this for long"
Its so dangerous. Don&#39;t install tik tok they hack into ur information
Fix your app. I like the app but I hate that you cant just delete it. You have to have access to your old phone number which I dont. Yall need to change that. Someone hacked my account and I cant delete it just because of a phone number. How lame
"Disgusting. Originally supposed to be for kids, but thats gone down the drain now that you regularly see pedophiles on your For You page acting disgusting towards 13-15 year olds. So I report a video of this man acting like a pedo towards this very young girls and the report comes back to me saying that there was nothing wrong with the video, absolute garbage. If you want to be tracked and/or hacked then go ahead and download it. Tik Tok is just such a disgraceful app, the police even warn you about downloading it. Thats how dangerous that app is. Teachers, police and politicians have even discussed it and said it is an extremely dangerous app and should not be downloaded  by those under 17. Please,please dont install it. Just dont"
Good. still addictive but ive heard they steal ur data
Its good but. At first it was the best app ever all of my friends and I loved it until our accounts started getting banned and we didnt know why so we tried downloading our data to see if it would let us back in the app but it didnt do a thing so now we are not aloud in the app which unfair cause now we cant even use the app and it made us all hate the app and never want to use it.We dont recommend this app to anyone
Corrupt. Talk about BLM rallies? Sure. Talk about Hong Kong? Banned. Theyve been caught harvesting user data. Google it
"Tiktok is for the weak minded. What kind of app, promotes and sexualizes children with weak minds? What kind of app subconsciously make us feel bad about our selves? What kind of rife app ruins our thought process, by fluctuating  our emotions constantly? Well, this is the app; Tiktok Its a mind destructing app that ruins your sense of reality. What kind of human being shows their body on the internet just to be glorified or praised. People shouldnt look out for strangers attention rather there family members and few selected close ones. Why? Because the people you love best are ones that you know best, a stranger would just pretend to be your friend and then use you. Why am I saying this? Well its because I know that mostly girls are being dmd by bad people. They will say to you  Oh youre, so beautiful And when you fall for it, you will just end up being used rather than loved. It takes time to live and know someone, dont just fall in the pit. Also, some of you might be saying oh my account is private/ or Im going to make my account private. Still This app will still persuade and use you to make you a materialistic, society b@ll sucker. Its sad to see Teens being conditioned to attain a false reality of this perfect body or life. There is no such thing, as perfect. Society is just making you think that certain things make you happy and give you a good life.Just improve on your self mentally and physically; not to get attention but to be stable and calm. So please this app is a waste of your time Dont get trapped You are strong"
"toxic. Ok so I deleted the app a couple days  ago and feel sm better, this app has ruined my life rlly Im glad I got off of it.  No ones funny anymore you r trying way to hard, everyone only cares about if ur pretty.  What happened bruh?? Its only about race, thats what youll see. Trump and race, trump and race blah blah blah.  Why do people have to see this??  Like Im so disappointed in this app, over the years its just gotten more disgusting and toxic.  if ur different u get death threats if ur not the blonde cutie.  Even the straight and alt tiktok thung is so stupid.  This app is like a dating app w a bunch of horny boys doing nasty as* povs that little girls and boys r seeing.  And you guys already got exposed for spying on millions, I hate this app just take it down.  Not fun, or addictive anymore, jyst cringy.  Bring back musically u did such an awful job. Sorry not sorry, you tried making it the best but actually made it worse.  Plz delete it at this point its one of the worst apps Ive seen in my life..like I hate to say this but Facebook is better than this cancer "
TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL 
Chinese spying app. This is a propaganda machine for china dont touch it
Chinese spys. Theyre stealing your data were not safe
"eh. Its an ok app. The icon will indicate I have notifications in the app but there never seems to be any follow up. I also dont like the auto play video with audio format. I find it irritating and it ultimately makes me want to open up the app less often. Theres also nothing original about this app. Its just Vine 2 and even then, its just another place to make posts and seek likes while gathering &amp; selling ur personal information in one way or another"
CCP data takers. Are you enjoying taking all the kids information
Amazing. Ive had tik tok since 2017 (musically) its overall very good but recently there has been Japanese women pfp stalking accounts and liking all their comments and if u go on 1 od their accounts u find a link dont click it it tracks ur IP ADDRESS and takes personal information.Tik tok has put a warning on this link so I think its a very good app.But please ban theses people tik tok
Yo. Love TikTok so much fun all the horror and crime stuff is fun to hear its a blast but I would like to out my face on my account but I dont want to access my personal gallery
Chinese Communist Propaganda. They are watching you and collecting your data
Dont download this app. If you download this app ur getting watched by the tik tok company and its an addictive app
"Something for everyone. There is so much information on TikTok, I believe there is something for everyone. You want a new hobby, investment help, cleaning hacks, dancing and so much more. Everything at you finger tips"
Bro why you steal data. Bruh thats not very cash money of you
". TikTok is light the best thing that happend to me. I can see my friends, and laugh, and really see the world how it should be. TikTok teaches you things, and digs out a passion for everyone. When I got this incredible app, I saw photography, amazing adventures, funny clips, and SO much more and I ADORE it. It gives you opportunities. The only downside is that you have to put in a phone number to text, and it is addictive....but goodness me I love itDownloading this app is a definite YES. Try it, its worth it. Thank you TikTok Ilysm "
AMAZING The best. I love this app Its really fun to make tik toks and there are privacy settings as well. Its for all ages and I recommend this app to anyone in the whole world 
Spyware of Chinese government. Cant delete this one China READ THE PRIVACY POLICY. Trump knows this but doesnt wanna start a war with China
"Algorithm is scary. My wife and I was having a conversation about ranch dressing and pizza. I pick up the app and the next video is from Domodraper featuring pizza and ranch.   That was scary. So I dont know if the app was running at the time but I definitely went to privacy settings and turned off the mic access for TikTok.I noticed that the Editors Choice review refers to teens using the app. I find that interesting. Coincidentally, Domodraper was sanctioned for community guidelines for duetting a video that visibly bared her chest while breastfeeding in the app but when I reported the original video for violating community guidelines, TikTok said she did not violate guidelines.  It makes no sense. Just be clear on what is allowed on the app so parents can be best informed on what their children may be exposed to"
Pls dont spy. Pls dont spy and take our information cuz then it will be banned across the world and everyone will want to kill yall CEOs of tik tok
"This got out of hand. Banning Tik Tok in the U.S. was a great idea that should be done everywhere. This is the sketchiest app ever. it steals your info, it has almost no good content, and its full of racists, pedos, and filthy crap"
annoying to use for minors. i am under the age of 16 so they recently changed privacy settings for 13-16 year olds which is inconvenient with the fact a majority of tiktok users are minors  uhh yuh
China?. Tik tok send ur information to Beijing aka giving away ur data
Waste of time. Im pretty sure this App is for Lower Functioning people or the Immature. There is nothing intelligent about any of the videos. Why do most videos start with the word When? How come no one can spell or write a proper sentence? I think this App replaces the Jerry Springer Show as well.  Why do people post themselves crying or post videos of someones last moments of life. What happened to Privacy? I thought Facebook was bad but TikTok beats it by a long shot
Chinese Government data stealer. Dont be brainwashed
Put back the favorite data. Can tiktok put back the part where we can see when people are saving our videos please?
"Review of TikTok. I think this app is great, actually think its incredible I get home from work and its the first thing I do when I sit down to relax and check up on my phone. I guess you can call it my addiction "
Delete tik tok. What ever you do dont get it. The Chinese government is spying. It is so bad and gae
Digital Crack. Tik toks ability to steal your data is quite frankly on a whole nother level compared to Instagram or Facebook. You could be thinking about toast and itll appear on your FYP. You could be pregnant and not even know it and tik tok will show you videos about being pregnant. Tik tok has the ability to read your mind almost. I wouldnt doubt that they use your camera to see how your face reacts to videos. Everything is recorded and then used to for tik toks super algorithm. Humans werent designed to have this much dopamine so fast. Dont download if you have problems with addiction
Not not good app. Everyone has been trying to hack my account. I get notifications but all it says is people are hacking your account. This is not a good app. People that I dont even know are following me. They are asking me for pictures of things that are inappropriate. I would not recommend getting this app
"Tiktok. Tiktok, an app that lets you post what ever you want but is quite good because if they think its inappropriate they take the video down. Fan pages: Charli fanpages can ask very personal questions so if you dont feel comfortable with them you can just scroll. You can only go live if you have 1k and can have a private account"
Dear China. Idk what you want my data for but decent app
Messaging. In my personal opinion I think that Tik Tok is a great app but this would be a 5 star rating only they didnt remove the messages. As now I cant send videos to my friends which is what I would do most of the time
"Hacking problem . Warning to all users of tik tokPaedophilic people are using this app to find young children and hackers can find where u live, it doesnt matter if ur account is on private, they will find u...and tik tok hasnt done anything about it...DELETE THIS APP NOW"
Personal Reflection & Growth. I owe it all to TIKTOK for allowing to grow both personally and spiritually.  I encouraged to what happens next both on TIKTOK and in my own life
"TikTok rocks. TikTok is going to revolutionize the way we communicate by the end of 2025With global communication and direct marketing to a vast amount of people in your interest niche its going to be very interesting to see how the tables of wealth change Will do to this app and I hopeI get a little piece of that pie because I am about to launch a product that is going to revolutionize the industry and We are about to make it go Viral If you walk your dog and have to pick up its turds this new powered pooper scooper is going to make you want to go for walks just to use it, show it off , word of mouth goes a long way . We here at cottonbelle farms needed a easier way to cleanup behind our horses on the trail and this is going to take the world by storm. Are yall ready to  see this amazing product us to we need someone to help us make a prototype. Lol yes I give tik tok and the laughs I enjoy watching everyone and creating content for my personal and business toks"
"Go app but hate the new update. Over all I really like this app but I hate the new update will all the privacy standards updated, and I accidentally put the wrong birthday in and now I can barely do anything and it doesnt let me change it"
Great. This app is wonderful if your kid is too young for TickTock its OKJust put a year they were born And they have a private TickTock and they cannot watch inappropriate ones and They cant google if you want priavite you go to your privacy settings and put it on private. if you wanna public wants to go to privacy. Hope this is helpful
Tiktok. This app is heavily addictive but you will find amazing content and incredible people
"Chinese spy machine. This is a Chinese product , perfect to spy on your private affairs"
"Tiktok wont let me go live. I love this app and it is so good for showing people fun and creative things that youve made. You can have a chance to show people what you love to do. It only has one downside and that is that if your under 1000 followers you cannot go live and connect with your followers in real time. Some people just arent good enough like me who can only get a couple hundred followers and then it just stops. If the TikTok developers are reading this make it so that anyone can go live and connect with their followers in real time instead of basically being famous just to go live. Dont get me wrong this is an amazing app but the amount of times Ive wanted to go live is incredible and Im starting to stop using it. If I do ever here the news that any one can go live I will never close the app, but for now we will have to wait or it might never happen and Tiktok will be forgotten about like vine without anyone under 1000 followers able to go live. Tiktok better do this before it actually is forgotten about and a new app will come along and do exactly the same as this will do"
"Unsafe. Tick-tock can track you and if your data is in the wrong hands you can be stalked,hacked and people can break into your house"
"For u TikTok. This app is incredible I used it 24/7 and I never get sick and tired of it. Hate now and then but who cares some people out there are just in a world of there own This app (TikTok) used to be musicly I loved it but its TikTok now and Im so happy it has changed, some updates dont work for me but Im not interested the app is already good enough Keep doing ur good work"
Hi TikTok. I love this app so much but TikTokplz get rid of the sex bots that are tracking peoples account its tracking my account and Im not even 13 yet or an appropriate age so please help the TikTok community
A problem. The app is very good but the thing is when I delete my acc and make another acc using my same email it asks me to reactive although I dont want to reactivate I want to make a new acc... so can you please fix that and one more thing... tik tok has changed my privacy setting as a private account would have although my acc is public... so please fix those two problems
This is amazing. Do not download if you wanted to get stuck you will get Addicted to this app for real though. Be careful not to watch this too much you will not stop like when youre at the dinner table you will want youre phone to watch TikTok but its really fun
"Very Good but can be improved. TikTok is a very good app to socialise with friends and family, it is also fun to create dances and inform people about the world. But unfortunately we have come across some pedifiles who try to get to young teens and asks for n#des and personal info. We also have come across cyber bullying on some peoples accounts, which is not ok. If these could be stopped, TikTok would be the perfect app for all years"
Beware people. Hackers everywhere through this app Be aware pplFrom the time I downloaded this from several south Asian places my email address is being hacked
TikTok. At first TikTok was really great but then they added some changes so that when you sign in you have to put an email and you get a code. But its really annoying because I hate giving out personal info about me So if your the same person like me you wouldnt really like TikTok
"chinese adware. chinese adware, download and get your data sold todayTM"
My Review. Plz take all the privacy stuff off I want people to duet and stitch my videos and I want to message people
Bad. The game reports you for no reason it also has many many bots on there looking at your private information it is a fun game but I would recommend just watching it on Safari so that youre not getting your information hacked or youre not getting reported or a shadow band
"Why?. Why is this app half run by the president and stealing private information from people? But why, you are just so desperate that you destroy the world bit by bit. Its just so sad, your leader aka the owner of China is worse then putin"
Horrible. I dont like this at all. It steals your info
"Warning people. Grant money from  Facebook and  instagram  is a scam please dont fall for it. Steal you information to get 13,000 dollars that you never get"
"Be honest. A lot of people say it glitches? But for me its completely fine Ive NEVER had a problem with tiktok and Ive had it for almost 3 years now, and yes I do know there are going to 18+ stuff that shouldnt be on there but yall have to understand that tiktok doesnt see everything so they cant take it down, plus its not only tiktok that has it EVERY social media platform has nasty stuff on there so yall cant only blame tiktok, next pointyes we all loved Musical.ly (And I did to lol) but tiktok isnt going to change back just because some people are asking lol-my final point: parents if your reading this YES it is fun-and there are privacy settings that can control who can message you, who sees you account, and who can follow you"
"My opinion and what Ive heard. Tiktok it self is amazing I love watching the tiktoks there but I mostly do get offended by some of the videos ppl have posted and apparently tiktok hacks? Thats what Ive heard, it can get your personal details and stuff if this is true, why??? I was enjoying it so much, and now I feel anxious"
I AM ADDICTED. I dont know how they do it but this app is amazing and that adds arent too invasive. Take my data baby xxx
Bhamber22. I dont like TikTok it take all my data up
My review :). Tiktok is an incredible app for expressing creativity. But there are some things I wish to bring to notice. Me and the whole editing community spend hours of work making edits for our followers and i think it isnt fair that our videos wont one on the fyp if we upload them from our camera roll. I Think tiktok is a different and unique app to others but these new features e.g adding storys are making this app turn into Instagram. I hope you consider an outsiders point of view thank you.Kind regards a user :)
My personal suggestion. Tiktok is a great app and stuff but like I think that everyone should have a chance on the for you page because lots of people arent getting that much attention that they should be getting. Overall I think that app is great its just that lots of people have died from trends which I dont like. I like the app very much overall and I think that the new update is great I would just like to be able to use tiktok offline since some people dont have wifi to watch sometimes
TikTok. Good entertainment and keeps me happy and it has a variety of videos to watch from sports to car reveiws it allways makes me feel happy but it wont let me go live or change my privacy settings
TikTok. Best app ever just stop spying on me its creepy
Praveen sharma review. Its the worst application I have ever seen. There are some many bad videos and peoples privacy is at extreme risk. I will suggest this app should be banned on all app stores
Bad. Its a way to sell all of your personal information to China and 190 mb is a lot of space I like It but it has some problems
Good app. Entertaining with lots of people documenting their personal life 
"so much fun. This app allows so much creativity for you mind. With endless filters being introduced, and endless sounds to chose from. You can really make anything you want to now. Its the first app of its kind that has done this well. The endless creators can inspire you and you can grow you account. The possibilities are limitless and theres so much to do. I recommend buying this app as it is free and easy to install. Just type your email in. Create a password and the fun starts. I have this app and I must say it doesnt require to much effort to blow up. (Go follow i.will.pause.for.u.2) However if you want some privacy its all there. You can make a private account. This mans only friend can see posts. You might get a follower. This means they still cant see you videos. you need to follow them back. Then you can see each others videos. So overall tik tok is a safe and fun app to use. I don&#39;t see anyone changing my mind about this any time soon. (also no need to worry about China. Tik Toks boss is american so no need to stress)"
"Individual Experiences. The algorithm for this app is incredible. I dont see much pf the trends or the top paid, but there is therapy, history, politics and for me. Its the only platform I really use"
"Tiktok is incredible. I think you should download this app because it is fun to use and easy to figure out , you can get famous easily on this app and I love it , a lot of creators earn money off of this app and you can be yourself"
tiktok. fix your app. wont even let me go on it after years of using this app. my phone is up to date and fairly new. very upset.UPDATE: i cant even access the account. it says system error every time i try to log in. and ik im not getting the password wrong cause i saved it
READ THE TRUTH ABOUT TIK TOK-. Best thing I have ever done I got it as a joke but now I love it Im actually obsesed Bad thing is tho I loose track of time and Im on it for ages lol this is the only app I use 100% recommended if ur like under the age limit I advise having a parent logged into the account so they can Monitor the account But its like the best app evr -Rosie (Sorry for any missed grammar and stuff Im dyslexic)
lots of storage. hi personally think tiktok is a great app and is my second most used app but it takes up quite a lot of storage due to the cache i believe? is there a way that i can reduce this or maybe in a future update have the option to clear all the data?
Bad app. Leaks your information to mainland China and also installs dodgy zip files
"Why. My friend and I live in the same place and she got tiktok I tried to get it but it says I am not eligible for tiktok I dont understand why I am 12 and even if I do the same birthdate as my friend it still says not eligible for it, but on the other hand it is still good I can watch on it but I dont like the fact that it can spy on you"
"Best entertainment app ever. The first time I downloaded this app was in 2017 I was bored  but just when I went and signed up for the app I made a video and it got viral in 6 mins and I was so happy at that moment then a month later I got 1,000 followers till this day I still grind my but off to get that money  for my parents and try to get a job it really hard but anyways it is an entertaining app it makes your day better and makes you forget about all of the bad things that happen idk what am saying at this point am just writing a review on this app so I can see if am in the review section lol so sorry guys but actually it its a good a you get money  easily like just in 5 mins or something like that it really easy you need to download this app its amazing  but yall can you guys do me a favour lol am rly sry but can u guys go on Addison rae profile and go type deego I dont know why I just want to see if this actually happens but yall right now its 5:43 oh now 5:44 in the U.K. damn time goes fast  not going to lie though but yo am hungry asf I need something to eat the reason am still typing  is to see how many words can I get to be in the in the review you if your still here your true legends actually just if you guys dont care  can you guys u know go to my TikTok profile and press that red button you know u might like the content u might not but yo .. OMG  am Actually scared  am not Joking right Now I see someone spying  on Me in my window so my window is opened now its closed but this drone is spying on me and I see a bee it hitting my window with a little green thing it holding I dont know what is it but I think the FBI is watching am not joking though damn am scared  asf yo guys am going to ply on my. Xbox am joining the whole in tire time"
. Rumours Your spying
Tiktok. I love this app its funny and it gives information that I need to know
Why I give bad reviews. 1 because you Worley me do what I want to you make me watch TikTok I dont want to watch and my account gets put private
"Reddit is better. Go join Reddit, it has better memes and doesnt send your data to the Chinese government"
Chinese spyware. All your data goes straight to the CCP
DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. Apple has seen tik tok spying 
Great. Its A Good App but I want to Make Tik Toks Offline and Post it kinda is annoying to use your Data just To post and Find an Audio 
Mi personal opinion. I think that TikTok its a pretty good app but the people its so cruel
Really good. Good privacy settings and I like the new update
"Hmm. Hi Tik Tok Good things about it:1. You can use any sound you ever would want.2. You can DM other TikTok users.3. Its so, so, so fun and entertaining (true fact: Ive watched TikTok at 3:49 am before).Some bad things about it:1. You can get hacked if you dont link your phone number or email address.2. DMs dont work sometimes.3. Youre most viral videos get taken down for no reason"
"Good, but. So I had TikTok for a while, and I got hooked. I was making videos and socialising with others as well. One of my friends (for privacy reasons, Im not saying her name.) asked if she could have my four-digit code to be a joint account. I said no because I wanted my own account and not share it.She asked a hundred times and the answer was always no. One day, I went on TikTok and for some reason, I was logged out of my account. I thought it must of reset, so I tried to log back in.It didnt work and it said  This phone number or email isnt valid. and it was weird. I decided to leave it a day before retrying. It still didnt work. I thought that my friend did it so I blocked her. Please fix this and remove my friend (FOR TIKTOK ONLY: ._.leigh_m._.) She doesnt deserve a TikTok account. Thank you.~Aimee"
DOWNLOAD IT. Omg guys this is the best app ever as soon as you download it you cant bear to delete it There is a lot of small creators out there who because of tiktok are now famous You can post whatever you want and watch others videos on the for you page (fyp) that tiktpk puts on there judging by what you search up and what kind of videos you like to post and watch. I recommend this app to people of all ages
"Cool but is addictive. I would say TikTok is cool and addictive becauseTikTok can waste a lot of your time on your phone and not communicating with family and not doing things in life say you have a dog and you need to give that dog attention but your on TikTok soooo that dog will be a sad doggo :( and plenty of other reasons,I think the reason its addictive is the scroll so you can just scroll to a bran new video also there has been some rumours about spying while users use and record on the app bit like Instagram I dont know if this is true or not.Other than that TikTok is a cool app and you can create videos and see other videos and other fun videos.This review was just my opinion please dont take it to heart"
TikTok. Such a fun and addictive app love making videos. You can put your account on private and have multiple accounts. Download it it is an amazing app
Spying. Its a Chinese Spying App
"Tik Tok. I love Tik tok but my issue would be that I have not received my update to have more than 3 accounts online at once every time I update the app from my App Store it is never the update where you can have more than 3 accounts. On a positive note, Tik tok is an amazing app and their privacy policies are very good and considerable. They always think of all ages and I would not have it any other way. But like I said I am still waiting for that update. And also some accounts are being banned for no reason. This happened to my cousin a few weeks ago and her account got banned for no reason when she did nothing wrong"
Tic toc. Its really really really good but privacy needs to be better
. This app hack your phone and emails and messages dont download
The worst app Ive ever encountered. I literally got 9000 followers then I got banned for saying I am a Muslim.... I deleted this app and its data  hope this app gets banned its all dirty videos anyways so I dont even like tiktok anyway
"Tik Tok. Tik Tok is very addictive and fun theres only one thing I do not like and thats how you need 1000 followers to go live maybe you could change it too like 500 I think its amazing overall Im very happy with the privacy settings as well you can see videos meant for you comment,like,duet,react (unless there private) that is my only issue my account is @..s3ri3s thats not my main but its the account with like 700 fans I really think you should change it to 500 its my dream to go live &lt;3"

Personal Reflection & Growth. I owe it all to TIKTOK for allowing to grow both personally and spiritually. I am encouraged to what may happen next both on TIKTOK and in my own life
Im scared. I dont like to know u have people spying on me through the app
China. The Chinese government uses this app to spy on you even if your not Chinese
My review. Tik tok is great even though the Chinese know all our information and could sell it to people but who cares its still a great app
"Why this app should work but doesnt. Tik Toks platform itself is a well done platform. The idea behind Tik Tok has been used by previous apps like musical.ly and Vine in comparable ways but its an old trope and sticks to a safe formula (which is good). The algorithm is a different story. This is where my criticisms come in. The algorithm heavily promotes young more attractive looking people to become more popular, its been proven in a series of tests, and its a known fact that has been stated by representatives before (in a dismissive way rather than sexist/racist/biased way). This is the first problem with the app, its a minor problem but because of this the app has allowed many younger teenagers to be exposed to the internet, is this the fault of the developers? Arguably not, however as mentioned before the algorithm promotes such behaviour and there arent regulations in the algorithm that seem to disengage these types of situations. This leads to my second issue with the app, which is the community of people using the app. A community is not automatically a bad community because if I were to look at every community I could easily say the same, however a community needs to be actively regulated in a way where respect and a sense of awareness is not only promoted, but praised, there is very little sense of this in the community. There are legal issues (the copyrighted music dilemma) about the app as a whole but as long as users are not being violated in terms of privacy. Besides this minor criticisms apply. I am aware that there are many great features and forms of innovation in Tik Tok, and I see a lot of potential in the app.But until Moderation is applied into the app that encourages these tropes I mention, and when the algorithm shows absolutely no bias and treats every deserving user as such, then this app will be near perfection because as mentioned before it has a lot of potential.I dont expect for the app to be perfect even after ALL of this innovation, but I guarantee that if these thoughts of innovation are added (on the high unlikely chance they are) this 1 star will very swiftly turn into a 5 star"
You are giving data to the Chinese police state. You are helping the Chinese police state
. my account got deleted for no specified reason. i tried logging in multiple times and nothing worked. i emailed ur app support many times and didnt get one email back. when i downloaded my data on that account i couldnt even access my videos after. it says zero kb so i bought icloud storage and still says the same thing. this is truely disappointing
Unsecure and very Sketchy app. They steal your information and what youve copied paste. Very sketchy app from our friends in China
Avid tiktok user. I use tiktok everyday to grow my personal and business brand and its changed my life
LLLLLOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL. This is Chinese spying app loooooooooool
love it. been on it for almost a year and i really enjoy it . people stop blaming an app for your personal issues. a kid friendly version would be awesome. there is one issue and thats messaging people live . lots of messages just wont go through. and just general messages like  hows your day  kinda messages.thanks
"Great app . I use this app loads and I can say its really cool. There  isnt a premium were you have to pay for filters or special affects, which makes it easier to use. In your settings you can switch your privacy so no one can see your videos, only friends can or everyone can.There are loads of filters that update and change nearly every month, there are slide shows you can make with pictures from your phone, theres slo-mo video effects, stickers you can pin to your videos, text to add and more. I have had this app for about 2 years and I have never had any issues. I recommend this app to anyone above the age of 11-12. I gave this app 5/5 thank you for reading. "
"AMAZING. It is soo good and very fun the ads u can skip at any time u want and the privacy settings make sure you can make videos as private or public as u want and u r allowed to make multiple accounts I love this app to have jokes, do dances and have fun"
Best app ever. It is so addicting Im on it 24-7 if you dont have it then you need to get it and there are no in app purchases all you have to do is download it then create an account and there you go and it private or public Follow me @slowbanana71              Or @maddie_1029

". Hey guys,       First of all just would like to say I LOVE YOUR APP Second of all the community seems to be incredible thus far.  Thirdly would just like to congratulate you on your overall success as a platform. Top notch to say the platform"
NO STAR. I heard that TikTok knows your personal information so I deleted it I HATE the creators because my friend said that they know everything about me and what I do on my phone so thats why I give no stars

"Company intentionally doesnt give Iranians access. Its the weirdest thing Ive ever noticed in an app as an app developer. So previously Id need to turn off my VPN to be able to use it but now even without the VPN it does not load anything This app clearly stores information about the unique devices that install it and then use them because despite my phone region and language and IP number all do belong to Germany, it still no matter how many times I install it again, it first shows me a video from my own country But only that first video and it doesnt load anything more Im frustrated and confused. Im thinking about the possible ways that these ppl behind this app not only have violated my privacy severely but also do not let me use the app for reasons I dont understand which might be just bugs...PS: the company is working with the Iranian terrorist regime in censorship efforts and has decided to not give us access to its crappy platform. I invite all freedom loving ppl to boycott this app and its fascist policies"
"Banned for no reason. The only reason I downloaded TikTok is because my friends are constantly texting me videos. I had the account maybe 2 months, never posted, never liked, never commented on anything. I only ever used it when a friend texted me videos. Well a friend sent me one and when it opened the app it said my account was permanently banned. I sent messages to support to see what happened, downloaded my data to see if I had been hacked and it said nothing was ever done in my account. Now I cant watch any videos. Just think its strange to be banned from something I hardly used. Just a warning, Be careful out there"
"Love it but gets super annoying. I love tiktok, it gives a great variety to ideas and i can keep up with my friends. As much as I love it, I also think it is very annoying. I have gotten banned over 20 times (Counted) and I have been very careful. I have made sure that I am not wearing any city names or saying personal info. I have made sure not to bully or show nudity in my videos. I am very positive towards others videos. I am not underage, I am 13 years old. Im not very happy with my experience right now"
Garbage. Its made my China to look on our data
Not over rated. Lots of people think tiktok is over rated well its not also there are lots of safety features you can put on tiktok to keep you safe. I got tiktok during lockdown and well lets just say I love it I am very cautious with my account and the privacy with it and its easy to have a private account or to put put the account on restricted mode
"This app is bad with bad people. This app has been sued for stealing information along with its community being pure trash, we dont want gacha life S$xOr near young girls twerking. People who simply wave their hands earn money.For both sides to be bad. I give it a one"
"Chinese Spyware that is destroying the West. Now I know I may be asking a lot, but do some research about the Chinese company Bytedance, the Chinese policy of state mandated theft of data from corporations and the fact that the US Government does not allow this horrid app to be installed on it\'s devices. Need I say more?You are addicted and it is shameful"
Tiktok review. This app is incredible I love it so much
Toxic application. LOMOTIF IS WAY BETTER.  Stop giving your data to China
I love tik tok. Tik tok is a very fun and social app which has millions of users and songs and dances and effects on it which makes it really fun to be able to connect online with your friends and you dont have to post on public because you can put your account on private if you wish. It is mostly safe but you can come across some inappropriate things sometimes but the age is 12 plus even though some younger kids use it. Overall the safety guidelines are very protective and they dont show you inappropriate or unhealthy things  usually on your fyp so every time you watch something it might assume that you like that video and show you it again. You can also like and share videos to whoever you want depending on your privacy settings and you can chat with your friends and people you dont know personally.Although I think this app it brilliant
Spyware. If you like being Spyed on go ahead and download
This is a great app. This is a great app its so fun to find life hacks and just watch the stuff people post
Chinese spies. You Are being watched when you used this app by Chinese spies
stop. please stop stealing users data and letting winnie see it thanks
Its addicting. WARNING this app is addicting when downloaded you have just sold your soul to China
"Great and very addicting. I thought TikTok was just kids dancing and lip syncing, but then I joined and realized it was much more than that. Love this app, even if it might mean letting China track my phone a bit"
Would not recommend. If you would like to save some brain cells while avoiding kardashian level attention seekers then do not download this app. Not to mention its full of privacy and data breaching software to access your files and devices. Nothing fun or entertaining about this app at all
My review on tik tok. This is my personal opinion on tik tok. At first I was not a big fan of the app it always made me boerd and I thought it was a dumb app. But once I kept the app for a longer amount of time I got obsessed with it and I now love the app. But if you are one of those people who does not like to spend so much time on your phone then I would not get the app. But for my opinion I love the app. The one thing I hate is that sometimes the people on the app look threw your profile if you have a public account but you can also get a private account and it changes everything. I hope you guys with enjoy the app as much as I did byeeeeee 
"Is this safe?. I started doing tik tok 5 months ago and my parents say that they will hack your information and take your money, is it true please reply I have being not having tik tok because of the reason. So please give me an answer "
"Is this safe?. I started doing tik tok 5 months ago and my parents say that they will hack your information and take your money, is it true please reply I have being not having tik tok because of the reason. So please give me an answer"
Noob here. I am a newbie and I am able to use the app like I know what Im doing. Also the information I can get is super fast
"-_|___^___|_-. These People Are Not Serious. I Have Submitted Multiple Reports On Accounts That Violate Inappropriate Link Code Of Conduct. All Those Accounts Hold The Same Violations, But TikTok Has Found Violations On Some But Not Others. How Is This Even Possible? All These Accounts Seem To Be Generated From The Same Individuals, Time And Time Again. They Keep Changing Their Profile Pictures, But The Links Are All Similar. They Are Aiding In Promoting Nudity And Prostitution To Lure In Account Holders. They Have Applied Age Restrictions On Certain Videos I Had Commented On, Just To Bar Me. How Is This Possible, When They Dont Know My Age? They Are Doing It Based On Assumptions. I Have Applied The No Mention Under Privacy, Yet They Have Made It Possible For The Same Individuals Promoting Nudity To Bypass The Privacy Security. Someone Is Paying Top Dollars To Infiltrate. My Best Guess Is YouTube  Alphabet, Facebook  Apple. There Is No Confidentiality"
TikTok info. I have been enjoying TikTok it is lot of fun and fun entertainment for kids and adults and you can also have control of your childs TikTok so I would really download this app for fun  10/10
Stealing Details- Scam. useless aap Chinese guys are stealing other countries Data
"TikTok. TikTok has come to the point when I would like to say its amazing app. I can make posts and watch others i watch my idols videos and my friends ones too With TikTok you can have multiple accounts wether they will be private or not it is an amazing app but very addictive, have a good one all"

STOP GIVING US BS ADS. Listen you absolute jammy dodgers stop giving me ads of Gordon Ramsay reacting to some cooking a 2 year old could do. And for the love of god stop showing me the good stuff you find after 3 hours of scrolling we all know its full of unfunny garbage that anyone with an iQ above room temperature will find stupid.No one except weird people want to watch all that trash dancing oh and before you say about helpful tips.You are the five-minute crafts to five-minute crafts.By the way most of the civilised world know this app is just China gathering and selling data thats why its free because consumers pay with theyre information. P.SYou will never be vine you will never be good and no matter what you do people will know what youre up to
"Banning accounts. They remove and ban videos for ridiculous reasons and simply state to look at community standards, yet the videos dont fall short of the standards. People spend long times building their accounts and the. have them wiped losing all their data and contacts. Its terrible"
China spys on you. It has been proven that this steals data. Tik Tok is cringe for thisEven then tik tok cringe
Til Tok. This app has brought so much joy and information to my world
Spyware. Highly successful and fun way to share all sorts of data
"Dodgy - run with the Chinese govt. Dodgy as, its run with backdoors to the Chinese government - do not trust with your data"
"if you dont have TikTok, what are you doing?. I mean have you been living unde a rock? This is the most incredible app of all time. Just get it"
TikTok is great. I love TikTok but I just wish it did not need data but besides that its very good to watch when your bored and just to have fun and make videos if you do not have TikTok download it NOW
The Chinese government is going to steal ur info. ;)
"Good but sus. Its a good app but it is sus when it said, Learn how we use,collect and share your data I find that weird but otherwise very good app"
Lol china hacking. Stealing my data innit
Great app. This app is amazing if you have 1000 + followers you can go live but you have to be 13 but u can make ur account private and if someone is following you and you are to you can chat with them and this Is a great app I recommend for you to download it
"Hey TikTok Remember me?. If you remember me which you probably dont, I reviewed my friends problem on TikTok, she is fine now and now Im on it Ive only been on TikTok for about a month I only follow my friends and this is such a great app. Theres just some things that annoy me, the little kids going on the app that just ruin it and somehow end up on my FYP? This is one of the things that annoy me but the rest are just me problems, Ive started to really like this app (not as much as my dad though) and its changed a lot since musically. Though, TikTok isnt for everyone, and it has changed a lot since musically, so if youre looking at TikTok, BEWARE it has changed. anyway, love your app, its incredible how many people use TikTok, hope youre doing good in this Quarantine we have, and see you next review I have.Enjoy TikTok will ya, luv ya.   We&#39;re sorry to hear that, could you please report your situation? Please do as follow:1. Tap on the profile tab on the bottom to open the Log in page2. Tap on the &#34;&#34;?&#34;&#34; icon on the top left corner on the Log in page&#34; We hear you"
"garbage. garbage, one star. If i could summarize this app i would say:App data stealing cringe"
Get rid of it plz. Deleting tik tok was the most best thing ive ever did No more racism and toxicness But this app is just straight up pathetic and toxic and racist and dirty There was once a video of a person commiting suicide live Just get rid of it cuz this is ruining the world and it funds many stuff such as the concentration camps in china which is just disgusting Also many classic songs getting turned into dances and being remixed ruined my life cuz ppl only know it cuz of tiktok and i hate those songs now-wait they shouldnt even be called songs Destroy the data stealing disgusting disturbing horrific terrible app Also my life has been ruined and this is responsible for shaping the worst generation of kids and teens ever
Terrible dont get it steals your data DO NOT GET. It steals your data
The most frustrating thing ive ever seen. Ok. Why is China stealing my information?
"Its an okay app. before writing this, i know some might get offended or mad so just know that this is MY opinion. Tiktok is an okay app. with time, it got quite boring, toxic, etc. most people are just there to bring others down and argue with them. Tiktok is boring now because it used to be a bunch of new dances every two weeks so everyone wouldnt get bored of doing the same old dances, now, i cant even listen to a tiktok mashup with hearing the same sounds every time. tiktok is VERY toxic. no one cares about antibes feelings and most jokes are just about someone being fatherless, motherless, and other offensive things that are personal. kids are on titkok showing their bodys to grown people and its gross. i think titkok should do a better job at projecting minor safety. I think tiktok is something that you can get addicted to very quickly which is why i deleted it.i think its better if young ones stayed off of tiktok, it can affect their mental health at a very young age. (why you may ask? hate comments.)"
"Love it but can you fix the age changing thing?. I love it a lot. App is amazing and I love making content for others to enjoy. But when I changed my age to my incorrect age on accident, I never knew that it would make you do certain things when your younger than 15. So I feel like you should tell a new person on tiktok about it before they change their age incorrectly then the weird privacy stuff happens. And also could I possible if I could change my age to my correct one please?"
"Love it. The appTikTok is a great app for kids 11+, full of funny videos, life hacks and beautiful art. Ive had it for ages and you can still watch TikTok without an account.AccountsIf youre hoping to get an account so you can like, follow and even make videos yourself - TikToks got you covered. If youre abit worried about your childs or your own safety you can make private accounts which on share videos to you and some of your friends with TikTok. This means with a private account you can decide who you want to see your videos, like a friend perhaps.Ratings The standards have dropped for a few people because music.ally turned into TikTok but Its the same app with a slightly different design. Restrictions You can actually get restrictions for accounts like your not allowed 2 accounts or you can block some TikToker who you may not like. This is just a choice if you want some restrictions for your child or yourself. My overall vote is 5 stars, and Id recommend it"
Tiktok. Fun and amazing apps for you to make your own videos or just watch.Wifi/Data needed Amazing app 5stars
Do not play from bendy. Do not play the app China is taking your personal information so warning dont get the app
PLS READ. WE NEED TO SPREAD THE WORD TIK TOK IS STEALING UR DATA
Inappropriate. Misleading people and gathering personal information
"It is good but. It is good I love making videos and looking at other videos, but I have heard that the Chinese Government can see where you are and can steal your data"
Chinese. The app is 100% helping the Chinese spy on us with any videos posted
"Garbage. Chinese spies, racism, pedophilia.... Get this trash app off the App Store"
Tiktok is addicting. Ive been having tiktok for a few years now and i love how my fyp is uniquely styled to fit what i want to see. Its easy to list track of time whenever i use thus app. I love winding down after a long hard day at work
Congratulations to all involved.

Tiktok. This app is the best site ever it has loads of supporting people some famous people do meet and greets because of this app they get famous and thats because of installing this incredible app its jaw dropping Trends and it is one of the popular apps to be made I m not that big but I still have peoples backs and support any one and every one
Not over rated. Lots of people think tiktok is over rated well its not also there are lots of safety features you can put on tiktok to keep you safe. I got tiktok during lockdown and well lets just say I love it I am very cautious with my account and the privacy with it and its easy to have a private account or to put the account on restricted mode
"THE NEW INBOX IS NOT OKAY. the new inbox is an easier way to envade your privacy, its really ugly and had already gotten alot of people off the app, i recommend you to change it back to how it was before tiktok gets a really bad rating. It has made MANY people ik cry and i personally hate the way tiktok looks now"
I would definitely recommend it but. I love tiktok I will recommend 100% but there is rude accounts and ye also there is hackers that find ur location and kidnaps u if u are not aware of it please be aware and stop this also these other people if u click thir bio they track u down please be aware and stop this tiktok I am scared for me and my family at this point so please stop it and then I will recommend it to everyone and yeah just be aware of these things
The Chinese are spying on us. The Chinese use this app to spy on us
Delete it now. Chin4 is spying you 
Tiktok. Its was going great til they trying to band my account for no reason. None of the video I post is harmful to nobody. Its straight props in the video and every video I do is entertaining and personal blogs sometimes and its for my fans and family and friends to see them
Its very addictive. I love this app its a great way to be entertained when you are bored. Its also fun to make videos but I just think it steals a little too much information from you like your phone number and email but I still like it 
"dont download it. my sister (whos 6 by the way) is completely addicted to this, shes constantly on her iPad or steals my phone to watch tiktoks, its dangerously addictive especially for young kids"
If I was you I would download this app. Its really relaxing to hop on TikTok and watch a videos
"Update is unfair + pointless. I made a fake birthday for privacy reasons, and now with the update since I am 16 and was born in 2003 tiktok thinks im younger and now I cant send messages.  Personally I think the update is so unnecessary as you can only message people you follow and follow you back so why is there such great need to now have age restrictions? My account better get fixed as i am not happy with the outcome of this"
"Enjoyable. I still dont manage all of it. My only concern is the size of data that occupies. The cache is small. But the memory on mobile is around 900MB. This is crazy, and I dont know how to reduce this"
Scammer. Stole and sold my data
Best app ever. It is so addicting Im on it 24-7 if you dont have it then you need to get it and there are no in app purchases all you have to do is download it then create an account and there you go and it private or public Follow me @slowbanana71              Or @hypehouse_stories326
Good but needs changes. Love this app but I think that there should be a kids version that isnt cringe but trendy that has the same videos just more age appropriate. My cousin downloaded the app (she is only ten) and all of her friends have public accounts and they dont know the dangers this is a serious problem for me and I think that there should be ads maybe for kids that are in the app (but shouldnt be) know about privacy settings
Stupid Ganga. This app is from China and there are secret spies . I now this because that said on the news the radio store like that and even dont post video still dont download dont blame on me if something wrong so just watch on you tube thats what I do
"toxic. ive always wanted to go on my personal side of tiktok but ive always ended up in alt tiktok and alt tiktok has a bunch of people who body shame,say slurs,racists -etc and most people think these things are ok so what i do is i block people who do these things but i develop more alt tiktok pages and i cant get rid of them-"
Bad. Worst app of all time its terrible dont download it also accesses a lot of your data and sends it somewhere in Beijing
"@guccimyamstaff. My personal account with my Amstaff Baby. Posted lots of videos, but happy I got (1) video that has 65k views . I love Tiktok"
"TikTok is absolutely amazing. I truly love creating content and other content creators, the owners of TikTok really out did themselves and I love posting my content to my friends and followers, this platform truly demonstrates how we as people can collaborate to make an Impact on people and make the world a better place. I can now show my talent and passion and cant wait to see what 2022 brings, Omg I cant believe 10 minute vids are here, incredible. Love it, I wanna see whats next"
I luv tiktok but I have a question to ask you. Are you Chinese people spying on us be honest plz
"They meed to get their priorities right. Yes tiktok is great and very popular, but they keep taking down harmless and innocent videos that dont offend anyone for such ridiculous reasons. Adult nudity?? Please i was fully dressed and didnothing explicit   at all, not even twerking - the sound i used had several videos of people being improper and explicit, yet their video remains up with millions of likes, in public for even children to see- but my FRIENDS ONLY video gets taken down??? Even small daily vlogs i make in my private gets taken down? Its ridiculous and unfair"
BTW theres Safety issues. With a private account and all of the safety Things for TikTok there are still people who hack on to your account and try to get ahold of young girls. If you dont want your kids getting kidnapped then follow the age thing
Download now. This app is so good it cost nothing and its reallly nice you can videos but there only one thing for everyone you have to be the age requirement or your is private and it doesnt change and its a nice rule because it blocks stuff from little kids.you can make followers and get verified download now
Apparently our videos are being viewed by the Chinese. I heard on the news that even private accounts the videos were being viewed be the Chinese. I dont meen that tic tock is a bad app but the people who make it are invading peoples privacy
"Bad, not necessary should ban this. Homophobia, transphobia antis-LGBT, racist and sexist app, sexualisation of underages girls and boys too, juvenile pornography and pornography video on few cases. No privacy, no really original, a obsession, a lot of people became dependant of this app, a obsession literally. Black Lives Matter scandals They are some positive stuff about Tik Tok but generally no I prefer delete and wish they ban this app rather using it. Sérieusement, je crois que cette application ne reflète pas la triste réalité mais elle montre que les côtés de la société rêvée dune certaine manière pour nous divertir. TIK TOK rabaisse les minorités, le racisme et la sexualisation des enfants  y est très présente, elle attire des prédateurs, cest très populaire des jeunes qui dance à moitié nu sur une chorégraphie plus ou moins vulgaire, surtout les jeunes filles. Les comptes à les plus populaire nont pas à travailler fort pour recevoir de largent, ils se font payés, Cest mal utilisé largent. la beauté, limage et la richesse est mise en avant sur cette app, donne une mauvaise perception aux jeunes sur la beauté et la confiance en soi, sur son corps (comme Instagram) le talent, les bonnes valeurs et actions est moins présents"
"FaceBook IS DEAD. Whats great about this app is all about the short ,quick video which makes something very personal about each post.  I hope Tik TOk doesnt blow it"
Not like. I got this app to make cool videos but I keep getting banned and it wont let me download my data Im getting angry with the app and its annoying me now so if I get banned 5 more times Im never using this app and telling everyone that its crap
"Amazing. Although I get banned for no reason on lives and that, but apart from that its actually a very cool app and one of my favs. So funny watching other ppl and incredible cause u can have private accounts for u and ur friends"
Remove the privacy thing. It is bad an stupid there is no button to turn it off
"Terrible app. No content moderation, probably just another way for the Chinese government to spy on the world"
Spies on you. Dontdownload this spies on you very good its a Chinese company that does it another company
"Ban s3x bots. Ive been getting s3x bots ALL THE TIME & the s3x bots have a link the link takes your personal info,Ik this because i can identify links.overall this app is amazingi use this app all the time"
Information. I love watching all this nice videos and a lot Info and new people with their stories
Awesome. I make tik toks and it is so fun they are some swearwords but I just ignore them and dont say them you can make your account private or public mine is private some people try to follow you but if you do not know them then do not except it if youre private I let all my friends follow me this is a really good app just ignore the swearwords and learn some dances and post them you have to show your face you dont have to dance you can do stuff like make bracelets and sell them or play with fidgets some people are mean and say mean things but you just ignore them dont listen to them
Tick to the tock. One of my favorite apps. I used To Utube Videos for information or to N gain knowledge on something  now its all tick tock. Used to Facebook a lot now N here
Awful. Awful app not gonna lie. So many privacy concerns and the layout of it is awful.:/
Tik Tok. The app is really easy to use and its a good source of vital information
"Inappropriate. I had this app before but I had to delete it because it was to inappropriate like with racism,hate,bullying,also they track you and steal your personal information and they watch you like if you see this like orange microphone and you like pull your screen down like you would to put on your flashlight or something it would say like caller unknown and it is very creepy and a lot more things happen to so do NOT get this app I repeat do NOT get this app it is really inappropriate and rude and weird/creepy"
Star quality. I think it is a 5/5 for tiktok as it takes reporting quite seriously and they respond back to u on the same day and the privacy settings are good also meaning people cant keep it to them and save them to there device and take credit for it. An saying that people can still screen record but it wont say they made itll show that it has been screen recorded
Amazing. This app is incredible you can post whatever you want and nobody judges you on skill or anything 
10/10 this app lets China spy on me without any hassle. Title
My true honest review. This is an amazing app I love it I can do roblox tick tocks and it is so cool I make them from CapCut it is tots free and it helps me be funny but for privacy I do not show my face because I am to worried and I am happy with not showing my face
"Best app ever. This app allows me to talk to my friends look and chat to people all around the world and theres live streams? WHAT tell me this app cant get any better but wait there are filters and effects and stickers,quotes and sound tracks you can add to your post and about the filters there are also super cut filter for your pets anyways 10/10 I hope TikTok can and always will succeed"
Hope it gets band. Tick Tock likes stealing info
i love tiktok . i do not wish for tiktok to be banned because it is my escape from the real world i dont do anything in life but go on tiktok because i cannot do other things. i spend my days on tiktok and without tiktok i dont know what i would do. this app has boosted my happiness and made me who i am i am more cheerful because of tiktok and i do not mind that china is taking my data or whatever it is DO NOT BAN TIKTOK
"Best app ever. This app allows me to talk to my friends look and chat to people all around the world and theres live streams? WHAT tell me this app cant get any better but wait there are filters and effects and stickers,quotes and sound tracks you can add to your post and about the filters there are also super cute filters for your pets anyways 10/10 I hope TikTok can and always will succeed"
"Plz make me go viral. Now I know you guys are a bunch of stinkies so can I go viral cause I gave you a five star plz?? That would be epic Btw can I have 1/4 of my data your probably selling to the black market?? How much money did you make from it because I want some Thatll be nice. Okie by tik tok,From Ceo_of_JellieThis is me again ceo_of_jellie Thanks for giving me a video with 11 thousand views I know this is a bit silly to ask but what about... 1 million?? I love your app even if it gets banned in different places Thanks youFrom Ceo_of_jellie"
Entertaining. Even though people say that this app is tracking our every day activities and were being tracked by people in China I still enjoy what this app and what it brings. its just for entertainment purposes only
suman_neupane02. My personal TikTok account this More views video please
My personal review. Good app safe and fun
IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD TIK TO KREAD BEFORE STARTING. TIK TOK WILL SPY ON YOU AND IT WILL HAVE TOUR PERSONAL INFO IF UR NOT HAPPY WITH THIS THAN DO NOT DOWNLOAD TIK TOK
Love tiktok. Very friendly to use and good information and very nice
Spy time. If youWannaStealMy dataYou gotta be an Australian based company
"I LOVED TIK TOK SO MUCH but i had to delete it for this reason. Tik tok was an app that i would spend most of my time on, everyday and every hour. Tho the only reason i deleted it was because of the Chinese government stealing all of our privacy or whatever. Please change this and if you do i would download it again-from an ex-tik tok fan"
Its interesting. I really love this mode of TikTok but its just that it consumes a lot of data thats all....But still withstanding I love it....
Trash. Shares your data with modern fascism
TikTok. Its really great Lots of amazing art tips and videos However it does make me lose track of time  I absolutely love how social everyone can be on this app  only downside is it kills my phone- FAST
Yall are stupid. I mean yeah its a good app but takes all our information to China oop-
Do youre part. Child pornography and chinese data mining. Please lets make it stop
TikTok. I like personal it should be 10 + and over
"Not friends only. Dont get me wrong I love tiktok, but when I post for my friends and change the privacy setting to friends only, other ppl whom I do not follow still see and like my content. Its really bugging me"
Fraud of a company. Farms data
Incredible. This app is AMAZING. I go on it everyday and its so fun to use and meet new people.but tiktok keeps not putting my videos on the fyp. Anymore :)
Dont not get this app. It spys on u. you know what and it see what your watching SO DONT GET THIS APP
Internet. It is good but ye have to use internet for it and when u go out and u havent go data you cant watch it but when u have got data you use it all
A private way to be entertained. I like the avenues that TikTok has to see new ways to see life differently. From wood and metal projects to personal feelings about health and mental issues
Its spying on you. And its also review-botter
"its awesome but. I wish you could keep the drafts when you log out of the account, Ive lost many good drafts and also please stop the links for kidnapping, for instance the Chinese people with the links in their bio track your ip and kidnap you"
"Tiktokisoverparty. Disgusted to see that many hashtags which support the black lives matter movement are unavailable to use. How is an app that has profited off of viral music made by black artists, silencing them at the same time. Also heard that this app steals your info so.. its a no from me"
TikTok. Its good I guess needs less  data
Steals ur data. Bruh
Spam. watching tiktoks for 53 consecutive hours really bums me out
"review. honestly i enjoy this app so much, im hoping its not chinese spy software but i would still use it, keep up the great work"
When I post its enjoyable. Such an amazing field of information Love scrolling through and also posting on my profile
Get rid of this communist app. The ccp are collecting tons of info from westerners
"Very toxic. Every time I look in a comment section theres always ppl arguing and judging other ppl for the most dumbest thing like the way text, the way they dress, what gender they are. Their sexuality, their pronouns, how their doing in school (even if ur doing good in school they still judge u), how old u r, what they believe in, what race are u, what games u like, ur personality, u the music u listen to, whats ur profile picture , and the list just keeps going on and on. It got to the point were I think theres no more nice ppl on this app. Half the  accounts on this app are  racist,homophobic/transphobic, and sexist. Pls stay away from this app its not good for ur mental health"
idea. i think tik tok should make a privacy option where you can chose who can dm you because i want my dms to be open to anyone not just people i follow back
"Suggestions and more. I dont suggest it for 11 or younger because its annoying, I see their videos on my fyp the lightning is bad and they basically do nothing and they don&#39;t know how to turn their account private and some of them are a brat because they make hate videos that includes their personal lives, I suggest it for 12 or older. But if your gonna make hate videos that includes your personal lives PLEASE do not say their name and make sure your account is private because its possible for them to find the person that you are talking about but I highly suggest to not make hate videos that includes your personal life. But you can make hate videos only for trump  So yeah I love TikTok because i can find stuff that I can relate all the time lol"
Ruins battery life. Constantly drains battery life.Consumes data constantly even when not in use. Very obvious it still running in background and collects your data in background

"Great app to put your self out there. Any business,personal or ideas, theres a place for them in this app"
"If youre getting this for a child under age 12, read this. Ok. I do not recommend this app for children. There are very inappropriate and scary things here, and you shouldnt let your childs videos be public. There are things that kids shouldnt see here. Kissing, swear words, nudity, etc. And, the people on this app can hack you, scam you, steal your information from your videos, I think even track you down. So, you should make your childs account private, and you should put a time restriction. But, thats what I think. You dont have to do that, I just recommend it. Thats"
"review. honestly i enjoy this app so much, im hoping its not chinese spy software but i would still use it, keep up the great work, ps get me on the fyp more often people will like me i swear. :)"

Great App. Really enjoying TikTok has so many information from so much people that are willing to share different opportunities and show you life hacks people wanting you to succeed pushing and encouraged by all. definitely recommend this app
Help. So tiktok is a good app but its very glitche overall great app but its glitche and theres bots that follow you and coment on ur vids and the pfp is asian woman but its actually old man and theres a link in there bio and if you click on it not only its tracks ur location but also you see dicks and boobs and stuff like that and yk I dont like it it really disturbing ....so yeah
"CREATORS TREATED TERRIBLY. I had an account @darthunicorn66 with 250k followers and was banned for platform security. Which never happens and is impossible. They wont tell me what I have done, they wont give me access to my data breaching GDPR in the UK and they always breach their own guidelines by banning creators for community guidelines, but then once you win the appeal the ban still stays in place . It is an awful place for creative people and they wont even answer emails, you just get ignored"
Its a really fun app. You can learn hacks in it you can watch short videos that are funny and you can make your own video as your own account and you can be famous person plus you can do it private or public your choice
This is an amazing app. This keeps me occupied all the time its so east to create videos and post them but I hate that it is going to be banned or sold pls fight for your rights 
Anti black. First off they steal your data. Also its a racist app but we always knew that. They blocked the #blacklivesmatter hashtag
"I love it here. Yes, maybe my information and my soul are being sold to some big machine corporation overseas, but the dog TikToks are worth it"
Best  choice to download Tik Tok. They have so much to expire you you can text friend and enjoy life hacks please download this app now
About TikTok. I love how you can make any kind of video you want Its so fun to see all the different ideas people have. Its a very entertaining app and lots of people love it And you can change settings to fit your privacy. Its so fun to make videos and watch them
You will learn. You are getting your personal stuff stolen by China
"Terrible app with security problems, with below subpar content. There have been multiple cases of, for lack of a better term suicide streams and all they do is ban the stream and call it a day without calling any parents or emergency services. Truly a terrible app, the content is completely effortless so dont expect a good time with this app. Not only this but the app has major privacy issues. In summary this app has moral and security problems not only this you are supporting this app despite the below subpar content"
"TikTok- amazing. TikTok is addictive and incredible, Ive never had a more enjoyable and entertaining app before Unfortunately, I have experienced some issues with bullying and accounts being taken down with no apparent reason"
"Great app, but. This app is truly remarking, and incredible, but I dont know what has happened recently. I am unable to repost TikToks. You might think this is truly something which shouldnt be reviewed, but it has been bothering me. All of my friends are able of doing this, and I am the one exception. They always talk about TikToks they have reposted which they have all seen, and then I am just there, because I cant see them. I have the app updated to the newest version, I have my phone done too, I dont know what is wrong Please give me a solution, Ive even tried to uninstall and reinstall the app. Still, nothing. Im left clueless, help"
Ok App. If the Chinese are spying on me thats pretty sad.
"phone numbers. just let us use phone numbers more than once or to access messages just use email, not the phone number. if u got 2 acc (private and public for example) is annoying not being able to send messages to ppl"
You should download it. Tiktok is the best thing that could happen to me you can make tiktok and watch ur friends and it is so fun you should get it
"Its great but. Its a great app, very addictive But I searched for something in my safari browser and the next thing I noticed that I started getting videos which were specifically related to my search on safari which is very weird. I dont remember allowing Tiktok to monitor my search history on safari. Thats a serious privacy issue"
Hi. Best app in the world 1000% should download now get it I will hack you Facebook account now 
Spyware. They were spying on youre clipboard until recently
its very good. but i am working so much for videos and it doesnt going in viral and for you and can you help me? user natro_data
"Dont download for your kids. There is some really horrible stuff on TikTok and I would advise you NOT to download it for your kids. It also takes up a lot of your storage and data. My kid saw and heard some really horrible stuff on there and I have deleted the app off his phone. Long story short, make sure your kids dont download this"
"Great free entertainment. This app is very entertaining and it is for free, could literally spend hours on it looking at others fantastic creation, great app, I dont care if its stealing my data as the app is free lol"
"Censoring and prejudice. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEYconsidered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
"Truly awful app. If you enjoy this app you are a glue sniffing imbecile, no argument. You let a horrendous company steal your data and infringe on your rights, you support an app that sexualizes minors and allows talentless, skill-less braindead bimbos to run the entirety of the popularity of the app"
"No. Please go away, its obvious that your taking all of our data and personal info"
TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL  One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Thanks
TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Thanks
"The best app. Tiktok is very funny, and I get a lot of information about what is happening"
Cool but lots of minor issues. Tik tok is fun but not my kind of app I dont really like how people do random stuff and it does not matter how inappropriate or anything they can just post anything I used to have it but then I deleted it because I was not very happy having it. I also heard on the news that tok tok is used to spy is this news true it is fun for some people but others not so much
The Chinese are spying on you. Used by the Chinese as an espionage device
Tiktok. Tiktok is my favorite app it&#39;s amazing some good reasons about it is that if you only want friends to see your videos you can turn your account private or you videos in friends only I LOVE tiktok get the app it&#39;s incredible 
"CCP (Cancerous, Cringe, Painful). Foreign spyware feeding all your personal information and habits straight to the Chinese Communist Party.Also the words used above and many more explain the type of content and the narcissistic people you will find on this app"
"Racist shadow banners. Your whole team is Black- Oppressive racist, homophobic, hating and crooks. You keep stealing my info to send to the Chinese Government, also, Im shadow banned because only me and 1 of my friends see my videos and it takes ages for 1 view. I will lawsuit you for theft of information and remember to Reply, because youre trying to evade me, I WILL CONTACT THE LAW WHETHER OR NOT YOU REPLY SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL"
Comment privacy?. It would be nice is You could it that certain people that follow you cant see anything you comment on
Tiktok is a good app. Tiktok is a amazing appp as long as you know hiw to use it. You can make new friends and even post videos of your self doing your doing your hobie or spreading you religion. While doing that you can recive likes on your videos and comments. Most all of them are nice snd friendly. Tiktok can teach you so much as well and help you build up personal skills
Spy ware. Tiktok is a spyware app it took random photos of me I am scared and creeped out please do not download this app one time took multiple photos of my scratching my penis
"TikTok Is Great But. hey i love this app but the sad side is the hate, it would be great if there was a second warning that pops up before you send for example, you write a comment. and a notification comes up and says &#39;is this hate?&#39; or something like that"
ITS A CHINESE DATA FARM. Its a Chinese data farm dont download this app unless you want Xi JinPing knowing your location loool
Tiktok rumours. I have been hearing tiktok rumours going on saying that tiktok is dangerous because it will take all of your personal details but I have had it for quite a long time and Im a bit concerned is this true?
Personal opinion. I had hounded TikTok in 2018 and never had a problem but now how ever my account is getting band and when I try to make a new ac before I have even watched / posted one vid I get band for doing absolutely nothing not sure If its a virus or anything .. dont get me wrong I love the app .. but would appreciate it more when it starts working
Love it but. This app has truly changed my life (by hibernating in my room watching tiktoks) but the fact this it might be going in some countries (like mine) is really depressing because everything TikTok has done for me is incredible... pls dont take it away stupid Australian government
"TikTok... I love TikTok, its so easy to just spend hours scrolling through all the videos when youre bored, sometimes I just play around with the filters and that keeps me entertained, you can really customise the app to your own personal liking, I Especially like the fact that you can turn on a setting to keep photosensitive videos off your for you page. My only problem about the app is the updates and guidelines, sometimes they dont listen to what the actual users of the app want and sometimes theyre just very stupid updates I adore this app but sometimes its too far, community guidelines isnt too good, there is a lot of bad things on this app that shouldnt be introduced to 12-13 year olds, other then that, my experience with TikTok has been pleasing"
Bad company. Tik tok mines for data they are a Chinese company and they deleted millions of bad reviews on google play store that say the same thing they are a bad company delete the app
"Used to like it. Fr when this app in 2018 it was golden. But heres why i rate it 1star and why u shouldnt donwload it. Its stealing your data, Content creators dont get recognized for skill, the only way you get on the fyp is if your a good looking person. Bet hey, your not going to listen to me, So have fun"
"I love it. This app is a definite yes, whenever Im upset I go watch some videos they always make me laugh. TikTok is a great app as long as you know how to stay safe, when you are ready to post a video you can change the privacy setting and I like that, you can allow certain people to see your vids this app is really good but the only downside to it is that it needs internet so you cant use it whenever. Anyway defiantly get this app"
"Creepy and disgusting. People. Stop posting DISGUSTING tiktoks. Like, who are you impressing? They were bikinis, and other revealing cloths. Another: Why I named this creepy is because of China people. They see your data and tiktoks. They are right now saying thanks cutie. Like disgusting. WHY DID YOU POST THESE KIND OF TIKTOKS. I AM SCARED FOR MY FRIENDS. THEY HAVE TIKTOK AND IM SCARED FOR THEM. Reminders: Delete tiktok and keep everything safe. (PS: DELETE YOUR TIKTOK ACCOUNT BEFORE IT&#39;S TOO LATE)"
Jay  and TikTok. TikTok is the best app in the world and if you get it follow me please @joeandjay8 Cousy I need more followers the best app in the wold and also when you get on my account make sure you like all my videos and hit share scroll over to other and hit it on all my vids.And also check my bio for information.Please get me more followers my aim is to get to 1k by my birthday and my is 31st of December so I can go liveBut my account is private and I done lots of videos .Still working on my  videos
"Direct Message. Hello Tik Tok , i understand that due to safety and privacy you have disabled direct message for under 16. I am 14 years old and believe that i am old enough for you to allow direct message. In my opinion you should lower the age to 13+ as that is the appropriate age to download the app therefore we should get the full experience. I believe that 13+ are responcible to use direct message  appropriatly and know how to block and report inappropriate useres. I hope you my idea into consideration- Zoe"
Great app. As a whole dont really mind my information getting sold to China
Get rid of it plz. Deleting tik tok was the most best thing ive ever didNo more racism and toxicnessBut this app is just straight up pathetic and toxic and rascist and dirtyThere was once a video of a person commiting suicide liveJust get rid of it cuz this is ruining the world and it funds many stuff such as the concentration camps in china which is just disgustingAlso many classic songs getting turned into dances and being remixed ruined my life cuz ppl only know it cuz of tiktok and i hate those songs now-wait they shouldnt even be called songsDestroy the data stealing disgusting disturbing horrific terrible appAlso my life has been ruined and this is responsible for shaping the worst generation of kids and teens ever
Entertaining. Great app for information
Good app. Tiktok is a very good app and since I have downloaded it I am loving it I enjoy watching the variety of content; I have had no issues with it
"Leaking drafts??. Uhh this girl keeps coming up on my fyp with no username and no profile. Apparently the videos are her drafts that tik tok has leaked. She didnt even know and hasnt been getting any notifications and this really scares me. I am deleting my account right now because of this terrible privacy policy, and will be disable the apps permissions to use my camera and microphone. I am very very scared"
U get banned for no reason. Chinese company wanna sell ur data thats it
Chinese spy app. YouTube software engineers dissecting this app to see what its all doing on your phone. Its all bad. Spys on everything on your phone and sends back to Chinese servers for God knows what reason. Its more invasive than the Facebook app. China is using it to spread propaganda and make all you Americans dumber. Its working like a charm Gotta go practice a new dance so I can post a video
Tik tok sucks. Tik tok is banned in USA for privacy issues I cant trust this they should get rid of it and ban it
"DOWNLOAD. Super interesting and fun things to watch , I love how the app customizes your feed to your liking"
"Tiktok xx. Absolutely incredible,a way to get people to express themselves,amazing app"
Alright. It is fun to watch and make videos but it has bugs like losing your account and loose all your data
"Its just a YouTube rip off. Why oh why oh why do people like this app. Its just rich teenagers doing stupid dances and making money in the process. Sure, some channels are creative but I wouldnt bother.On a side note this app as been fined by the US Government because they illegally stole childrens data"
Tiktok. Love Tiktok the only thing is I cant access my drafts anymore and do tiktoks when Im out and have no data
Waste of time. This app is one of many which is spoiling current generation. It makes young generation to spend time on making useless videos rather than going out and explore things or do some activity which helps their personal life. If you are committed to a goal in your life or if you want to achieve something then this app is not for you. To summarize this is WASTE OF TIME
DELETE IT. GUYS TIK TOK IS SPYING ON YOUwell how i...delete your account quick if ya have one Ok now how.i love tik tok but its a very very bad game bc they spy on you by: looking at what you are doing to please delete it I want u all to be safe so please believe me and delete it Im really scared that you all are going to keep being spyed on please DELETEIT
"Only favourites get on the for you page . Hi ( i am not going to write my name for personal reasons ) since I have had the tiktok app its been great really , but something i have found out is that only certain people get on the for you page . Some people work hard on what the upload on this app and I keep seeing the same people on the for you page . I am not just saying that because i dont get on the for you but come on TikTok  BTW : I am talking about this edit i made it didnt get on the fyp i took hours making it username : Webarebears_editz"
Why do this change. I hate this change so much that my account is private and I wanted to change my profile picture but no its private and I cant even unprivate it without privacy settings. Please change it back the way it was I really dont want this to happen
Grew my business. Best way to connect with people. On a person to person level. Great for expanding business etc I highly recommend this app for brand and personal development
The best. I love this app so much make 15-60 second videos and use timers filters etc make ur account private or pro it can be any account u want u can make up to four accounts on the same phone I defnently reconnect it my user is xx.leah.roblox.xx
Dont download it. Tik Tok is the worst app u can get It hacks into ppls social media Posts ur private videos and drafts And saves ur posts before I do I used to have tik Tok but I deleted my acc and the app coz it can access everything without ur permission trust me do not download it I dont think I want the whole world to see ur drafts or private videos especially hijabis like me who have private videos without a hijab and I would nvr want that to be posted pls dont download it its terrible
Career changing app. This has gained business and personal profile and loving being creative
Stalkers. I am on to you Chinese you find our personal info and you can find your account on google + you went in court for this why wont you close it down we have bigger worries like Coronavirus. You and only you are the reason that people all around are dyeing especially china you have the most deaths if you have TikTokDELETE IT IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE FOUND
Do not download. Massive data miners. Very immoral
"DO GET APP. I DO NOT LIKE THE APP  I LET MY 7 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAVE IT FOR A MONTH UNTIL I FOUND OUT SHE GAVE AWAY OUT ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER AND EVERYTHING . SHE WAS MESSAGING A MAN CALLED SAM FORM USA , HE WAS ASKING HER ALL OF OUR FAMILY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SHE GAVE IT AWAY  WE HAVE PHONED THE POLICE ABD THEY CAME AND CHARGED HIM SO LUCKILY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR 5 YEARS . BUT PLEASE THIS APP IS FULL OF PEDOPHILES DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN HAVE IT"
"Useless and stupid. Exactly the same as Vine, but with slightly longer videos. The app itself is a nightmare. Its so difficult to use (they dont give you any tutorial or hints or anything), they automatically publish your FULL, REAL name and it took me forever to figure out how to change it, the default privacy and security settings are extremely lax, the home part is constantly playing stupid videos from people I dont follow and dont want to, and finding any of my friends to follow is basically impossible. This app is just too confusing and difficult to use, and apps like Facebook and Instagram allow you to do basically the same things but in a much more user friendly way"
"ridiculous. ive used tiktok for years and ive never had a problem with it but the app started glitching so i decided to delete the app and re-download it. when i opened the app, it would not allow me to sign into my account. i tried to sign in using my email, number, instagram, google, and even apple but none of them allowed me to sign back into my account. i have so much data on that account that i would not like to lose, please help"
"Data-Mining Vine Knock-Off. In terms of the app itself its a great rip-off of vine and does its job decently. However the amount of data this app literally rips off your phone, including if you simply have the app downloaded and never open it. Is truly disturbing, and it seemed to pass under everyones radar cuz Red Man Sad Its Bad >:( so it must be good its really scary"
"Suggestions and more. Its great but youll have an serious addition But I dont suggest it for 11 or younger because its kind of annoying, I see their videos on my fyp the lightning is bad and they basically do nothing and they don&#39;t know how to turn their account private and some of them are a brat because they make hate videos that includes their personal lives, I suggest it for 12 or older. But if your gonna make hate videos that includes your personal lives PLEASE do not say their name and make sure your account is private because its possible for them to find the person that you are talking about but I highly suggest to not make hate videos that includes your personal life. But you can make hate videos only for trump  So yeah I love TikTok because i can find stuff that I can relate all the time lol"
Great app. Besides selling my data to Chinese child labor company tiktok is fun MTHEGAMER on youtube
Morgan tt review. I love this app I can see amazing life hacks when I have bad service I can still watch its amazing 
"Banned. I was permanently banned after logging back in for less than 24 hours. Hardly used it thought Id check it out and then received a notification to say all my videos will be ready to download, not been able to access any of my videos nor sign back up. I emailed to request more information as to why I was kicked off but I received no reply"
"Tik tok review. Best app I ever downloaded, lots of privacy and just a happy sight. Lots of support from creators such as charli damelio and her sister.... x"
"The problem. Suddenly,when I downloaded this it was completely fine until I deleted it because my dad might see me using this but when I installed it again i couldn&#39;t log in and it didn&#39;t let me use iCloud memory to get my data so I got my mum to enter her email but still didn&#39;t work so pls allow people including me do get tick tick with my data stored because I&#39;m on iPad and I don&#39;t have data recover"
china. willing to sacrifice my data for this app
"I love this app. Very interactive app, most people meet and know any kind of information. Too much fun"
"Chinese government oppression. Your company is based in China, and has strong ties to their ruling Communist Party. By decree of your own domestic law, you MUST share personal data if your government wish to do so. I will not support an authoritarian government that is responsible for the imprisonments of muslims in Xinjiang and the eradication of Tibet &amp; Hong Kong sovereignty. Your one-party state, restricted free speech, and oppression of minorities is NOT welcomed in a our democratic society"
Hi. This is the reddit army about to bring your racist spying app to one star
Straight fire. Take my data. The most addicting app of all time
"Read this befor getting it. Tik tok is an incredible app,its truly amazing and recommended,I know u have put a age restriction on the app but then I dont think the app should be used for women or men just using it for the sake of watching kids, and as kids we shouldnt be on thier but some profiles even say that their doing that. When I got the app I was so happy, I thought if I diddnt have this app I would be the odd one out,but now Im oftern telling my close friends to put thier account on private,as thier comment section is getting to inappropriate. I thought this app was about showing your talent and passion and it is, but u can get people that are way to revealing from to the way they dress and thier personal information and own problems, now were on to the subject  were not only can this be used for bullying its used for mostly hate, when I look on a video and on the comment section theirs  few nice comments, apart from that in my point of view its a good app but if your fairly young I would be carefull of what u type on the comment section as you will get hate and private account recommend, other than that get the app and explore it ?"
SO GOOOOD LOL. this app has relatable content for any age. it&#39;s great because you can have a public or private account too. you can make your own videos or watch others. i sit and watch videos for HOURS on tiktok. there&#39;s effects and filters to use when filming
It steals ur data. Dont get it steals ur data and if u still get it I hope ur data gets stolen
No more data stealing china. I no longer want to endorse anything that steals data specially by a chinese product. Thank you so much
Logging me out. This app is an incredible app but one thing that has happened to me is that my account has been logged out and I have lost all of my videos which is very annoying
Delete TikTok. ChINa is Herrera to spy delete it quick
". Well, whats not to like. Yep, probably a data mine.  You think your info isnt ALREADY out there?  Regardless, glad I downloaded it during this pandemic. Its been a life saver. "
Tik tok review. Dont like it. Had to delete because someone got hold of some of my information. 
"great app. its is a great app and all - very entertaining, but apparently it is spying on iphone users. Should i be worried?"
Too many Hackers. I dont know if these are hackers that work for TikTok or there just hackers that hack random accounts because my Instagram account got hacked the day after downloading and making a account for TikTok
"Do not download, please. I used to love this app but its now just too dangerous There is murdering now and peopke tracking others IP and killing them :( HATE HATE HATE THIS"
"New to tik tok. I enjoy TikTok for laughs, hacks, love and recipes It is a great way for me to learn new dance moves and hear good music I hesitated at first bc I was told your identity would get stolen, but Im so glad I downloaded it I have truly enjoyed it"
It has a dark side to it. When I decided to download tiktok my first video was very gringey and weird so I decided to delete the post when I got older and realised how gringey it was now to the twist and bad part  If you have tiktok for a long long long long long time you may have realised some inappropriate content I know I have wich is why I decided to delete it but then I got older and more bored so like the incredible personality inside of me I got the app again .but honestly I had to show my mum several videos I had seen with inappropriate or scary stuff it was the bad type of incredibly horrific because I am obsessed with scary stuff but it was like not good kind of scary and I know all types of scary so I deleted it when I found out that a very extremely piece of content had been shown on a live stream that I will not mention so most of you will get the first impression It has on your life but other than that its amazing so it is  a very good app so feel free to download 
Think its gd... ye i think its gd n stuff n like how it includes privacy n yh lyke dnt make tiktoks but i watch dem cs its acc sooo addicting n stuff buh lyke its a gd app n is gettttinggg sooo populare lyke all dees celebs getting it. buh lyke one thing to mention is dat theyre r lil kids on dis app lyke 9 yr olds noo liee..n sum ppl posting bare inappropriate stuff evn swearin theres so much n evn in comments AND also dees ppl doing sum inappropriate weird dance moves or wtvr not cs there r kids on dis app but cs they r like only 12 n dey doing it n acting as if theyre 18 or smn lyke mans gotta act theyre age ykykyk. anyways ye its strange buh gd....????? i think maybe have a guideline n take down nasty comments n any tiktoks that arent suitable for theyre age
Incredible. This app is sooo entertaining and is safe for kids if the have a private account
"Awesome. Love this app, opens my eyes to information I wasn't hip to, way better than Facebook but don't tell Mark"

Tick-tock is the best. Tick-tock is the best app you can ever have like it just shows your real talent and you can have it on private if you dont want people to like they can just follow you and see all your videos and that its just incredible I dont know how people dont have is that what everybody should have this app because people with diseases still go on it and some people do say rude things well I blocked those people and everybody should love the people that bully animals about how they look and help people get bullied about how they look its disgraceful but tick-tock shows at all its incredible and there are a lot of people with disabilities on here its just amazing how people can share their real talent some people maybe maybe get a lot of likes on TikTok but it doesnt mean that they are famous cares if theyre famous at least youre showing your account talent can I please go live though
Hours of entertainment. Hours of entertainment plenty of privacy options &amp; topics
"heres the thing. tik tok used to be incredible. like i adored it and i used to spend hours on it. however, now its become so incredibly draining. its a nightmare, everything is an argument on that app. its ridiculous it doesnt stop. i used to be able to recommend it as a full course meal  but now id say it comes with a side of hate speech, racism, torys, misogyny , double standards, pick mes and so so much more. download at the knowledge it will lose its novelty very very quickly"
Hackers. Chinese are spying on me with this app 
Chinese Communist Trash. Its owned by a Chinese company which in turn has to give the Chinese Communist Goverment access to all the collected data and information. Its a huge security breach threat in how much information the CCP can collect and especially about you. China has banned all the western social apps in order to control and brainwash its population. Its time all Chinese social media was banned oversees because they are an actual big problem
The China will steal you info. China will steal you info and find young people like you so dont install it. The pedos are watching
TIK TOK IS THE WORST APP EVER. TIK TOK STEALS YOUR INFORMATION AND SENDS IT TO CHINA. DONT GET. THEY SPY ON YOU THROUGH THE CAMERA WHEN YOU ARE ON AND OFF THE APP. THEY CAN WATCH YOU
 BEWARE STALKERS . Tik-Tok is good but the Chinese Government can STALK you and hack into your files. Dont download this  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

"Where to begin. Is it actually the TikTok app that is good or its creators, or both?I love this app, from head to toes( which is probably a song because they have a wide range) Speaking of wide range, that also have every type of person imaginable, from people who are part of LGBTQ plus to well as I said everyoneDownload it now, hop on the trend bus as you wont regret it Still feeling unsure? Check out these as TikTok is a great way of you getting all of the negatives of the profs situation out of your mind from a couple of hours that will feel like minutes Below you will see an example of a dance, comedy and the last one is my personal favouriteTo get access please search and this may sound weirdFor the first one- best TikTok for new people Second comedy.- search the user myonlycomedy And my final favourite TikToker is- search for StevenmckellRemember all one wordTik tok is a world away from ours, it is like us really people, real humour, the only difference is the virus that dominated right now This was written 18/05/20"

Nells Opinion. It is very good also it takes up all my data
I hate it. I was in tiktok but i was getting spy on in my privet chat that why I hate it
This app is amazing you can watch whatever . Download it if you havent
"Whats the deal?. Tiktok. Land of short and funny videos. You can meet with friends, and gain followers.I dont see why this is popular, honestly.Kids are selling their data, mouthing to 18+ songs and letting the app suck their life out of them.Seriously, TikTok? Could you just make a TikTok for KIDS??? I dont wanna have to deal with my friends not hanging out with me anymore and abandoning me for TikTok"
Tik tok. Tik tok is so fun you can make short videos and learn all types with trends and dances you can also promote your business you can get likes follows and for those of you who like privacy just change your setting so over all this is An addicting app and is super give it a try
Do ahead. Kinda selling are data to people
Chinese are hacking us it trust tik tok. Dont download Chinese are using this app to hack people from different countries and steal their information lots of other countries have already banned tik tok because of this they know where u are when you post a vid for proof look it up my friends account got banned after she posted a video about this
"Toxic community and spies on you. It says it all in the title, Reddit is better, you should research it"
"Horrible app. Horrible app, not funny, they sell your information and they let little girls show their body in bad ways. Its gross and its a garbage app"
TikTok I love your app its my personal favourite. In my opinion TikTok is the best app in the world
"Its incredible. Having something where I can share my personal life with others and make a following is extraordinary, this app also has really funny creators which make your day, the only thing bad is all the hater but thats gunna happen anyway, just how it goes"
No. The Japanese are hacking. And theyre tracking people theyre tracking their ID codes they know like where people live and theyre literally kidnapping them so I recommend that you delete this app and never get it again delete all of your accounts if you dont want to be kidnapped delete your account you do not want them to know who you are and honestly some stuff is really bad on there on TickTock I know like everyone wants it because Im Charli DAmelio chase Hudson little hottie Addison Rae and everyone is just all over them but you dont understand that people are tracking us I am really disappointed with this
Epic app. This is where ad dollars will be spent for the next 5 years. If you post consistently this app will reward you. Incredible conversion considering selling digital products with link in bio. Great for small business
ITS CHINESE SPYWARE. ITS SPYING ON YOUR KIDS
Malware. App is just Chinese malware accessing information on your phone
Tremendous App. Great for learning news Information. This a creative app that allows amateur video recordings to look amazing
"Fake. Chinese spy app, they released and let so many fake videos propaganda against Ukraine , this app clearly showed they are working for Chinese govt and they taking aide with Russian. , All Americans please delete this spy app ASAP Don\'t be dumb"
Excellent. This is a great app for people who want to show off their talent or just to have a bit of fun on.  It has a great privacy setting that will stop anybody who is not following you or is friends with you from looking at your creations.  I love using this app and watching what other people make and I definitely recommend it
TikTok. Just a fun App. Some information also
Follow me when you get the app. Hailey.hack. Ive had this app since 2018 and Im so obsessed. This app is very addictive but I love making new dances and watching others people content. You might need to make screen time after you download this app. You will laugh and you can even share with your friends. You can have a private acct if you want to. It doesnt matter what you do on the app you will have fun. Make sure to follow me when you download it
I LOVE THIS APP. This app is the best everyday I scroll on this app and lose track off time its an app for everyone and you can do your own thing its amazing
Good but some bugs. Its abs amazing app But I cant seem to repost or pin anything on some of my accounts and I cant turn it on in settings/privacy?
Haking app. Its gona hack your phone dont use this chinees app
"Smh. A cringy app that steals information from innocent children, Tik Tok is a manipulative manifestation of everything wrong with online video making"
". Hey guys,       First of all just would like to say I LOVE YOUR APP Second of all the community seems to be incredible thus far.  Thirdly would just like to congratulate you on your overall success as a platform. Top notch to say the platformSincerely,The.BudBuddha"
Good when on WiFi. When on WiFi it works perfectly amazing app.When not on WiFi you obviously cant look at anyones posts other then your drafts.If you have data though it seems to be a recent problem for me now that Tik tok doesnt work on data.You need to get this is fixed because occasionally it works in a car but not in my new house where we dont have WiFi yet.Its not signal because I have 2/3 bars and thats surely enough.I have 60 giga bytes stored of data and have only used 2.3gb so I have a sufficient amount.Its so confusing Tik tok sort this out.Other then thats its alright but I rely on data
It watches u tho. Tic tok is run by China who steal your data which scares me lol
Follow @stefanlink24 for fishing videos. Decent app to waste data on
"TikTok = The Worst Thing Humanity Has Created. TikTok shadowbans BLM supporters, people dancing get more likes than actual good content, people are very disrespectful and rude with such things like Autism Challenge, there is a lot of inappropriate content, and TikTok can spy on you. These are just a few things to name. Do not download TikTok/uninstall TikTok and if you dont mind, please write a review talking about these things to help this cause. I learnt this by others reviews and I hope you can learn something from mine. Thank you for reading"
Suggestions and more. Its great but youll have an serious addition Also I dont suggest it for 11 or younger because its kind of annoying because I see their vids on my fyp the lightning is bad and they basically do nothing and they don&#39;t know how to turn their account private and some of them are a brat because they make hate videos that includes their personal lives but beside that its great I suggest it for 12 or older. But if your gonna make hate videos that includes your personal lives PLEASE do not say their name and make sure your account is private because its possible for them to find a person that you are talking about but I highly suggest don&#39;t make hate videos that includes your personal life I also suggest that you can make hate videos only for trump  So yeah I love TikTok because i can find stuff that I can relate all the time lol
"#19. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators.

"Fun but posts get flagged for no reason. Love the platform, not sure about the security/warning data. My posts have been taken down & flagged sensitive content for no reason. Ive got one on my page right now that I messaged about. Its not sensitive by any means and Im NEVER inappropriate. Just an animal lover posting all of our hobby farms fur babies in the cutest way possible"
Hai. Hey it is Lucy and I love tiktok but i wish everyone can be verified because that would be even more amazing even if your account is private
Written by CCP?. I know you have all my data alreadybut whatever
"Garbage, like the chinese cunts who made it. You like having your information farmed and sold to chinese cunts? By all means download this garbage"
Do not get. If you dont live under a rock you know this app is a chinese spy
An awful catch. The app is a good way of entertaining yourself but they take dangerous amounts of data- making Hing Kong and America ban it. They also apparently fund awful things like the torture of the Muslims in China and people in Mynmar
Tiktok. Tiktok is the best app ever Im not even lying.  This app is incredible 
Tiktok. I have fun watching funny videos and educational information from health professionals
The bomb. TikTok is amazing its a app where you can socialise with your friends and family on a private account or you can have a non private account and show millions of people around the world your talent. Ive had this app since probably a year before it turned from musically to TikTok and I highly recommend this social app if want to share your dancing skills. Also finally dont download this app without permission if you are under 13 because people on here ( the TikTok company does not) hack and steels your info. But in my opinion TikTok is an Amazing app
Not good. This app is a spy
Uninstall plz. They taking your data
Tik tok RULES. Tik tok is a way of looking at how other people's life's are going and I haven't got it yet but I have seen how talented people are on tik tok like charli d'melio and the Norris nuts. It is a fun way to explore life and have fun doing itTik tok is also dangerous as someone could online-bully you or be mean to you online it is dangerous as you could get hacked and post something that's private I love this app it's amazing you should totally get it 
Tiktok. I think its an incredible app You can text people and its just a great app I love the amazing songs and dances
Bad. Plz make this app better I think I got hacked because I want to Talk to my friends through the app but it keeps saying number already registered but I have never used my phone number So plz fix this app I will give u 5 stars if u fix it
Yeah. They require so much of ur personal info. They are gonna start making you pay for views. There are so many toxic ppl on it. The endless scroll gets u addicted. Its hardly funny and Ive already lost my sense of humour using it
DOWNLOADED THIS APP NOW (TIKTOK). Just download the app and you will know what Im talking about it would make you want to log in to it and make some cool dances and you can also put your acc on private or friends only or public trust me its really fun thx for reading this btw 
"My review. I installed this app when I was in grade 5, but thats not the point. I would not recommend this app for anyone... no matter how good it is because as we all know, (this is common knowledge) China is using this app to spy on us"
TikTok is fun to watch. You can spend a whole day watching this app but you wont notice but I recommend you downloading it
"Wont be downloading again. I was about to re download this app.. until I read all these comments about shadowbanning specific types of creators (Black and LGBTQ+). Im good on the subtle racism and homophobia. Not to mention its privacy problems. It 100% always is listening, things I know I havent Googled or looked up on any other apps shows up in my FYP (ex: a video came up on my FYP on how to get rid of cold sores, when I was complaining about one for a couple days, yet never once searched in any app or Siri or any of my devices. This is just one example, I have a few). Its addictive for sure, as people are complaining.. but my main reason for such a low rating is the Shadowbanning and privacy issues"
Wanna give ur private information to china?. Yeah okay people are actually selling their private information to china so uhhh yeah if u wanna sell ur private information to the chinese government then download this yeah
Best app ever. Love it totally addicted and great information sources about real news on here
Good but. Its ok well good but sometimes it gets a bit annoying and it takes Dow ALL of your data and you have to do passwords and every thing to get an account and if you like a song and you want it but you dont know the name it dousnt  tell you and you can get hacked on your account Just  annoying
Garbage. Its made by China to take our data
This app is incredible. It allows me and my follows to all communicate I mostly love it because all of my idols post. I think this is a great app
This is cool. This is cool even though its a spy app from China
Get rid of it plz. Deleting tik tok was the most best thing ive ever didNo more racism and toxicnessBut this app is just straight up pathetic and toxic and racist and dirtyThere was once a video of a person commiting suicide liveJust get rid of it cuz this is ruining the world and it funds many stuff such as the concentration camps in china which is just disgustingAlso many classic songs getting turned into dances and being remixed ruined my life cuz ppl only know it cuz of tiktok and i hate those songs now-wait they shouldnt even be called songsDestroy the data stealing disgusting disturbing horrific terrible appAlso my life has been ruined and this is responsible for shaping the worst generation of kids and teens ever
"i love it. even though there were many changes in the app, it just got better, dont make any rash decisions though, there arent any cyber bullies on there that affect peoples lives heavily unless they do something bad such as say the n word as a white person, there is mild swearing on the app but i am 12 and enjoy it a lot, it has adult humour but its fine, if your child doesnt get the humour it will not cause any harm, no scary videos often on the foryou page, it recommends videos fit for the ones you have liked, such as the same creator or same sort of content, aside of new videos and new ideas popping up, the privacy settings are helpful as you can have a private account and you can turn off comments to avoid hurtful words, you can also make only friends comment, and you can hold down a video to dislike it if it causes any discomfort, i have been on since musically and it is healthily addictive, funny and something to do during quarantine, if you have any questions feel free to ask, enjoy the app, i recommend this highly "
Love this app. Great place to share information and to learn from others. Can get lost for hours in the videos and need to remember to take pee breaks 
CCp number 1. Spys on you tracks everzthing about you
Let me change my birthday. Its stupid that it makes it so when you are under 16 (15 year old here) it automatically outs your account at the privacy settings. Its stupid
The best app. Its a good app you can watch videos and send videos  download tiktok now
"Tik tok is the best app I have ever used in my lyfe. Tik tok is by far the best app I have ever used whilst Ive been on planet earth. I love everything about it, the features, the algorithm, the set up and EVERYTHING Tik tok is honestly the most incredible / amazing app that exists. By far the most creatively placed app thats available to absolutely everyone. This allows everyone and anyone to become creators, which is vastly different to other social media platforms. With Tik Tok everyone is equal thus, removing pressure to have a contest for technicalities. I cant speak higher of Tik Tok I dont know what Id do without it. I love it I hope its around until the end of the universe. Thank you Tik Tok I love you "
TikTok review. I personal think its a amazing app but they take down some videos for absolutely no reason
"Just get it already. Ok so, at first I thought tik tok was the most stupid thing ever and I only had it to see the viral vids like the hit or miss meme but now, (months later, its like the best app on my phone Its funny, I meet friends, learn dances and the privacy settings are really great"
No name ?. I like the app but the only thing is that I dont like that you need to have a certain amount of followers for you to go live. I also think that it would be better if you dont need data or Wi-Fi to use the app because what if your having problems with your Wi-Fi and you run out of data what do you do and what if the problem youre having with the Wi-Fi cant get fixed until the end of the month and you get your data at the end of the month. That means youll be waiting a whole entire month for you to make one video. Which is kind of a bummer
"A fun app for DIY mostly. Beware of data stealing. As with any social media app, user beware. In general, easy to use, effective tool for sharing time lapse and short videos. Happy to be using it productively"
TikTok review. TikTok is a great app and is very good for literally any time you want to be occupied and having fun TikTok is a great place to create your own cool vids and make amazing cool content that will be shown to others where it can be liked and commented on this is optional though TikTok will also give you the option to make your account private this means only the people you allow to watch the video can watch it
"Download right now. It has Everything From stories,to life hacks,cool videos,Food,sports and etc if u dont download I would be sad for you"
Dont band tiktok. Are they spying on us??
"Horrible app. This app is owned by a Chinese software company so their most likely spying on you, secondly its and app for people to jerk off to under age girls"
Hours of entertainment. Hours of entertainment plenty of privacy options & topics
Inappropriate. Tiktok used to be a fun and kind app with no hate but now times have changed. There is so much drama and hate going on and the app is less fun. I have to say that lots of people have become very age inappropriate considering it is a kids app. I would like the app to be removed based on the conflict and competitions. Please remove this app. All of the spying on us is so bad. I hate this app so much so please remove it in Australia Im sick of it and its not causing any good. Please remove this app ASAP because it is not safe at all. Not to mention all of the dangerous and scary things like people forcing you to self h*rm and plus u dont know if Addison Rae is a 40 year old man stealing information off of you. I do not recommend this app if you want to stay safe and stay happy so please remove this app immediately. BAN THIS APP IMMEDIATALY
Maybe. Tiktok updates too much and most of the updates I dont like like. This post to story its useless and unneeded. Why cant it just stay the same I mean in general its wonderful but can u not post as many updates as u do?Honestly no offense are u trying to be Snapchat?Also the post button to record a video doesnt need to change. I get you spend a lot of time doing this and keeping track of your app but its would be best to please remove this updated.. Of course I dont mean to be offensive but some of these updates it take me days to understand
"unfair bans. they keep banning my account for reasons not even against their privacy policy eg, I am banned from commenting for one whole month for saying when hes and thats it"
"TikTok. TikTok is a great app to express your feelings. Ive met most of my friends from just a video. Its INCREDIBLE. I love it sm, you should definitely download"
"Absolutely lovely . This wonderful app is for all ages, and for different personalities. It has kept me busy and in touch with my friends. I recommend for anyone who enjoys sharing what they do either as a hobby, or a job. Even for people who just need to consume time (also my account is called Richard_the_.goose... please follow )Edit: okkk so just now, tik tok its the working. And I know its not my data or wifi because I just got my monthly data update. All of the videos are paused. I can look at comments and the first second of the video. I can also scroll, but none of them work. Please can you fix this? As you can see from my previous review above I enjoy this app much Im almost certain its form your side, if not, please contact me and Ill see what I can do"
"great app, kinda creepy. this app is amazing, great algorithm and all that, but it does hack personal data and things, which is creepy. still awesome tho"
FIX LOGIN ISSUE. Its a nice app but it has logged many users like me out of their own accounts for no reason even when they are of age and when they try to log back in with correct info tik Tok says the information is wrong please improve this for i have lost my account
"Dont install. This is the most biased app Ive ever seen, you have to have looks or nearly die to be noticed. And not only that but google is deleting comments to make the app look good. TerribleNot only that but its full of chinese communism collecting all your data and selling it"
Tiktok. I love tiktok because it is amazing and you get to choose if you get a account or not you can make your account private so only your friend on tiktok can watch them you can also watch other peoples videos and it is just generally amazing I recommend this app to anyone and its fun so go try it out and download it for free now
Nervous. I heard Donald and Bojo want to ban it because it looks at data and its from China
Do not download. They hack into your phone dont download it Im not kidding
China takes your data. Do you trust them?
Dont an tik tok. They dont steal info thats only what Karens and boomers day
Chinese Spyware - dont download. This app spys on your phone and sends it to china Do not download it
Highly inappropriate. People who are black are getting shadow banded. The Chinese own TikTok and their stealing information such as email passwords and more  Dont get its not worth it
No one. No one likes the Privacy restrictions based on age If we cared about privacy we wouldn't have a public account to begin with
TikTok. I would say TikToks a great app but its not letting me watch my private videos
"Chinese or Russians. This app is unequivocally the greatest social media experiment gone world wide craze. Forget Rona..TikTok was the first universal pandemic.I refused to sign up until very recently because I herd somewhere that TikTok was just a play by the Chinese or Russians to get Americans personal and political info, pictures etc..well even If they now know I cheated on my student council speech in high school and hid joints in my sock drawer its completely worth it. TikG.O.A.Ttok"
Tiktok review. Tiktok îs a good and Funny app to downloade you can make videos and watch videos that you like to watch you have the opportunity to post whatever you want and it can get likes or even views download now
A life-saving app. This app inspired me to become a content creator I made wonderful friends and I have amazing followers I hope this app doesnt go away because it helped me through a depression that was eating away at me... and because of this app I was able to let out personal stress about the world I live and literally it saved my life so Im grateful to this app and I hope it never goes away for other people that are looking for outlet or just want to be able to express their creativity
Tiktok. Tiktok is really good for life hacks so you should download it
Finally I found my platform. Hi TIk TOK random person or bot Happy to provide a review. I am loving the whole experience so far. Truly. I like games and puzzles and you are a great game and puzzle.  I have a personal mission to help create peace in my circle of influence and hope one day to crack the codes of your mysterious game to get there and make a bigger difference in the world.  Lets do something meaningful together.  What do you say? 
". Hey guys,       First of all just would like to say I LOVE YOUR APP Second of all the community seems to be incredible thus far.  Thirdly would just like to congratulate you on your overall success as a platform. Top notch to say the platformSincerely,Poke_Flow name change in new year"
"I love this too much. It took me a long time to finally get a TikTok, and I still dont create anything, I just enjoy the content. But TT content creators are absolutely amazing and underrated and its really an art form. And I talk to coworkers and friends who arent on it and they think its just another Twitter or Facebook And Im like no, you dont understand these tick-tock artists are writing acting directing and producing these mini short films in an amazing vast array of fields. The are amazing. basically everything you can possibly imagine and its whatever tick hole you decide to fall down and theyre all fantastic rabbit hole. I dont know if its secretly a spy device for anyone but its a beautiful expression of the best of humanity"
"Middle of the road. Like all social media, theres good, and theres bad, and sure its Chinese spyware, but thats like saying I only Wanna be spied on by Google, Facebook, Twitter, my smart home, my car, my phone, and my discord"

"Fun, but DANGEROUS (parents pls read). Hello, if you are a parent or anyone who wants to know if this app is save or not, please read until the end There are many problems with TikTok that makes the app extremely inappropriate and dangerous. I used to have TikTok but I deleted it due to these problems: TikTok tracks basically everything about you Look in the privacy policy to find more info about what they can track. Next, very inappropriate music that can be insulting and rude that wouldnt be appropriate for certain ages. Some of the dances are also inappropriate and can be a bad influence on people. Famous TikTokers make people think that they are below them and can make people insecure. TikTok challenges are the worst. Some of the trends or challenges can injure people or cause them to pass away. On the news, someone died from trying to do a challenge from TikTok. Next, there are many stalkers that watch people and can find out where they live. Lastly, there was recently a trend about people going to start school shootings. Like how is that even a trend? That is dangerous and not something to joke about. As you can see, people take advantage of TikTok and make it this way. Yes, TikTok can be fun and safe in a few ways. Some people use the app as a creative way, like cooking, or art tutorials, and funny things. Things that people can actually enjoy without being in danger. But most of tik tok is bad. I do not recommend that his to anyone of the ages 14 and under"
The best. Tiktok impressed me and takes up most of my data
"Garbage. This app is garbage. It will collect your data and once you put time into it or build a following or presence the pressure and control begins. I was blocked for comments Ewww and later Dark is delicious. Neither which was used or intended in a negative context. People swear, bully, and sexually advertise on this app all the time. Hypocrisy of a garbage app. Banned from my life. "
Tik tok is a really good app thumbs up . I love tik tok  So much because I learn dances and hacks . I share the app with my friends at school and its just for fun but Im learning more I love tik tok so much its the best app Ive played on and I have over 4320 likes WOW  Its not about the followers and likes its about having fun Im not bothered if Im not viral Im only 10 so my account is private and I should not show my identity I hope you guys enjoyed my review thank you tik tok
App issues wont display same info other countries. Followers information regresses every few weeks app lagging.. takes awhile to load whether wifi or cellular brand NEW iPhone 13 pro max
"Great app but. I think we should have unlimited likes because after a while I cant like any more videos, and now Im trying to text with an old friend and it says put phone number in and I do so and it says this number is already used And its taking down my private videos"
Worthless. Bad app tik tok is secretly using our camera to spy on us  immediately delete tik tok
Noice. JUST NOICE but i dont like the fact the person who made tiktok is getting are data like the f-
"Worst app. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEY considered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
"It uses data, which aint cheap first of all. It uses my data and its annoying fix this"
"Great app. Really like this app, have soo much fun in watching funny and crazy stuff. Also soo many information we can get. Love it"
"very bad glitches/issues. i love tiktok im on it in the mornings, before bed, all day long and ive have it since like 2018. But since all these new users have joined and tiktok grew, theres been so many problems with it. Obviously the whole thing about it being shut down, but thats not the problem. This has happened times before but also today. I was scrolling through tiktok like usual and realised all the videos i saw had no comments, i was like ugh not this again. So i refreshed the app and it still did it and after the next few minutes it got worse. These are the problems: my account says i have no user, no likes, no followers and that im not following anyone. All the videos on my fyp had no profile pictures, no likes, no comments and no user. It kept saying i had no internet connection when every other app on my phone worked fine and i had 3 bars of wifi. The videos also kept stopping and starting and had no sound. Now this may be the fact im running out of phone storage, or i have an old phone. But i asked friends on the working apps and 4 others are having the same problem. So ive now given up and deleted it and hopi g it will soon be fixed so i can log back in. And also may you g kids are seeing things they shouldnt be, theres a lot of racism, homophobia, islamophobia, sexism etc. if your kid is young i do not recommend this app. Tiktok is also prone to a lot of apps being hacked. Hoping these issues get sorted out or i will not be downloading it again"
"Needs to have a privacy setting. My daughter has been begging me for tik tok and its been a while. Her brother always know best so I asked him if their was a setting that let you only have good content and no the dirty videos. He said that there was only warnings on the explicit content, and of course I knew that a warning signs wouldnt be enough to stop my daughter from see the explicit content. Please take this in mind and make a setting that will block all dirty and explicit videos. Thank you"
HORRIBLE. THIS APP IS TRASH ITS MAKING ME LOG IN AND I CANT GET OUT. IT STEALS YOUR INFORMATION AND ITS A HUGE DOWNFALL OF VINE AND MUSICALLY :( it&#39;s horrible okay? now i have some amazing gibberish for you; wiiwiwwiwiwiwisismsmjwwisiwjjssjskowowowowowowoowowowksmdmsnwnsjsjsjeiirejsjjdeiieeieijsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsksksisosososksjxjsjssiisisisieieieieisisieieieieiwiwiieiiuuuuwiwisisjsjiqowoeieiISIWOWOSIDKSJSIWIOWWOOWOWOowowosksmjeiww 
Tik tok is a Chinese company Chinese government bad. China steals your data if you use this app which is bad and China is committing genocide against the  uyghur Muslims which is very bad
Do not trust. You will be spied on
-. I did like TikTok but now Im not allowed on it because the app isnt of funny videos anymore but weird personal ones and everything 
Addictive. This so addictive and it consumes data a lot
"TikTok. Downloaded app it gets you addicted and theres are life hacks,dances other more"
Great App. I think Tiktok is an Incredible Platform

Delete dont download. Data farming is a big risk
Use my data for CCP facial recognition daddy. Title
Banned for no reason. Im 13 and got banned from tik tok unacceptable all my data is now gone I dont know why I got banned but I follow ur guidelines and get banned for being under ageridiculous I want this sorted ASAP
"disgusting. This app is so popular among teenagers that no matter how many reviews you write it wont do anything, this app is addicting, but not in a good way, it used to be funny when it started but now everyone just fights on it and people offend others. The algorithm is so bad that people who are suffering and trying to reach out and spread awareness, dont get any attention, but somebody lip-syncing can get millions of likes. This app is also always tracking you and listening to everything you say at home, like many other social media apps"
Ew. What dont people understand this is a spy app
Excellent. Tiktok is a incredible app. Wow its Really very good and awesome I like it. Thank you so much
update ruined the app. they got rid of all sports related stuff its still addicting tho
All about ticktock. Ticktock gives you lots of info and very protective about if your ment to be on this app or not its just amazing to watch I absolutely love this and just sit on my phone watching it for hours time flys buy x
Its ok. Its a really good app but it crunches  through my data
Good. Good but privacy isnt great
"not bad, i like. great app, would give it 5/5 only if the chinese didnt steal all my data, other than that though, love it"
Tic tok. Best app to go on it makes your day post videos for people to watch and for you to watch other peoples if you dont want people to watch your videos its your choice you can make them private for just you or you can do it friends only for your followers or public for everyone to see as I say its up to you and your parents
Amazing. It is a grate App its just dont turn on post notifications because it can get very messy and they text you every hour because if you follow someone Itll be like  hey so-and-so just posted a new video hey join the tick-tock trend so just dont turn on post notifications for ur own benefit and its a great app with so many thing I love it
I hate it. We love communist collecting our data 
Haram Garbage pedo China app. Time wasting pile of garbage China those scum collect ur data
"10/10 everyone get the app. This app is amazing and it is a fun experience to see unique qualities of people, share stories, lose track of time and more I will recommend this app to everyone who is considering getting tikok, really"
"Entertaining, best app on my phone. I love TikTok as its very entertaining and I can watch it for hours on end I love how it works and that you can easily make your own content as well as watching others. Its a positive and safe app and I definitely recommend it"
Fucking Chinese spy app. Spying on people around the world uninstall this app
Tick tock. Really good app but can you make it so it dosent come off WiFi or mobile data
Love it No1 App. Good information
TikTok. I think you should let TikTokers like as many videos and not stop us and Also Im loving this app its incredible 
I hate this app. I do not recommend this app its awful and sells information to other people YouTube is a great substitute for it
Why. It says enter your email or phone BUT WHEN I USE MY EMAIL IT SAYS ITS TAKEN??? ITS EITHER SOMEONE HACKED MY EMAIL OR TIKTOK JUST FULL ON SUCKS
"No name ?. I like the app but the only thing is that I dont like that you need to have a certain amount of followers for you to go live. I also think that it would be better if you dont need data or Wi-Fi to use the app because what if your having problems with your Wi-Fi and you run out of data what do you do and what if the problem youre having with the Wi-Fi cant get fixed until the end of the month and you get your data at the end of the month. That means youll be waiting a whole entire month for you to watch one video. Which is kind of a bummer, but other than that I love it"
Bad. Its wastes so much data and is too addicting and you never get on the fyp
"Keep Tik Tok. Tik Tok has been the best form of communication and insight into the lives of regular  people, not celebrities. I have cried hard, laughed hard, and loved hard seeing the talented, real, diverse society. There are grandsons dancing with and spending g time with their grandmothers putting smiles on their faces, there are siblings doing incredible things together. There is fun and creativity everyday posted by someone you wish were your best friend or next door neighbor. Tik Tok is where you find words of encouragement, a laugh when you need it and an opportunity to communicate and align with stranger on LIVE or through comments. Please please keep this medium. It has literally been a lifesaver for most of us. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT If the Chinese want my information they can have it Just keep Tok Tok LOL"
TIKTOK IS THE BEST. There is no reason on earth why tiktok should not exist and personally I wouldnt be able to live without it And I think it deserves more than 5 stars And if you havent downloaded tiktok yet go do it It will be the best decision of your life And the app is free And you can get verified and become famous And if you get a lot of likes on the app you will be famous all over the world Its absolutely incredible I have always wanted to be verified but its okay because Im still trying my best and I hope that one day I can be verified
Great job. I think you should make tik tok a game to play But dont make us use our data But other then that you have done a great job
"Its Addictive. I literally watch TikTok FOR HOURS I love it and I think its such an incredible platform when used responsibly Also, its just a lot of fun"
Pure addiction. Warning dont get one if you want a normal life.  It takes hours out of your life.  Nor if you value your privacy
Entertaining. All of One star are people who just refuse to download this app I used to be one of those people and nowI love TikTok
Entertaining. All of One star are people who just refuse to download this app I used to be one of those people and  nowI love TikTok
I love TikTok. I really like Tik Tok but sometimes it doesnt work but Im on cellular data
Tik Tok is a spy app. Tik Tok is not a safe app you should delete it immediately
OMG. I absolutely love TikTok but Ive been hearing rumours about how people spy on you and I dont know if its true or not but other than that Tiktok is amazing
Creepy. Chinese people spying on you with this app I recommend dont get it
Incredible App with Vast Community. For years my husband told me to stop getting angry and biting my hand (its an Italian thing) when I read Twitter and to post my thoughts on TikTok. I thought I was too old for it. But so many people from all walks of life use TikTok. Its kind of astounding. Im so happy with the community Im attracting and the amount of excitement were generating
Great App. Great app for reduce adds and sometimes it takes plenty GB of my Data Pack 
Tik tok is a really good app thumbs up . I love tik tok  So much because I learn dances and hacks . I share the app with my friends at school and its just for fun but Im learning more I love tik tok so much its the best app Ive played on and I have over 4320 likes WOW  Its not about the followers and likes its about having fun Im not bothered if Im not viral Im only 10 so my account is private and I should not show my identity I hope you guys enjoyed my review thank you tik tok aswell its a really entertaining app to play on
"different phone number and email address. i really like tiktok but there is one thing that is on my nerves. when i first created my account i had a different phone and email number than i do now. when i try and change my phone number and email address i need a verification code which i obviously cant confirm. i also try and change my password but i need a verification code for that aswell. if i get hacked i wouldnt be able to change my password. i have made a backup account with my actual phone number and email address just in case, though i dont want to make that my main account. if there is anything you can do about this please reply"
So thankful for this app. I am using this app to help me with my small business and connect with similar entrepreneurs .wow.. I love it so much. It is super helpful for boosting my marketing strategies and my confidence. It is also amazing to see so many other incredible people doing really fun and exciting things out there.

Ehehehehheehheehu. Hi I downloaded tik tok but then I deleted it down it says when I try downloading it agin it has something about billing info plz help 
"This is the best app. This has funny videos life hacks and anything else you can imagine.It is soooo good with filters and voice changers for when you do a slideshow or a normal video.Which  you can ether lip sing to or make your own.You can like videos and follow people, you can go public like I am or go private or only let your friends see and you will still get followers and likes.You can also get famous from an app like this.Now Charli Dmelio is the most famous person on tik tok with 16.2 Million followers and now she is famous because of this app"
The BEST APP EvEr. I truly love this app it has changed people lives for better thank you creators of TikTok and please keep improving this incredible App
feedback. i just wish it didnt take up so much data
This is awesome. ticktock is practically part of my family. i watch it almost every day it helps me understand whats going on in the world and life hacks i can use when im older. you can use so many fun effects and filters to laugh at yourself and to post. tiktok is on my screen time at a high percentage i live tiktok some much thank you God
"Excellent. Tiktok is a incredible app. I like so much,, very good"
Recommend for year 10+. Honestly this app is incredible I couldnt live without it Its so good but the only tony down side is some of the content but thats just depending on what posts you like and dont like Hate aswell is another thing but its just people being stupid so you just need to be careful on what and when you post on this app but Id still give it a five star because its just so addicting and fun to watch other peoples content and its just the best and I honestly couldnt live without Tiktok
Change in life. Im happier and do not want to watch TV anymore. I get so excited and look forward to have the free time to watch videos. It makes me laugh. I need a lot of data tho. I dont get many views not sure why
Fix your app. I cant watch any of my private tiktoks because it just says failed to load on all of them. Its been like this for two days
And ye. I like the app but I hate the privacy thing and I dont know how to turn it off so my acc is boring
Ugh. I liked tiktok so much but all of a sudden it wouldnt open the app so I deleted it and reinstalled it and then it still wouldnt open the app so I turned my phone off and back on. Then eventually the app opened my account was of course logged out but it wont log me back onto my account it logs me into my other accounts tho? I want it to be normal its so annoying Im scared incase I was hacked
TikTok is awesome. I love TikTok but you can get a lot of hate on it lots of people can be a bit mean and you are sharing a lot of personal things like for example where you live but it is also really fun you make videos learn dances it is the best app I have and I am on it 24/7 You can follow people like their videos comment and do so many other amazing incredible fun things
"My review. I love this app its incredible, plus there is a growing community of Christian TikTok creators"
App only works over wifi but not mobile data. Hi Generally like the concept of the app and the fact you can grow quickly on it.However the app is glitchy on my phone and doesnt work at all over mobile data 5G. Only wifi I hitch is annoying because I dont have wifi and when I do it can be slow at home

Tick-tock. A lot of people are saying that its an uptick that you need Wi-Fi to watch a TikTok while youre watching peoples videos like on YouTube do you need Wi-Fi to watch if you dont have data yeah you do TickTock is kind of like YouTube except better
"Tik Tok violated my private video. Ok so I was scrolling down my private videos from years ago and I saw that one of my Tik Toks was taken down. But it was a private post my followers can not see it, only I can. They violated my personal video for no reason. I checked the audio and it was fine so I dont get why they took the tik tok down, because only I can see it and I did nothing inappropriate. Not cool tik tok "
Goodbye TikTok. You always were terrible and YOU SOLD CHILDRENS  DATA OINK OINK YOU CAPITALIST PIG
"TikTok is amazing. I love how you can watch other peoples TikToks and you can do your own. You can comment ,like and follow not literally follow but if you follow someone on TikTok you can get notifications and watch it."
"DO NOT USE. China is controlling people data on here, I dont use Tik tok for this reason. America is their main target If your in America or anywhere do not use. This is there way of taking over peoples mind"
"TikTok Is Incredible. I love the amount of creativity on this app. You can stay safe while watching and creating content I highly recommend this app- especially if youre bored, TikTok has the cure Five stars"
"My account went missing or blocked for no reason. I used to have an account on this app and I posted videos like any normal TikToker , but for some reason the app just turned all black and I wasnt able to access anything. When I re downloaded the app, it says my account was unable to authorize, but I never ever did anything wrong to get blocked or to get hacked. This really confuses me and I would really appreciate if theres an answer of why this had happened. If you are able to, please reply"
"Incredible. This app is the best thing to ever happen to me  and the worst though. Warning, if you download your screen time will significantly go up"
"I want to know why it logged me off my other account. Tiktok is great and all but,I was out and I switched my account and it didnt work so I I took tiktok off my tabs and then I forgot about it since I was nearly home (btw I done this with my mobile data on) and I get home and I go switch my account when I realise my account that finally reached 200 followers wasnt there , I tried everything But nothing worked , Im disappointed with this incident , please explain why this happened. (The account was puppy_queen2802) so please check that out"
". Hey guys,       First of all just would like to say I LOVE YOUR APP Second of all the community seems to be incredible thus far.  Thirdly would just like to congratulate you on your overall success as a platform. Top notch to say the platformsincerely PikaBros6ix"
Tic Tock first time user I like it so far. Many different people and some information that I can use
Safe For Families. Setting privacy preferences allows for greater control over viewing Contant. Parent can restrict and or eliminate videos they find it objectionable
Amazing. I have got to be Tiktok Famous now thanks to this amazing app Incredible
Absolutely amazing. Honestly TikTok is a great app it saves me from boredom all day but the only problems are that you have to have 2000 followers to live stream and I think thats a bit much  but other than that its absolutely incredible and I fully request it  X
So thankful for this app. I am using this app to help me with my small business and connect with similar entrepreneurs .wow.. I love it so much. It is super helpful for boosting my marketing strategies and my confidence. It is also amazing to see so many other incredible people doing really fun and exciting things out there. My sales have increased and I can see myself accomplishing my goals thanks to using this app. Thank you Tik Tok 
Why u should download TikTok. You get to meet incredible people you got to do for activities and theres like different dances in different themes every like few days and months and theres different trends and its really good and you get to live saying and share your feelings with the world
Addictive . This app is so amazing I spend mostly everyday on it.be careful of people who u dont know because there a few men out there and keep ur account on private. I love this app 
I would totaaaalllly rate this a five but. People say u guys added a green dote so people say they spy on u and ya I dont have this app anymore bc of this cause
Its awesome app I had ever really I love TikTok. You can know Anything about Anything in a few seconds Its incredible app Tik Tok I full in love with.
Removal of chats. Why did they remove chats for people under 16?They are a national security and steal your information. You should be less worried about the CIA and more so about this app
Fraud. Chinese trucking and private information theft
"my personal review :). I really like tik tok and it is a very fun environment to be in although there are some ups and downs about it. I have tried several times to reach tik tok through their Instagram account and through their email, it has not been answered so I kindly just ask if you can take time out of your day to answer some of our requests, please and thankyou. Although back to the actual review, it is an amazing app where I feel comfortable knowing that there are other teens out there struggling with the same problem. It is an environment where I feel secure and safe although Id just like to kindly ask if you can put more inspiring videos like that on the fyp. Overall it is an amazing app and I definitely dont regret downloading it"
I hate tik tok. They track your ip do not download TickTock thats a warning they can catch your IP
"Its fine. Its fine . Works as expected .. BUT Would be better if you let people specifically tell you why they reported an Acct .. I dont care if their user name is similar to mine .. really .. .. BUT WHAT IS infuriating  that they screen grabbed my face and you wont force them to take down the stolen picture of ME, that theyre using on their attempted cloned acct of me"
No. Try not to steal our data
Terrible. Basically to be able to use it you have to put your email in and theyre using it to spy on people if youre really gonna put your email in theyre gonna spy on you so dont make videos on there my friend found out of course I didnt but I think its necessary to tell you please tell as many people as you can thank you to Who ever reads this whole thing have a good night/Day
"Tik tok bad. This is the absolute worse app ever made, the only purpose it serves is spy aware and for creeps to look at younger people during quarantine"
Fun data stealing. Stealing are data but its fun
"Really good But there is a problem. I have had this app since 2018 and have loved it so much It is such a good app to have and is a MUST. The only thing is, I have an aesthetic account (really trendy satisfying videos) on TikTok and I have just hit 1000 followers But, I was really excited to go live and they wont let me. Please sort this out tiktok. But otherwise... INCREDIBLE"
LOVE THIS APP . Im on it pretty much 24/7 and its because its such an addictive app. The filters are weird but funny. Everyone on there is really nice and literally my fav app I try my best to keep up with all the trends  does use up a lot of data and battery especially for iPhone. Other then that the best app. Love it so much xx
CANT DOWNLOAD. Im saying it Bc my billing info is stuck and I cant get it on my ipad
ITS ANNOYING. THIS NEW UPDATE IS SO FRIGGIN ANNOYING I HATE RE WATCHING MY VIDEOS AND SEEING THEM JUST FLOT ON THE CORNER OF MY SCREEN PLEASE GET RID OF THIS OR I WILL DELETE IT AND WHEN I TRY TO DELETE AN ACCOUNT YOU ALWAYS SAY we hate to be seeing you go whats the reason? AND YALL ALWAYS CONFINCE ME TO STAY damn that got a little personal. BUT STILL PLEASE GET RID OF IT
"Waste my time all day. Im on it too much a day because its addicting, I dont even care that over there in China theyre stealing our information"
"What u rate it?. This app is so fun, the amount of effort and time out to make this app is incredible, I love playing games and making tik toks with my buddies Its astonishing, and I absolutely love it.*_ the only down part is that my account got deleted cause I accidentally pressed it, but its not youre fault neither the creators,Love the app, keep updating and keep working , Im sure youll be the best app in town &lt;3"
"Best App Ever. This app is amazing Its a place where positivity reigns. Its a place where people come together to laugh, share personal stories and support each other. The rules are simple and this platform is the best so far. I recommend it to everyone. Ive even become addicted to it because it just makes me so happy Thank you TIKTOK Xxxxx"
AMAZING. I gave tik tok 4 stars because it is amazing BUT quite unfair. I am part of the cosplay community on tiktok and we are reported for the most random reasons like wearing a crop top with short shorts while the normals are allowed to wear the smallest bikinis without even a warning That kind of disappointed me but other than that it is amazing. For parents you can put ur child of privacy mode and they wont be able to interact with strangers so no need to be uncomfortable  definitely recommend this app
"Ah yes. A way to sell all of ur personal info to China, this app is garbage tho, Is litteraly destroying the youth, Allows racism, ruins songs, teaches weird hand movement, this app sux"
Its amazing. 10000900000000009/0000000000 but I did hear it was I Chinese spying app
Excellent. Tiktok is a incredible app. Wow its Really very good and I like it Thank you so much
DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Made by China and they use it to spy on you. Utter bolloks
"Tik Tok sucks. It steals childrens data, promotes dangerous challenges, awful company and everything is bad"
"China . Ok I been in TikTok since 2018 until in Australia, its going to be bannedChina and the government is stealing ur info and taking ur privacy, like WTF, we all have privacy but its China, theyre stealing ur info and data and having access to ur phone, question: is musical.ly from America? I gotta say, as an Australian, I think banning and not banning r the biggest decisions to me, but I think both, I enjoyed memories until something wrong, China is pretty much spying, like WTF is wrong with u? I know tiktok is Chinese but we need another app which is NOT from China-sup"
This app can have bad outcomes. Tiktoks fanbase is manly pointet toward kids and teens but some vidios can show 18+ content just think of the kids faces when they see that stuff and also some vidios supports terrorisom and please do something or I will take it into my own hands and also has made people annoyed and this app can support bullying and sexism and racism and also there are meny roumers about this being a spy app please dont install this app also can get children introble at school please fix this immediately or I will take this into my own hands
"INCREDIBLE. TikTok is amazing, I absolutely love it And all the people on there are so wonderful with all there dances they make up Its so fun to do with your friends when u can duet each other and make joint accounts I definitely think you should get the app Love you TikTok"
Devil in Disquise. This app is hijacking the minds of young and mentally vulnerable. it is highly addictive and horribly detrimental to those who use it. not to mention the lack of civil discourse. the content borders on traumatizing and indoctrinating. AND ALL OF YOUR DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. 0/10 would highly recommended parents do not allow their children to use this app and educate them on the dangers of social medias like it
Funny entertainment. Just love this app/ tiktok community for information and for fun. TY
. I love it its a great way to make new friends but I suggest putting your account on private so you can decide who watches your videos
Tic tic. Tik tok  has helped me through lots of thing thats why Ive gave my 5 stars however u do need to be careful as this app has broken my sisters phone we dont know how but China Is getting all your pics of your phone and personal information there for be careful
I HATE TIK TOK. Tiktok banned me for doing nothing theay said I broke the guide lines when I did not tik tok stop hiring bots and start f ing haveing repsect AND STOP SCAMMING AND STEALING ARE PRIVATE INFO OR UR GONNA BE POOR SOME DAY UR GONNA END UP LIKE VINE ULL DIE
"Terrible app. Some of the things on the app are cool, theres good memes and cool dances but the Chinese use it to farm data and spy on people so Id advise against using this"
"Bad. App is extremely addictive and does not help with mental health. also it  takes up a ton of storage and kills your phone battery videos are kind of lame, and somehow the app knows what shows you watch and more personal stuff"
"My review on tiktok. Tiktok is an amazing app where you can be yourself, post videos doing pretty much what ever inspires or makes you happy and overall its an incredible app that I definitely recommend to anyone"
Excellent. Tiktok is a incredible app. Its Really very good and I like it Thank you so much
"Greatest app out there. Just use it for what it was intended for. Funny, creative and original videos. We dont care your not an addict anymore, we dont care about your personal problems"
LOOOK AT THIS NOW. TIK TOK IS TAKING UR INFO GET RID OF NOWWWWW HURRY
My personal review. I think tiktok is a great app There is learning features and tells you about Covid-19 and how to stay safe. The camera quality is fine but it would be nicer if you could choose how long the sounds can be. Because with some sounds I want to use but they are only like 8 seconds long. But thats not a real problem. I wish you didnt have to wait a MONTH to change your username. Maybe every two weeks but each month Sometimes people put mistakes in there usernames and then have to wait a month. Thats one of my main complaints. But apart from Its a brilliant app. I definitely give it 5 stars
Excellent. Tiktok is a incredible app. Really I like it Thank you so much
Really good. Its very safe and my favourite thing about it is you get a notification if someone hacks you so you can change you password really quickly
"Awful people but also highly addictive. The whole issue of this app has nothing to do with the app itself but it has everything with the users on it. This app shows just how horrible and evil the human race is, say anything 1 person finds offensive and the mob will try to destroy you. Greg Doucette is an example all he did was make a response video only saying that she could of been nicer about rejecting the guy instead of making a TikTok video about it and the angry mob cancels him on the app. Constant videos of women height shaming men something people cannot control, absolute sexism by people who claim that they\'re not sexist. I would not bother with this app also I do not like the fact that you cannot see the time, that is not okay to do as you lose track of time and being able to scroll through so many videos and have no idea what the time is, imo should get this app age restricted, you can waste so much time on the app. The problems are 2, 1 the awful userbase this has to do with bad people breeding with bad people and the environment and culture being bad so 99% of their offspring become bad people and 2 the fact you cannot keep track of time and that is the only thing that they\'ve designed which is not acceptable, the App Store should not even allow this app to be downloaded by under 18 year olds for that reason alone. This app is incredibly addictive, it\'s going to act like a drug, this app scan easily ruin your sleep schedule and cause problems in your life, best not to download this app"
Great. It is a good app for older kids as they can watch many different people and things in it. Make sure if your kids young you have a privacy setting on so only people they allow can view there account. This helps inspire people Overall I think its an amazing app
"Spy App, tons of fun tho. yep it's a spy app. Problem is if someone in your house has it you are all being spied on already. Apartment complex? Yep you are being spied on. Might as well have fun with it. It's a TON of fun So dive on in you will love it"
Worst app ever. Killed the battery on my last phone. Also when I download the app I get flooded with spam phone calls. I delete the app and I dont get them anymore. TikTok bad
"Amazing Experience. TikTok is such an incredible app Its so easy to use, you get to be your authentic self and connect with so many people all over the world Its features take mobile video editing to the next level If your looking for an easy way express yourself to the world and have fun doing it? TIKTOK is for YOU"
"not a fan of the new update. i love tiktok and its a good app, however the newest update is awful, whenever i click to watch videos pop ups of comments and likes appear on the screen, which means i cant actually watch the video. also i understand that the company needs to bring younger viewers privacy but on a 16 year olds public account where they post edits doesnt mean that they should block people from commenting, due to privacy. not only are my videos flopping, people cant comment on them.hopefully you can change this?thanks"
App is incredible. I love keeping up with my friends and posting videos Theres so many possibilities with this app Great way to pass time and slow life down for a bit
"I hate it. TIKTOK IS TRACKING US its acc so annoying, I was talking abt Tom cruise and I get tiktoks abt him, like I beg u tiktok stop being such a creep"
Bruh. I know your spying on me
"Fake news. This website is good, but the most people are using fake information about everything, that is giving them opportunities to put false accusations or information to against others. This is illegal and unlawful manner to attackPeople or agents or government or university..etc"
Tiktok. Great app recording and watching videos on here is so fun and cool music and sounds are great love the privacy settings and its family friendly lots of fun in my opinion 5 stars 100%
"this app is horrible. tiktok used to be amazing, incredible and everything good but they updated it so now YOU CANT COPY COMMENTS? tiktok fix this right now"
"What happened???. I updated my app and now I cant use any of the special features such as filters, stickers, effects. The app just says Im not connected to the internet. Ive cleared my cache, reinstalled, check my mobile data, turned phone off and back on. Went to YouTube, tik tok to ask questions NOTHING Im not happy about this at all"
"I Love TikTok. Keeps me off of Facebook Also, so many recipes and life hacks that I enjoy watching"
"Chinese spyware app. Racist, fat phobic ect. Chinese spy ware app dont trust it delete"
Great app tho too many racists. Karens who say its spying with conspiracies okay thats cool  but dont be rude and stop using the app then
Great info. I love it and great information
"BLM. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEY considered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
"SEXIST RACIST SPYWARE. This app can track you and spy on you PARENT IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD HAT TIK TOK IT IS INNAPROPIATE my 8 year old cousin has and she is much more rude,violent and inappropriate yes even if you are over 18 you still shouldnt download tik tok it will just be very cringe and disgusting So DONT DOWNLOAD TIK TOK"
"Okay, but too much censorship bias. A Chinese company would never steal users info and censor things they dont agree with"
Dont download it. Tik tok is a spying app made by the Chinese the government is banning it in different countries because the Chinese made it. Apparently there was a 9 year old girl doing a dance and found out the was over 150 men watching her do it. DELETE IT NOW IM WARNING YOU
;-;. (Please read) Ok so yes it is what the app says it is but there can be some racism in this app and there is some inappropriate things being posted in the app and also uhm this app can track you... but I will tell you one more time THE APP IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT IS so no faults advertising and I mean yes it is a fun app as well so this is the good and the bad about it (thank you)
"Repost button. Hey Tiktok you added the repost button a little while ago and I still seem to not have it, My Tiktok is all update to date and so it my phone. I keep going to settings and checking privacy to see if the repost button is there but its not, please let me know how to get it because I had it before and I turned it off and the next day it was gone. Please help me Tiktok or anyone else. I have a iPhone 11 btw"
Spam data stealing. Spam data stealing
It is good. Tick tock is good because you can make videos and post it to your friends or you can make it privacy so all you can watch it and I dont make my videos Private I show it to my friends even if I dont get comments but I enjoy it and Im not telling a Lie I only make 16 videos Im going to make more and if you are a kid and you think youre the only one no youre not theres lots of people younger people and all the people Im just a child Im 11 years old and I make videos on TikTok and I like it so if I was you I prefer to download this
TikTok. This app is INCREDIBLE I absolutely love it. It has cured my boredom in lock down and is just so fun I really recommend this app Literally its amazing
Wouldnt recommend it unless you want ti make a YouTube video. This app ruined my mental health and so I would recommend not to use this app unless you have a channel or website where you host your own videos then I see why not. Just be careful what data you put on TikTok
TikTok. TikTok is great I make gaming content but I cannot add a link to my bio so Im boutta just delete it and move on to something else I have tried to do personal and business account but no link can be placed
Not too good. There are Chinese people spying on me
Its ok. I like this app very much but there is some stuff on there that is racist and people say like get me famous or else my teacher wont like me but this app is very fun to use. But now there are SO many toxic people on there exposing there self and friends private things at family. But I do find this app fun but there are so many toxic people that I saw trying to track peoples locations and so much worse things but I do rlly like this app
"TikTok is an incredible app. TIK TOK is an incredible app, there is no adverts.entertaining videos that Appel to what you like. Getting popular is very easy You can link your instagram, and Facebook to it so you can get more likes and views for that. My account is @mia.snow123 please go follow"
Best app everbut be safe. This app is so amazingeverytime Im bored this app makes me wanna be creativeand theres some amazing food trendsbut be safe while your on this appdont post any of your private information and no inappropriate stuffbut other than that have fun:)
Because youre spying on us. Its in the news
Tiktok is not letting me log into my account. My old phone number is associated with my account which I dont have access to and now I cant reset it to a new number also when Im using my email to rest it its not letting me reset it this is a very bad app and poor customer service no help from them
OMG. Its an amazing app I use it everyday but if you dont have mobile data or WiFi then you cant use it  Once you use it your addicted I have even got the older people in my family involved 10/10  
Phenomenal. I enjoy this app as it provides great information and an opportunity for many to see
Entertaining and Educational. I enjoy TikTok for the entertainment and the information I have learned about UNTOLD history
I have no idea whats wrong. TikTok wont let me log in I have WiFi and data but it says sorry please connect to the internet. I need helppppp 
LOVE THIS APP. sometimes I lose track of time cos Im always on this app
"My accounts are not working. hey tiktok my accounts have not been working latley its been logging me out then when i tried to come back on its asking for my camera and microphone access and when i try too do it,it will not pop up on the screen for it too work so please can u help my account its making me angry and i love tiktok but as this is happening i have too put a 4 i hope i can change it too a 5 soon"
BLACK LIVES MATTER. DO NOT GET THIS APP. they try covering up there tracks. YOU KNOW YOU ARE RACIST THE APP IS ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE ALLOWING THEM TO USE A BUG PLATFORM TO SPREAD HATE AND YOU DONT EVEN TAKE THE VIDEO DONE FIX UP. #blacklivesmatter
"Love it. Takes up all the time that Id normally use to overthink and have panic attacks, if you havent downloaded it yet, what are you doing with your life? If youre re-downloading this on a new phone or just reading the comments, Hey bestie Looking beautiful today K bye :) <3"
Chinese spyware. Spying on us
"Love it. Its an awesome app we all use TikTok at my place, yeah my boys mostly for their games but the features are incredible and free and on the plus side if you follow the right people, you get some wonderful ideas. Its good for entertainment too TikTok over fb  Would be good to know who shared and viewed the videos though. Thank you"
China are spying on us. Beware China released TikTok a few years ago to spy on the Australian Government. This app can be very lethal towards many across the globe. ABC News states this a few days ago. Beware
"TikTok Rocks. I know a lot of young people use TikTok, and as my daughter has said, its not really meant for older people even though Im not that old. I think that it has continent that is just about for every age group. Also I like that I can use it for business purposes There are so many editions options that are fairly easy to use and I like the whole concept of anyone and everyone getting to upload videos with such a wide variety of content, and use them for personal use or for business use"
This app can have bad outcomes. Tiktoks fanbase is manly pointet toward kids and teens but some vidios can show 18+ content just think of the kids faces when they see that stuff and also some vidios supports terrorisom and please do something or I will take it into my own hands and also has made people annoyed and this app can support bullying and sexism and racism and also there are meny roumers about this being a spy app please dont install this app also can get children introble at school please fix this immediately or I will take this into my own hands the public need to hear this and if you dont believe me look it up
Tom. TikTok is my personal favourite app I use it all the time
So gudddd. So good I use all my data :(
WARNING. China government is spying on us who has tik Tok they can even go through your private stuff and its inappropriate for kids and also its racist I saw some killing animals videos
"Such An Addicting App. Yes I know addictive apps can be good and bad but I tell you this in a good way, tiktok is such a great way to share communicate and connect with others and people who are in different countries as you, if you dont like tiktok honestly that is your personal opinion but for me tiktok helps you to learn more things, giving you amazing tips you didnt know you needed and give your information about the latest topic happening in society"
"Tiktok. It might have cussing but it sure is relaxing, and funny, you also get to see small dances, and famous people you might know. you can become famous by just making 1-2 15 second videos a day. Ask someone from personal experience like Charli DAmelio she has over 120 million followers, she is the person who has the most followers on Tiktok. She became popular by doing a 15 second dance. You could also make money if you have over 2 million followers.For example Charli dAmelio makes over 4 million dollars a year. I would recommend this app for ages 12 and up. Even parents could like it. So go download it now, what are you waiting for"
Bussin. I don't know what to but it's nice but tracking and inappropriate
"Needs to be fixed. I dont understand why drafts cant be saved on the account and not the phone I had so many Videos saved in the drafts to post but I cant now because I had to switch phones a lot were transitioning videos Ive had this issue ever since I started tiktok if you wanna see my @ then its @yeahimdonnie but people put alot of thought in their drafts and accidents happen and no longer able to access them which is a big flag no me as a person cant do anything but I hope this as a comment will reach yall that drafts should be saved under the account and not the phone please fixed (Ive had drafts through two generations of phones but cant access because theyre gone once I apply a new phone and its a shame taking, if you want to make tools or able for creators to make something change it to be able to save though accounts not devices if anything up your safety issues I should not have to start a video that took so much effort just for it to be deleted once something happened in my personal surroundings to the device Im on once deleted I feel like its not worth putting the time in when you have time vs not having time please tiktok fix this issue from what I have heard Im not the only one with this issue)"
Bad. App is extremely addictive and does not help with mental health it also takes up a ton of storage and kills you phone battery videos are kind of lame and somehow the app knows what shows you watch and more personal stuff
"I love tiktok. When i found tiktok at first it wasnt my favourite but then suddenly i figured the point and i am addicted it is my life and i am so gratefull for it because u can watch videos , like ,comment ,follow and make 5 to 60 second videos ever with the picture layouts they give you or by dancing , lip syncing , talking  or dueting and reacting to videos however if u dont want people to duet or react to ur videos u can turn it off also u can have a private or public account and with ur videos u can choose whever u want public to see it or freinds or just u there is also a for you account where u can see public videos"
"Amazing. I made some amazing friends and met many wonderful people Although the controls are very hard for editing profile. TikTok should probably update the profile editing to add; age and pronouns, in order to make it easier to keep in track with users"
I dont like Tim tok. Tink tok has not only been videos of young girls my age and older up to 15 show most of thier skin... but it has also made quite a few suicidle videos that give people nightmares. I also found out that even if you have a private account the Chinese government or who ever owns it at the time can look into it. This has scared of many people. I quit TikTok 10 months ago and I do not regret it My friend has it and says that someone hacked thier account and deleted all her videos. She made a new one but is now very scared... I hope you take my advice and quit TikTok but if you dont thats ok I wouldnt recommend buying it
TikTok Creator. Love this app. I recommend downloading the app and watching videos. It is so much fun
Amazing. Tiktok is amazing it has entertainment its so fun and funny you get to make new friends and learn new hacks and then important stuff and its such a good app and I go get it  amazing you cant be famous and its really fun incredible :)
SO Fun. Tiktok is a great app because you can do DIYs and dances and hacks and lots more it is an overall amazing app to just express yourself . So you should 100% download it
Gay. You scumbags steal data
The best social discovery app. Tick-tock is a better social discovery app than anything Ive ever used before. Its allowed me to gain incredible reach in a short amount of time and share my contact with people that actually want to see it
"Good, but please fix this. Every time i make an account, it lasts 2 days before getting permanently banned, or i get logged out, and cant log back in. Please fix this, i lost all my followers and data"
Best. Best app out there. Pure entertainment and information. Addictive to say the least 
Concern netizen. Why always lag even they are stable Internet And To much stealing Data
"TIK TOK IS DANGEROUS. Tik tok has been caught spying on millions of IPhone users so If you own anything from apple, or even any device company. Tik tok is spying on tik tok users, so for youre saftey delete this app. it was made in China which is not the best country to trust. Tik tok make this app more safe please"
"Review. This app is incredible, I love it I truly do "
"Awesome. Do you want to lose track of time, get the app"
"Change. So like tiktok is good and all it helps me laugh and I love the fact that its a friendly community but one thing that should be changed is not being able to use the same email for multiple accounts, why let us make multiple accounts when we cant verify its us because we cant use our personal email"
Best app. Love the videos pls great privacy and everything so ya
"I love tik tok. Honestly,although it doesnt work without WiFi unless you have data,its very addicting,I have 40 something followers my tik tok account is sprinkle lover 2012 all joined up,I gave this app a five star rating,I hope this helped you,one more thing,#Dontbantiktok"
Remove. Remove this app as soon as possible people are hacking and stealing kids
"Good quality. This is an amazing app where everyone can post stuff and everyone can belong, I believe everyone can have fun and watch other peoples amazing and interesting content. Everyone should get this incredible app"
TikTok. It fun I like it easy to use but be aware of you p. Information as they might dig deeper than you think 
"Kinda scary. If you are on your For You Page for long enough, youll get warnings are insights of your near future. *personal experience*"
"Stupid app. Dont get, it spys on you and burn it. Do NOT get"
Its time waster. Spies on you
Its a cool app and it deserves 5 stars. I like it because it isnt irrelevant and you get to have a great time watching and making tiktoks
"TikTok. Love this app great for all ages and tons of humor that will get everyone laughing. Also this app has incredible facts on it for food, sports, school, pets and many more"
Offline. Go offline so people can use Snapchat without wifi or data you just need service
"I love TikTok. Its an amazing app, I never felt so entertained in my life, omg it is incredible, keep it up It is really really really good. Definitely recommend this app to ANYONE"
Its Addictive. I literally watch TikTok FOR HOURS I love it and I think its such an incredible platform
Taylor maxwell. Because it wont let me have a regular TickTock itll just say were going to re-launch the app so you can have your own personal TickTock and it wont let me have it on private account or follow people or anything like that
"Love TikTok. I have found more things, information that I can use, recipes that are fabulous, so much information on helpful things I cant even begin to say I love TikTok "
I read your terms and conditions . Thanks for spying on me China
. Tik Tok can look at all ur information on your phone and also look through ur camera when not turned on
Dont get it. Its owned by the chinese and they steal ur info
CHING CHANG CHONG. Chinas stealing your personal information like the disfigured commies they are
"Love this app and the community. Cant speak highly enough, this app is incredible both as a fun platform to just enjoy content but also as a place to discover new things, learn and grow and develop new skills and meet new communities of people, superb "
. they steal ur info do not install PERIOD
Tik Tok is very versatile. I love the information that comes through TikTok and the simple useableness of the site. Theres so much information and a variety of ways to learn new things Thank you for creating a platform that can give short inspirations

Dont download. Its Chinese spy ware thats all this app is
Ehehehehheehheehu. Hi I downloaded tik tok but then I deleted it down it says when I try downloading it agin it has something about billing info plz help  plz
"Best app Ever. Tik Tok is the most engaging, entertaining and informative app available. The app is easy to use for passive and enjoyable viewing. But, what makes this app so incredible is how easy it is to use to create and post your own content. I am tech novice and at 60 a first time social media user, and I am having a blast creating content for the first time ever With all the creative tools available on the app the creation possibilities are endless And, of course, the fun of connecting in a positive way with others is also a huge benefit. Just love this platform Keep it up, its great"
It is spyware. I need it to stop spying on me pls
AMAZING. I love TikTok it is so amazing I enjoy using the cute and funny filters and making videos But my parents made me delete it because apparently people are spying on us through tik tok
"my opinion. TikTok is an incredible app for creativity, i fully recommend this app to anyone The only flaw is that sometimes it can get very toxic. "
TIKTOK. Every night I get side tracked after 1 video and then just want to keep on watching because its so entertaining Over all LOVE the app
"How Tik Tok Changed My Life. Hi my TikTok name is @saraofray3. A year and a few months ago I joined TikTok . I was very camera shy then. This app has changed my life. Im 56 yrs old and not very popular on TikTok but I looks forward to doing a video almost everyday. I have met some incredible people and have so much fun with this app. Thank you so much it has made me feel at least 15 yrs younger. I do not always post incredible videos but Im always positive and try to make people smile or dance. I may not get many likes, comments, or shares but I am enjoying every minute . And I feel so fortunate to have met so many beautiful people from all over the world. Thank You Tik Tok  I LOVE TIKTOK "

"Great app. It is a great place to meet, support and share business information, creativity and help others"
TikTok. TikTok is a app that I watch and enjoy it makes me feel like Im free Im not in a world with hating or fighting

:). Fun and full of new information if used properly
Spy. Im getting spied on by the Chinese communist party
I love this app. Love this appmuch more personal & so easy to collaborate with people all over the world.
"Amazing. Tiktok is an amazing, hilarious app But if I had to say something to help you guys out it would be it probably needs to not swear as much because although the app is 12/13+ younger kids happen to join the app quite often But except from that...ITS INCREDIBLE"
"How Tik Tok Changed My Life. Hi my TikTok name is @saraofray3. A year and a few months ago I joined TikTok . I was very camera shy then. This app has changed my life.

. I really love the app you should get it but I would rather some people be careful when you make a video just to make sure no bad people will track you down:)
Its aight. It steals your information and sells it god knows where. Pretty fun tho ngl
Hacked. It&#39;s hacked I really like it but it&#39;s China is spying on you sadly but it&#39;s really good
Creeping up on 6.8M and Love tiktok bec you have the opportunity to rebrand. I get to express myself through short videos even after not posting for a while due to personal problems. I can always count on tiktok
"The Land of opportunities. I do like  TikTok. I have learnt a lot here. Honestly, there are all sorts of videos to satisfy every need, inquiry or taste. I have learnt how to use my I-phone more efficiently, I have laughed as I viewed funny videos, I have been inspired by faith based videos, I have prayed, I have affirmed, I have been challenged, I have received important information on business , the list goes on and on, TikTok is absolutely Amazing Come aboard and be a part of this educative and incredible community; youll be glad you did"
"Tiktok is 5 star. During my journey on Tiktok I have made people laugh and entertained with music and also taught some people a few guitar lessons. Its been a great experience so far, and I look forward to expanding my viewing and increasing my likes and followers. Live feed has also been important to my personal channel and I look forward to the day I can celebrate being verified, as that is my next Tiktok milestone. Thanks for the opportunities that Tiktok has given me so far and its a definite 5 star review from me"
"Literally false advertising and spyware. China is using this and 50 other apps to spy on other countries, and google play and the AppStore removed millions of reviews. This goes against the human right of free speech - which China doesnt follow anyway (HongKong protests). This app is for simps and cringe crackhead-energy girls that are too scared to ask for ketchup or a straw at McDonalds"
Tiktok. Ok listen this app is the best why trump trying to do this so lets get on to what I am actually talking about it is so entertaining you would refuse to use any other app but everyone should download this app as the first thing
Raja. Its Easy To Use and reliable always ever Tik Tok Trustable Like other Aap Facebook Not trustable Your data photos memories never secure on Facebook once your account disabled by Facebook you loose your data and Facebook will Disabled your account any time any region so Tik Tok Better Aap I trust Tik Tok because Facebook broke my beliefs five times so Facebook not good at all but Tik Tok trustable thank you Tik Tok love you Tik Tok
Awesome.  People cant see you if your on private . Can find your friends. Can message . Moderates rude personal messages
Tiktok review follow @mantasha03 on tiktok. This app makes my day best app ever totally worth it. New incredible releases of song and such an amazing dances so what you waiting for download nowwww
"Problem. Its a good app it Just sends fake notifications. It said someone I dont know liked my video even though Im private, then it said someone sent me 2 messages and I checked and no one did Stop doing this"

"Chinese spyware app. This app literally was opened on my phone when I deleted it a couple of hours ago, showing that they are spying on people who install this app, Tories should block/ban this app also in the UK Screw China"
Tik tok is a dangerous Trojan horse for the communist party of China dont download. The app is being used by the communist party of China to spy on us and you should stay clear of this app
"Saved the Day. Having so much fun on this App. Incredible talents, tips on living, cooking and great art and jokes. Join, there&#39;s something in it for you "
Love tiktok. I love tiktok it is so entertaining I use it everyday for like 5 hours or something I love posting on it I love being on it if you spy on me you will see how much I use it it is so useful I can never live without tiktok my mom says only be on tiktok on Saturday and Sunday but I break the rules I use it every single day whoever mad e tiktok I love you sosososoos much thank you a lot
Its the best. Incredible Amazing Definitely get thisBest app in the history of lifeHelps improve cooperationI love this app so much
"Hate It. Absolutely terrible, steals your data, the dances and comedy are really cringey, and I sick of hearing  renegade wherever I go. This app is the definition of quitting life, I lost all my friends to it and dont even get me started on privacy, Im considering moving to India just to be away from this monstrosity"
"Super funny love this app. If you need a laugh or are looking for life hacks or information on just about anything, this is the app for you"
False information. The app is full of false information and politics. The only people on this app that are actually intelligent get cancelled because they have different opinions. The community that we call  « alt » and «  the boys » are always fighting. Great app but miserable community
"Bad. This is the stupidest, most inane app to ever walk this earth. The intention of this app is to do cringeworthy dances, and it also sends your data and IP address to a server in China. Do not install"
"Terrible. This app promotes sexualizing underaged girls and boys, allows challenges to be posted that threaten lives of the users, and are all around stupid, steals music and more. I used this app for a total of one week out of curiosity after watching a lot of videos on it. I was not impressed, I will never use this app again and I recommend you never do either"
Stop. BRING BACK MUSICALLY NOW WHY ARE YOU USING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO SPY ON US
Garbage pedo China app. Time wasting pile of garbage China those scum collect ur data
"Amazing Just incredible. Tiktok is absolutely amazing, i couldn&#39;t ask for a better app. Its made me find more songs made me feel more confident and it&#39;s just so much fun in general. This app is seriously the best and if you ever download the app you&#39;ll fall in love with it"
Pure addiction. Warning dont get one if you want a normal life or much privacy.  It takes hours out of your life.  It might. Have saved mine too. Made some really good friends though
"this review is from a titkoker. hey, lol. yeah its a good app and stuff but like I downloaded it as a joke and now Im addicted. "
Great but definitely room for improvement. I think its an amazing app however it takes up an assortment amount of data but other than that great app
"My personal opinion. I love TikTok it is great fun and I love watching other peoples content,I have been on the app for quite a while ever since musically and what I liked about musically was that you could be your self and you could be any age without people commenting`get of the app your too young and there are a lot of old men on this app commenting on young girls posts"
"TikTok is the worst app for only 1 reason. There is a few but the main one is the community guidelines. Not only are they insanely stupid, millions of big creators get banned for NO reason. They ban people who look under 18, even if they have showed ID, big privacy concern, and more.Worst app"
Love this app. This app is great but careful you might loose track of time
Get it. I love TikTok its fun that ur able too watch videos that are made for you I 100% think you should download its (this is my opinion also)
"amazing app totally recommend. Tiktok is a great app if you want to watch entertaining videos, hilarious content and if you want to learn how to do fun dances. I highly recommend tiktok I do think this app should be 10+ as you can have privacy settings on. You can turn your comments off, dms off and its very protective. Theres so much amazing content being posted right now and I really recommend it for 10/9+ Thank you - happy costumer"
Bad. My account was banned over 8 times I did nothing wrong and made my acc private and get rid of the bots.. Do better tik tok
China spy app. DONT DOWNLOAD. Logs / copies phrases for the CCP. CCP made malware. China lies
Tok tik. I dont have tiktok im not allowed peace out This game is awful Please dont download the hackers on here can hack your life and threaten all your personal information. Jk this was a joke I love tiktok and yall should download it yall would love it I had it for a while but then I wasnt allowed it :( love ya tiktok peace out
"TikTok is the best. I am having so much fun with this amazing app, because it has all these great trends every week you can post. And its very easy to edit your videos, you can also post whatever you want like dancing, drawing, lip syncing , hacks, comedy and there is so much more things you can post. Theres filters as well and if you dont want everyone to see what you post, you can put your account on private so you can choose who sees your videos. So I would definitely recommend this app, because I am having so much fun with it, I hope you have fun with this app."
Pure addiction. Warning dont get one if you want a normal life or much privacy.  It takes hours out of your life.  However it also might have saved mine. Made some amazing friends too
central government of the People's Republic of China. I spy
China. Delete this app u spys
"Fab App. Since the last update, tiktok keeps crashing on my phone. Apart from that You loose track of time, so addictive but in a good way. There is something for everyone on this app"
. The age limit is not even needed this has given me hours of enjoyment and the privacy settings mean only my friends can see my videos
TIK TOK IS TOURTURE. The people using this app are so cringeworthy and weird also I fell like I am being watched constantly as the codes reveal that this app is spying on you please if you are a parent do not let your child use this app
"Suggestion Idea . Im fairly new to the app and I am absolutely loving all of it so far. I love comedy, dance and I am finding very helpful advice for building my personal design business too. I thought itd be a good idea for tiktok to offer a filing system for the likes feature. This would make finding liked business tip posts and liked dance tutorials that I am specifically after so much more efficient (much like IG saved folders and Pinterest boards). So much love "
TikTok. I just heard China owns TikTok and they have been selling everyones posts and emails and probably phone number. If your email is linked to your bank account they could steal money
is this a spy app lol.    yæ
Terrible. Steals your information
"Great App For Time Passing. If You Bored, Watch TikTok Great App To Pass Time But Does Get a Bit Too Addictive Warning. Make Sure You Have Enough Mobile Data. Use WiFi is the Best Way To Save Data"
Im obsessed . Tik Tok is an amazing platform for either Personal or Business.( I have both) Its Fun and easy to use. I recommend it
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I have very recently discovered that this app is actually a spy, if you pay close attention you will see a slight glitch when you start the video. There is now a whole news report please guys do NOT download"
Tik tok review. Amazing app I am on it 24/7 it is soo addicting definitely should download if not already so many useful information on there and a great way to clam down 
"Bad. This app isnt good, it wastes your time, tracks your location, and its very toxic. There many things in this app that are innopropiate, so please people dont install this app, ESPECIALLY, KIDS"
Good but dangerous. Ive heard that China has cameras 8n there apps too so they might be spying on us.. it was better before it became tiktok its more dangerous but over all I like it.. but I prefer to delete it than start being tracked and get stalked and if you tiktok reply i dont care what you say i know it is not safe Ive heard China keeps cameras all around even now on tiktok
Payton. TikTok is a good app it might have some me inappropriate stuff butIt ask you if you want to watch it it or you dont so yeah download it
"Racist. Avoid. They steal your data. Constantly letting racists keep posts but remove people speaking out on racism, blocking black lives matter, making sure one one race always being at the top"
INCREDIBLE. This app has preserved my sanity for the last 2 years and anyone who disagrees/ dislikes it is a total moron.Xoxo Gossip girl
Tick tock is terrible. Chinese are tracking people and stealing there info 
"Racist app. Racist and has an incredible poor, irresponsible reporting system"
"TikTok friends. TikTok has given me an uplift not only in friendship, free to post and personal lives. Im accepted through out the world as I am and embarrassed so many lives on other accounts. Thank you much love Rosie "
China spyware. China can steal information and hack you with all passwords and delete everything so DELETE IT
"Create more security measures please. I get daily notifications from that same spam video: Want to get more followers?.I know Facebook did this and maybe other social media, but maybe create an option to allow who can tag you in videos/comments/content.Privacy Setting Example:Choose who can tag you in videos (add comments as another privacy setting):- Anyone- Friends- No OneBam. Done. Now I wouldnt get spammed daily... this is why I turned notifications off for Tik Tok. If this gets fixed, Id change to 5 stars and allow notifications again but until then, this just saves me the hassle"
"Incredible. I live this app, as a person with ADHD it really helps me to be able to post videos, it motivates me t makes content for people and I love seeing my community grow. I still havent blown up tho, even though I posted over 210 videos"
Crap. This is the crappiest app ever Ive had it for weeks and cant figure out how to use it. Theres no form of information on how to use it Waist of my bloody time
How. It is a bit glitchy and keeps logging me out of my account and I set up a personal account and it swapped it to a business account
Worst ever. This is the worst app I could ever download. Never download it ruins legit every songHas stupied trends and Chinese government tracks ur data
Tik tok is a really good app thumbs up . I love tik tok  So much because I learn dances and hacks . I share the app with my friends at school and its just for fun but Im learning more I love tik tok so much its the best app Ive played on and I have over 4320 likes WOW  Its not about the followers and likes its about having fun Im not bothered if Im not viral Im only 10 so my account is private and I should not show my identity I hope you guys enjoyed my review thank you tik tok aswell its a really entertaining app to play on  I had just  reached 11K TY SO MUCH EVERONE ESPECIALY U GUYS PLEASE SEE THISS
This app is not what you think. Yes people hate but you can block them and they say that older men ask personal things but you can have a private account and still have followers you can meet new friends and make videos just for fun Theres literally nothing wrong with this app
Tik tok. This is one of the best apps I have ever had and its for anyone you can find people like you to be friends with Also parents tiktok have privacy settings so your child can be safe. Thanks for reading have a good day
"Downloading videos. Hi, this is more of a question than a review, because I cant find anywhere else to ask this. So, I have uploading videos and people have wanted to download it, I turned on the allow downloads in privacy settings and before I posted the video, but it still wont work. What do I do?"
Tick tok. Its good app for entertainment and its easy to download and watch videos and make videos
"bad app. This app is so bad has really bad videos, not worth ur storage. And they posted one of my private videos and deleted all my videos and 2 people saw it. Im so upset they are making me sad and depressed so dont download the app. Have a good day."
Seriously. Its made in China and band in China it steals personal information
annoyed. TAKE THE FRICKIN PRIVACY OF FOR UNDER 16 NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A WHOLE NOTHER ACC THX ALOT
"Amazing. This app is entertaining, sociable and helpful. You can make internet best friends and socialise with your friends or classmates. But it can cause an addiction But otherwise its an incredible app"
"TIkToK is AWESOME. I love TikTok It is my favorite app So much fun, allows you to be creative  I have learned so much about cooking, household hacks & cleaning? Download and JOIN TIKTOK today"
"Amazing But. TikTok Is Amazing But I Heard China Is Using It as a Spy App, Is That True?"
"Newbie to Tiktok. At first heard lots of horror stories.  Decided to take plunge, its helped with making new friends and of course youre going to get nasty people. Theres privacy settings which helps Give it a go Follow people who share same interests, make friends be inspired. Lots of life hacks too"
My Favourite App. So thankful for an app that has brought me personal growth and experience. The opportunity to meet other amazing individuals. This app has so many amazing features. So glad to use my platform to spread love to those around the world thank you for allowing me to have the platform that I have
Tik tok. Is their a way to make it so people cant download ur videos without having it as private
"Make Tokyos kid friendly. Plzzzz make tiktok kid friendly cause Im a kid and there is thing that I saw that are scary, inappropriate content, bad for kids, etc also BLM accounts get shadow band and the app watches and spy on u and when u post a video the app watches it so write this more to spread that tiktok should have a kid friendly update now lets work on getting the app to one star and taking it off the App Store unless u want China spying on"
"JensenzoE. I enjoy TikTok a lot I love everything about it I also love how TikTok respects your privacy and doesnt ask for any personal information, it never glitches or stops working it is amazing"
"Entertaining but little problem. Hi, this app is incredible to use people can create music videos all around the world and make amazing masterpieces  Especially in quarantine where we have to stay at home .However, I am trying to log into my act but its saying the passwords wrong when I just changed it and it is not letting me add my other account ... Before tiktok was called tiktok and change a lot I had never had issues like this one before when it was musically (not trying to  be rude) so if u could fix it Ill truly appreciate it and my accounts are Aneeya.xx and Aneeya_xx"
"Unable to watch lives. I love tiktok but since getting a new phone I cannot watch lives, I have no access to lives (Im in my 30s) any other device works fine, Iv emailed, asked for help and nothing, ruined my TikTok experience and the app"
Not the best app but I do like it a lot. I think personally that setting up an account Is a little too personal I dont think u should have to put in your date of birth because there are kids that want to have a fun time like the adults do on this app because they can dance to music they can sing its fun for everyone
"China. Want someone to spy on you, download this app. Otherwise keep scrolling"
LOVE IT. Its nice BUT STEALS UR PERSONAL INFORMATION ITS BANNED IN AUSTRALIA
Used to be fun. Tik tok used to be fun. Just used to be people posting funny videos without any political content or people harassing each other over the food they eat or their own personal views. Tiktok is literally filled with little kids imitating adults cyber bullying and no one is doing anything about it. No wonder kids these days are so nasty and so are people in general. Like wasnt the purpose about peace and harmony? Literally I get vids encouraging people to die because they eat meat or people getting angry over spilt milk. Theres a lot of good videos but now people just do virtue signalling. Its boring
Review. I spend hours on Tik tok It blows data so be careful
Best app. Hello tik tok I just want to say i love your app But i dont like those pedophiles and racist and those fake Japanese girls who track ip because its not a safe place for kids But besides that i love your app
BAD DONT DOWNLOAD. IT CRINGE AND FOR SOME REASON IT TAKING LOADS OF INFO FROM ME
"Supereb app. This app is incredible, really helped a lot of people in this critical situation (covid19) to keep them busy. Stay home stay safe Thank you TikTok "
Spys on you. Spys on everybody
Tik tok. A place to have fun make friends not worry about this crazy world we live in  Tik tok I just love it it allows me express myself and not take life so serious Allows me express myself make friends.. i wish we could know who shares or safe our personal video and who spam my tik tok would be nice
Tim Tim. Tim tok is the best app for people to express people they can talk to friends dance sing life hacks pranks really anything this app I rate 5 stars I recomend you getting this app to find more info call 07487248203
Tiktok randomly banned my duets and comments. Hi tiktok can you please turn my duets and stitches back on I dont know what happened but it comes up as tiktok did this to protect your privacy but I want to duet people or my friends and they want to duet me but it doesnt work account: Erin..d
I love his app :). Have a incredible time on this app every day helped express myself so much I found new confidence thank u
just wow. how is this app free i mean its incredible 
"TikTok. Would be nice to allow emails be an optional exception to use instead of phone numbers, having no phone and not being able to send a personal message on TikTok is tiring and a little disappointing"
Very good but. I highly recommend this app but there are bugs where people can track your location
Unbelievable. Not good security and privacy
love it. idc if they have my data i love china 
"Public account. Hey, I was wondering how to separate your private videos from your public ones like how your liked videos are separated. Please help. Thank you"
Fhagsjdghey. This app is terrible Reading this one star because this is not a good app for children Ive had it before and asked for all my info and is this app has inappropriate videos I thought I could make the skittles meme on here no problem but no I cant just I have to give you all my information and its terrifying goodbye to you sir
So fun. Tiktok will never be bad ever well at least after we find out whos SPYING ON CHARLIE
Censored by China. Controlled by communist party of China. Any political comments are censored. Is it possible that it tracks you? Be careful
Fun app. Its a good app and easy to use features  I think it would be nice to be able to categorise liked videos and followers/following. Also Im having an issue with push notifications. I have it turned on in my phone settings and tiktok settings but I dont receive notifications for when someone Im following posts new content and goes live. This is really annoying. I have already updated the app as well as removed it and downloaded it again. Have a fix for this???
Do not get. This app has hackers only if I could give it 0 stars than I would do not recommend they hack into ur phone
My opinion. This is the best social network site in my personal opinion . I seem to have strayed almost completely away from Fb- insta and Twit
Addictive. Its bloody additive Its eating my data Lol
"Low IQ. Everyone who use tiktok have a iq below 50 thats incredible how yall are so stupid using this app. If u spend hours looking at that, well my friend take a serious look on yourself"
"Great content. Love the content on here. A lot of trash, but a lot of incredible humans sharing amazing things"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE but. This app is such and incredible app but as lots of others have said, it can be EXTREMELY toxic. I have reported lots of very mean things and Tiktok has done nothing....and also the sweet sweet little fanpages who just want to support someone get so much hate  and it is extremely unfair on them so please fix this xxhope you all have an amazing day "
"UNINSTALL ITS ALL SPYWARE. If your child has this app uninstall it off of there iPads , iPhones. It tracks where your located and also keeps camera and microphone active at all times. This app needs to be gone and for good such a addictive app. My self doesnt use it as Im 20yrs old and have a life. Wake up people"
Tiktok. It is the best app ivv ever downloaded on my phone I watch it all the time I totally recommend it. Download it now
"AWFUL IM BEING HACKED. I got to 500+ followers and my likes started disappearing and my followings and my followers and now its all gone all my vids where deselected it happened to my friends too they said that the hacked posted a sexist video saying to kill all men this is the worst app I have SVER downloaded I worked so hard to get to 500+ and I got hacked, I HATE TIK TOK NEVER DOWNLOAD IT Im in a panic right now because I dont know whats happening. My account was called official.Olivia52 And my friends was Asherpup1 now it is asherpup2 and has a sexist vid up I warn you dont download this app"
"Where to start??. I am so addicted to tiktok and spend hours scrolling through vids or skits or vines or hacks etc that people all over the world have put time in to . You can include anything in ur vids and the editing options are amazing . Privacy is changeable, you can have private or public acc and restrictions can be added. Tiktok is a great way to keep in touch with friends and watch their vids. Overall 5/5 stars - amazing "
"China stealing all our information, BUYER BEWARE. 1dirty??propoganda"
Tic tok is stupid. Tictok is spying on you and China is trying to take over the world using tictok as their weapon
I love tiktok. Its just incredible the best app EVER
"Its super awesome. Hey, just to let you know, youre going to love this app. Just dont hesitate, download it "
Bad app dont download. Its honestly a badly structured repetitive app and it has spam ads on all platforms i
TikTok is the best. This app I enjoy I just love the fact its changing peoples lifesI love scrolling through TikTok to find incredible content creaters
Download this app. If you download this app it will make your day it has life hacks challenges pranks it such a good app its so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so                                                         GREAT
why tik tok is bad. small harmless creators get banned for no reason and it uses lots of data and it is probably just a scam so China can see what we are interested in and use this to sell stuff to us. overall meh cos def live without it
"TikTok for the Win  Every Time. I love this app. It makes me so happy. The talent and knowledge on here is incredible. I just like to watch, Im not a creator. TikTok has brought so much joy and happiness into my life "
"Questionable Origins and Practices. Lots of racist and otherwise discriminating practices by by the users as well as by developers and moderators, not to mention censorship and privacy issues"
ENTERTAINMENT AT ITS BEST. great app to download just to watch people make your day
Tik toks da best. I recommend getting tik tok it is a bit addicting try not to get addicted but other that thats its an absolute #1 game to get plus you can make a private account so no one  can see ur videos so plz get it You will enjoy it Its entertaining and supports everyone and any type of person you are They dont share any info about you or anyone else Just dont forget never use hashtags because even if your accounts private it will still go up on the internet so dont
"Doodoo app. Steals your info, oversexualizes young girls, significantly reduces attention span, pushes chinese pro governement propaganda and censors the truth regarding the communist party, this app is the biggest cyberthreath society has ever known"
"Love it. Its an awesome app we all use TikTok at my place, yeah my boys mostly for their games but the features are incredible and free and on the plus side if you follow the right people, you get some wonderful ideas. Its good for entertainment too TikTok over fb "
"no regrets. honestly i first downloaded it as a joke but now i cant stop watching or making tiktoks. i mean u get everything on here you get funny, serious, dance, scary, sad, adventure just overall amazing entertainment. and it keeps track of who you follow and what videos you like so that it can give you more videos that you will enjoy. you can even tell stories. overall it is amazing and i have no regrets"
please add group dms and close friends list. ok soi am absolutely in love with tik tok and i am so addicted its such an amazing app to express you creativity or find others creativity but please PLEASE add group dms the amount of times i wanted to talk to my friends through the dms but i wanted all of them to just realise that i cant is so devastating. people reading this might say oh use instagram they have group dms yes but some of us dont have instagram. oh what about text messages also yes but i dont want to give random people (that could be 40 year old men(we never know)) my phone number or email address just so i can have a group chat to send tik toks to or talk to i think tik tok will just be that little bit better if group messaging was added. jeez that was long lets hope this one isnt as long. i think tik tok should have kinda like a private story thing where you can chose who can see a tik tok i know you can chose friends only in the privacy settings of the tik tok but that includes everyone you follow that also follows you and for most people thats not the close close friends that you want seeing your random posts. both of these are only suggestions that i obviously feel very strong about. in no way possible am i trying to give hate as i said before i love this app and use it everyday i just think that these small changes can be benefited by everyone. lol idk  sorry if you read all of that.   Hey @Lily5112  Thank you for taking the time to reach out. TikTok is growing and evolving every day and we couldnt do it without such loyal and honest fans like you The way we keep the app and the community working together so well is by being in touch
Tick tok. There are very funny people it make you happy there are hacks that you can do and it keeps you busy and you are allowed to do your own download it
Weird app. Its so addictive and it clearly spies on you (serious)
"Please dont download. Terrible. Absolute trash. I know I sound critical but honestly, it is. It wastes space , steals your data and 7 yr olds are legit opening pubic accounts for the world to see. Sorry 14 year old girls , it has to go"
"Enjoyable. This app is amazing through this time right now. It cures your boredom everyday I could say i will only be on TikTok for 5-10 minutes then two hours pass. Also, it&#39;s making me feel better making TikToks because i can speak to the screen but people can see what I&#39;m saying ITS INCREDIBLE and i can even make TikToks to certain people. I prefer TikTok to musically because all musically was was lip syncing but TikTok has way more things than lip syncing it has (dances,singing and etc. TikTok lets make it the app of the year. In conclusion, i realy enjoy TikTok. "
Its a little inappropriate but addictive and fun. Its good fun but it can see and hear everything unless you have the microphone and camera off and it steals your data and gives it to the Chinese and when you have 1000 followers you can go live but it bans you for stupid reasons and can fully ban you and it still has a lot of inappropriate behaviour and I know its a 12 but its got like 18 behaviour language and actions but its bad because you can be any age and still make an account but you just lie about your age which it should have some stricter rules but not to strict because it will be no fun other wise so I think you should do something about the inappropriate actions and language in it because loads of little kids have it
"Sketchiest app yet. Take my 1 star review as a 0Your app is racist, homophobic and transphobic. Not to mention how the app collects all you personal data"
"Frustrated. I really enjoy wasting my time and disassociating with the app, but it has refused to load more then a couple of videos at a time after turning off and on data and Wi-Fi multiple times, closing the app, and restarting the phone all multiple times I deleted and reinstalled the app.  Now all of my drafts are gone which I dont understand because when I reinstalled tik tok to this phone when I got it I had my drafts from my last phone"
Great but. Tic-Tocis an awesome game but it is like a door into the device that you wach it on. People can hack into your phone or iPad and delete every single thing. They can evean hack into your bank account and steal all your money
Average App. I think that Tik Tok is Average. It has ups and downs to it. I believe that if it was run by a better company we would all have no problems with it. Its just the fear of data and stuff. I still like to use it though. Overall Average or Mid app
Great App. 5 out of 5. Hated this app and refused to download it. But now I love this app. Cant get enough
Chinese government spy. Tik tok is one the government chinese spying tools
Best App Yet. It gives me the chance to reach 1 billion users to build my personal brand. My account is @theeducatedgambler and Ive grown over 25k in 1 month Download the app if you havent already
Angry. Tik tok is so stupid my sister had her account hacked by people and then had to get rid of her account so she made another one and got 1 thousand follows people then go and steal her videos and steal her vids with her in and tik tok bans her account how stupid can tik tok be ban my sister account for other people stealing her videos pretending to be people . The user got all her friends and everything to report her even tho she just told them to stop using her vids of her . Her account was hulkgg Tik tok really needs to sort the issues out and dont ban people account who have their things taken
"TIKTOK IS THE BEST. I love Tiktok it can be addictive but it is fun you can watch videos, you can make videos you can share videos. I could go on forever. If you dont want people you dont know watching your videos you just simply have a private account. I recommend this app"
Hes spying. My dad says a government is spying on you
Tik Tok is the  best. This application is so informative and can give you the best information out there. I love the personal experience and legal advice and the many families that post their lives. 90% of the talent is great and 10% of the critics are true haters. Make sure you comment and follow the people you like and hit the heart button. But always comment. Lets tik tok
"this sucks. china spying on you, pornography, abusing dogs and children, dont get this"
AMAZING APP. This is a AMAZING app download it if your having a bad day just watch tiktok
Tiktok rating. In my personal opinion tiktok should grow more it is very helpful thank you
amazing. So I&#39;ve only had it for a few months and it is amazing Though I kinda wish I didn&#39;t have to put my email or phone number in cause my mum won&#39;t let me get an account cause of privacy I wouldn&#39;t mind getting no money for it I just wanna do it for The fun
I love this app. This app I am addicted there is so much to do and its honestly incredible 100% recommend
"My review . I lovee this app its very entertaining I lose track of time sometimes. This app has taught me new things, like life hacks or cooking videos I 100% recommend to get this app"
Great app. Lots of entertaiment and good information
"TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time & days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL  One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Im in the good mood if I am on TikTok because I am not others that they still posted their beast mood hahaha , Please TikTok why I am not yet viral ? Others even theres no effort when they dance but they have millions who views .Well, li dont know why sometimes NO VIEWS ??? I am very good here "
TikTok. Amazing app very addictive its incredible and the people on the app are so kind
Boring af/ useless. Useless app literally it wastes your time and you dont learn much useful information. Its so boring.... you get no enjoyment and information via this app
"Spy ware. Loved  the app, not the spyware in the app "
"Awesome. Love this app, opens my eyes to information I wasn't hip to, way better and Han Facebook but don't tell Mark"
The thing is. I want to have tiktok but my parents wont let me. I tried to download it but I have to log in. I watch tiktok stuff on yt and its rlly cool. Please let me download it without putting in a email or something. I only want to watch gacha and roblox tiktoks. Please 
tiktok opinion. incredible app
Id give it 1 1/2 of a rating if I could. 1. Privacy concerns. I heard that it uses your mic when ur not using it but idk2. reddit good
tiktok. tiktok is a great app to be inspired by and for entertainment. its a good app for 9+ but you still need to be careful. if some videos upset you make sure to click off straight away and never share personal details about you and family my fav tiktokers are charli damelioaddison raenessa barretbut remember tiktok is full of drama too and is too much stress especially for -9. Download at your own risk its good for entertainment and being inspired to. its bad for the drama and some videos being uploaded currently
Sx bots. Tik tok is a great app but there has been some robots on this app and they have been liking peoples comments on videos and that will slowly lead the people to the robots profile. I dont think its safe because their profile has a link to a lot of nudes and its NOT kid friendly :( They also track people
Love it. Amazing and makes sure your privacy is granted xx
Tic tok. This app is AMAZING idk who made it but its incredible I watch for hour and cant stop and loads of people are on it and I can be too I even have my own account (btw its @jesus.is.life_asia go follow pls it will really make my day)srry back the review I can like and add vids that I LOVE to my favorites u should TOTALLY get this app and plus it free to download pls get it Im going to go watch it right now so get the app BYEEEEEE
TikTok bad. TikTok then shadow bans ur videos and take them down for going against giulated sorry spelling mistake the privacy turns then they dont give u ur live button once u got 1k cuz I am on 1.4k and no live button
"Tiktok is amazing. Tiktok is a wonderful app to download and recommend it 100% you can watch videos, post them and much more"
"Not a good app do not get. Tik tok, I used to have this app but people can find you whilst finding your information and track you down. People can get hurt from tricks and its just an app were you look at yourself and make videos its an addicting app and you cant get of it you spend less time with your family and more on that app, Im sorry for who made this but its true cya"
very bad app. it daking too much data and battery
"Moo. So I was reading all of the reviews and it sounds like ppl are becoming obsessed with this app. And its not good for them, lots of ppl are saying great app Im on there 24/7And that not good for there health plus kids use it and there is some inappropriate stuff that is not good for children so. The app is great for older people not kids do please ensure that your kids are using the app safe and not giving personal information to the Internet. And posting inappropriate things. Thats all I wanted to say I hope you guys all have an wonderful day -Jan,29,2021-"
Review. This app is not appropriate for kids or really any age its a spy app if your reading this and your about to download it dont I have had horrible experience with this app
So useful. I thought itd only be people dancing but its so useful. You can choose the content you want to see like life hacks and financial information
"Love it, but concerned. Enjoying tik tok but worried about its connection with Chinese government. Although nothing I share could be considered spy worthy. They might get ahold of Richard pics I sent my wife"
Good but bad. Its a good app to have fun and all I loved it but this app is fake happiness and addiction and there are bad people on there and some people fake age and can get caught or if your like under the age limit then people can track were you live although its a good app. Follow me on willowdawolfy :&gt;
"It is sooooo addicting . Honestly it is great for everyone as there are lots of privacy settings But the reason why I gave it a 4 not a 5 is because disabled, black, Asian and members of the LGBTQ+ community have been getting banned for things as simple as spreading awareness about issues But if that could be stopped Im sure everyone would agree with me xx"

Sells your videos. Dont let your kids download this app
"Meh. I think that musically was bette. It was innocent and fun. I personally dont have this app, because there is inappropriate videos on there. It is also a location user, it can track where you are when your there. Even just the simplest indication in one of your videos can get you kidnapped, murdered or worse. It is a dangerous app, although some of the content is creative and funny. Thats all for me now Stay safe everyone, this is deadly virus, and even if you dont think itll affect you, it can. You can never tell what the future will bring. ;)"
"Love it. At first I just downloaded it to watch things but then it got more and more addicting as time went on, pass all of that, its an amazing app"
TiKtOk dAtA. nOiCe
AMAZING MUST GET. Tiktok is honestly incredible and I couldnt live without it at this point. Ty guys for making this AWESOME fun app Ly omg
AMAZING. I love tick tock it is the best app in my life it gives you video and u can make a video your self you can post it on private or public pls download tick tock now xxx 
Direct messages. Tik tok is great really enjoy it but I have been trying to request data for the direct messages but every time I try it says that the data that I have requested is expired. Please can you help me with this
Made in China. I have stopped using it as I have concerns for my privacy
Tiktok is very good. Tiktok is a very fun and enjoyable app. I recommend you download it. Sometimes it can be very annoying eg get rid of my video once Ive recorded it but other than that its really good
I love tik tok. I love this app because you can make your own videos and you can also learn new songs. I also love This because you can watch other peoples videos and magpie some dances off people. This is great because if you dont want to be seen by stranger then you can have a private account that only your friends can see you. xxx I really recommend downloading this app
"Tictoc. Love this app. Just filled with some lovely people just wanting to have a good time, share personal stories, advice and just bringing the world together. As we all know the world is a scary place at the moment so this app and the videos make you believe in humanity. Plus no matter where you come from or what past you may have we are all still out to have fun and join together. Peace out "
TikTok. I really like tik tik its very addicting but I just dont like how they spy on us
"AMAZING APP. I LOVE THIS APP ITS AMAZING  IT HAS SO MANY THINGS TO WATCH LIKE LIFE HACKS, DANCES, FUNNY VIDEOS AND MORE I WOULD SAY ITS WORTH THE DOWNLOAD"
"Wow incredible. This is by far the best app that I have downloaded on my phone. You dont need to pay for anything just make an account and start creating content There is more than just dance vids theres cooking videos, hacks for lots of different things, etc etc. TikTok has taught me how to dance so much better and generally be a better person I hope to see new and improved updates coming "
"The notification view update makes the nearly app unusable. The notifications inbox update makes the app miserable to use & interact with comments. You have to dig deep to even find comments and then it only shows you a small portion of them because when you get past 20, there is a tab that shows people you may know instead of the rest of your comments. The people you may know tab pops up constantly too, because even if you have contacts shut off it STILL accesses them. It uploaded all my phone contacts & Fb friends despite never having that feature turned on & intentionally double checking it was off. Invasion of privacy for sure. They  updated the home page/inbox layout too. So you cant just click the inbox icon and see all activity. You have to click like 2-3 things to get to the all activity tab, then select comments or likes etc. even then, its giving thousands of unnecessary notifications so the ones you want to see are buried. I can never get my notifications tab to not have notifications. Its really irritating"
"The Diversity. I am officially addicted to Tik Tok , I am impressed with how much you can do on this app such as the filters and then change the music or add a voiceover to make it personal. The fact there are all age groups is nice too and my  son is on this app so it makes us be able to keep in contact and up to date with whats new. I laugh at so many peoples videos , make friends and have fun"
It is good. Tik tok is good because you can make videos and post it to your friends or you can make it privacy so all you can watch it and I dont make my videos Private I show it to my friends even if I dont get comments but I enjoy it and Im not telling a Lie I only make 16 videos Im going to make more and if you are a kid and you think youre the only one no youre not theres lots of people younger people and all the people Im just a child Im 11 years old and I make videos on TikTok and I like it so if I was you I prefer to download this
Rumours. Rumour says that u guys sell data info to black markets
"TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time &amp; days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL  One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Im in the good mood if I am on TikTok because I am not others that they still posted their beast mood hahaha , Well, lest have some fun in here Thanks"
My Favourite App. So thankful for an app that has brought me personal growth and experience. The opportunity to meet other amazing individuals. This app has so many amazing features. So glad to use my platform to spread love to those around the world thank you for allowing me to have the platform that I have Love spreading love
China. Data stealing mothafuckas
TIKTOK. TikTok is a very fun app to use it is like vine but is still in use and you dont have to post to have a fun you can spend hour watching videos I would just make sure you dont have to go somewhere before using it because you can be on there for hours and still lose track of time
Why is TikTok the best. TILTOK IS THE BEST BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE AND WATCH VIDEOS ITS APPROPRIATE FOR UNDERAGED PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT WANT PEOPLE YOU DONT KNOW TO WATCH YOUR VIDEOS JUST PUT YOUR ACCOUNT ON PRIVATE
my daughter got sent nudes. this is horrible and outrageous i want my kids to be safe online NOT to be sent graphic pictures by an older man my daughter is only 13 and i am afraid that she has been sickened because of this also THIS STORY IS NOT TRUE but do you know what is true?tik tok selling YOUR data to china without your permission and the amount of creeps on here disgusting
Awful. Awful app that promotes horrible culture and full of child predators. Not even going to mention the excessive privacy and date sharing from parts of the Chinese government
". I have been using this app since 2017/18 i love this app and use it everyday , i recently privated all my videos (for privacy reasons) but now i cannot view the videos , they are not appearing on my account . I have lost 500 videos  I dont want to carry on with this happening , i might consider quitting"
Great app but freaks me out a little. Ok lets get this straight tiktok is a great app and makes me laugh and all kinda stuff. Theres some tiktok that are inappropriate and scary. Like people show scary images theres creepy music and that. I also found out that it tracks your location but this was made in China so if your from  Europe and other countries your properly fine. I love this app if you ever wanna laugh or just have some fun you should definitely download it 
Tick tock is crap it glitches spams questions about u and band u for no reason. They offer lynx ban ur account for doing nothing wrong they ask personal questions most of the content is racist homophobic and rude there r many hackers
"AMAZING BUT. I love this app but until it changed too TikTok little kids age 7-10 online date This app is for comedy, fun, and more. Not for little kids to date They never know who is behind that screen,its also very addictive which is fine but not when it comes to homework and school and other things it changes there life this app. Which is not good for there brains A app like this should not be changing there attitude and there life Kids also share there personal details such as there school there age and address for fan mail etc.. probably without parental premison (not every kids btw) part from that its a great fun app"
"Tik Tok:). This app is amazing I used to be but as soon as I got Tik Tok my whole life changed even my mum got Tik Tok and she loves it she has so many friends and this is why you should get this amazing, life changing, incredible app called Tik Tok "
Go to hell. Please uninstall you damn internet and stop spying on us CHINA
"Cant get enough. There is so much I truly enjoy about TikTok. I love the recipes, the Heart String stuff, the HACKS, the Comedy, the REAL ADVICE that you can use for your everyday life, the incredible dancers just to name a few. Ok I love going live and meeting the TikTok community. Keep it going. P.S. I wish there was a customer service phone number you could call when you have some questions and or concerns. Thank you TikTok"
"Perfect. Horrible, new spam points system constant pop ups to invite friends, requests to access contacts, taking lessons from Facebook and do not understand  the word no. One more pop up requesting personal information and we will solve it with delete"
Tik tok. I love it so much I end up having no data left
"Amazing app. This app is incredible, there are so many interesting and fun trends to do. People encourage and support each other to do what they love by helping people reach their dreams. But most of all creators are using their platforms to speak up for whats right and wrong"
Idk. A lot of people are saying they have personal problems because of the app but its because of other things to And u cant just not expect weirdos and homophobic people they are everywhere
This is a great app. With this app you can watch peoples videos. Use effects and make your own videos. This app is incredible
Love everything. I get a lot information and and many tips I love post pictures I get hither views then my Facebook and Instagram
Hi. This is a great app I love watching these fun videos and i stay on it all day so that is my review I hope you download it:)
"Tiktok. Amazing app, love spending my time on here and getting distracted and loosing track of time lmao- fun app"
"Love it. Incredible app, amazing content"
The worst app of the century. if you dont stop spying on your users youll be reported to the Victorian Police
Tick tock. Let me start off omg this app is amazing and it is the best app I have ever seen . And some things on there really inspire me I just love this app I think it is incredible and amazing  and Im so thankful for the people that made this amazing app
"TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time & days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL  One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Im in the good mood if I am on TikTok because I am not others that they still posted their beast mood hahaha , Please TikTok why I am not yet viral ? Others even theres no effort when they dance but they have millions who views .Well, li dont know why sometimes NO VIEWS ??? I am very good here  why theres instances that theres NO VIEWERS? I want to earn money here too"
Amazing app. This is such a good app it shows vedy cool things and stuff you would be interested in it shows life hacks and much more so you should download it right now :)
Amazing. I have 11.9k on this app.Tiktok has made me come out of my shell and has been an incredible thing to use when stuck at home during lockdown
Great app 1 suggestion. Reduce the amount of non violent content taken down. If a person is showing an UNLOADED gun for comedy or education purposes there is no need to have it listed as breach of privacy
"My rating. Tik Tok is a good app, however there is a lot of swearing on the app My uncle is in the navy and he might of told me something about this app Im not gunna share it with everyone as it may be private but I just want to warn everyone be careful If u are considering to download"
"My opinion on TikTok. TikTok teaches people to be so creative and make people happy  . All the people I know love TikTok , and I do to  :) this is my favourite app and it makes me feel so free to make what I like and do what I like  This app is incredible please never get rid of it "

Too tok. Tik tok is the best app on phone because you get to watch asome videos all day long
tik tok review. this is one of the best apps i have installed it has made me become more courageous and helped me learn things school couldnt i really recommend this app and think its should stay for years to come and to be passed down to the next generation. ive met some incredible and lovely people on this app and if it was to ever go i would be absolutely devastated. thankyou
"Tiktok is the best.. I love this app., it cheers you up when you feel sad, lonely, bored or even when youre happy its addicting with comedy, people relating to one another, making friends, giving life hacks, songs including dances you can all enjoy together if you think one video isnt what you want to see search and keep scrolling you will end up staying on this app for hours"
"#hacked . Someone hacked my account lol, they changed my password and my email I reported my account so many times it didnt get banned, they were going to leak my private videos and I remind you Im insecure, my account was also private, they changed it public, before I got hacked I was sleeping so I think the person who hacked me is on the other side of the world, there probably older then me, I asked all my cousins and friends to report my account nonstop, AND it still didnt get banned, so I asked my cousins if they hacked me they said no, I tried to get my account back using my moms phone number it just changed her password not mine, and I have some personal info on that account, and another complaint is, I FAVOURITED VIDEOS OF MY BULLY AND THERE GONNA THINK ITS MY CRUSH AND THERE GONNA COMMENT ON VIDEOS OH MY GOD IM GONNA FREAKING COMMIT "
Why. This is spy ware i
Is nice. This is important to read I love this app but they post scary things funny things and personal things i just want to say anyone under 14 please dont download the app
Spy. Just a big Chinese nonce app
Why did I get banned. Im Rlly mad I got banned for NO Reason iTs so weird I did nothing now all my followers likes data is gone now I had to make a new account and I cant use the Same name I only like it a little now :(
"Doesnt allow other people to duet me. Hey, I allowed duet for everyone in my privacy settings and my accounts not private but no matter how much I try, it doesnt let other people duet my videos for chains etc which is really inconvenient and I really dont know what I did wrong"
"love it. Tiktok is an amazing place to create. With their sky is the limit attitude, you are welcome to be yourself and endlessly express yourself. Although the algorithm can be ((frustrating)) at times, the chance at a platform/a voice is such an incredible opportunity. DOWNLOAD NOW"
messed up. Has videos of literal animal abuse and has an extremely toxic and dangerous community that ruins creators lives and even promotes harm. Also steals data
"Age problems. I am currently 12+ and Im not aloud this app but it is my personal favourite app out of all of them. But Im not aloud on this app because of all of the POVs and the swears I personally think the swears on this app arent needed. They arent actually funny at all. I do really love this app but these problems I have are very unnecessary and tiktok is a very brilliant app and I think you can sort this out, I would love it if you would because I really want this app. Thank you for reading my review. :)"
This. This app is incredible and inspiring it raises confidence and is also fun
Incredible and unstoppable. TikTok is one of the best apps I own. Not only is it entertainment for hours but also is always different. A striving community has come with this app
"Addictive. I love this app . It has changed my life with so many outlooks on things , the humour is incredible better than any tv show"
"HELPP. Hi my birthdate on tiktok is incorrect, so I downloaded my data I saw that tiktok has put my bod as 7th December 2005. That is incorrect its 12th July 2005. Im born in Australia, and are dob format is DD/MM/YY please fix this mistake my username is marylimxo"
"Stop. I think Ive seen over 3000 ads for Tik tok at this point (that legitimately is not an exaggeration, I have seen THOUSANDS of ads at this point) and I only installed to leave this review. Also stop stealing peoples information, thanks"
Soooo. I really love the app but maybe abit too much Sometimes I can stare at it for hours and I loose track of time. So be warned before downloading because you WILL become addicted 
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid  Gorgeous Beautiful Deal breaker Fab Sexy Fandabbydosy Sickening Delicious"
"TikTok. This is probably the BEST app I have ever used It has hacks,dancing,jokes,memes,animals I mean the list can go on forever and ever So stop wasting your time on Facebook or instagram and download TIKTOK  ( even though Instagram is good to )"
"Too Many Issues. The concept of the app is great, but it takes so much personal information, supports terrible things like racism and ableism, and is generally quite hard to use, both by being very inaccessible and not having the most basic of editing features. The algorithm is also extremely flawed; would not recommend"
TICTOK IS AMAZING. TICTOK HAS BECOME SUCH A GREAT. AVENUE FOR POIGNANT. SELF EXPRESSION   IN BOTH A CREATIVE OUTLET. AND A PERSONAL AND SPIRITUAL FOCUS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.  GREATER THEN FACEBOOK OR TWITTER OR INSTAGRAM EVER COULD. BECAUSE ITS FACE TO FACE  SELF EXPRESSIONS IN RAW HEARTFELT VIDEOS. . I LOVE. TICTOK. .  THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE. YOU CAN GO TOO SEE A SERIOUS HUMAN SELF RESPECTING PERSONAL TRUTH.   GIVEN.  FROM THE HEART.   EFFKADEESTOS .  THANK YOU . TICTOK.   CATCHSTEPHENS.  YOUR GREATEST FAN OUPAH.     YASOO. GREAT HEALTH   TOO ALL OF YOU WE NEVER SEE BEHIND THE SCENESAGAPE MU.  GLYKIA. SWEET
Best app . After months of refusing to download this I had to and I love it.So entertaining
Loved it. I really only got this app bc I wanted to look at SW content but oh my god did I underestimate it. The amount of creativity Ive seen has just been incredible and I always find an account I fall in love with and then recommend to my friends. Loved this app and when Im done Ill probably go back on. Bye
Tiktok. Hated it when musically changed to TikTok but its really exceeded all my expectations since then. Love the app and the only thing I think needs working on is some of the guidelines Not that they should change any but they should prioritise some more than others For example theres a TikToker breast feeding that takes the baby away from her breast every now and again where the breast becomes in full View of the camera. Yet my vid with a crop top and high wasted jeans gets taken down for adult nudity please sort your prioritys out tiktok
Bad bad bad. The government is spying on u with tik toc
"VonzyBoiFresh 100. I am starting to re-enjoy the app. Why I say re-enjoy is because in the beginning of TikTokers rise to addiction. Everyones videos were funny and inspiring. Then during the pandemic it became really really negative and uninteresting with its bad vibes with negative people posting stuff about conspiracy theories, bad news, culture appropriation, and stereotyping. I am a First Nations indigenous. I am from the Ojibwa tribe from Chippewa of the Thames First Nations, Ontario. Canada. With the power of social and TikTok videos. I re-grew my love for TikTok. All my indigenous community came out with their personal touching stories to be recognized as strong people and people being strong willed to share residential stories. The Every Child Matters movement is something that hit home for me. The power that TikTok did for my people to be recognized was very touching. For that. I like to say thank you. Miigwech, thank you. Vaughan G. Albert. VonzyBoiFresh "
Exposed. Apple caught them doing some funny things with my your information. You should not download this until it&#39;s solved
"Great app. This app is great for my kids its so entertaining and fun,but my kids have an account but its private the good thing is that u can set there account to private or public.So if u are looking for a smile download this app xxxx"
Love it. This app is a great app for when youre born home alone you just watch videos for hours and hours you make it a little offguard or off track I love this app so much there are a little spams here and there but other than that this app is a great app
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid  Gorgeous Beautiful Deal breaker Fab Sexy Fandabbydosy Sickening"
DONT DOWNLOAD. Its very cringe and probably full of Chinese spys dont download for your own safety
Funny app. Yes this app may have some things that arent quite right but it dose give some great information
Love it. Definitely not a kids app. Loads of people sharing a crazy amount of information and knowledge on everything Ive searched for
As its epic. But its made by some Chinese stealing company joking I only saw something about stealing information on YT by TikTok
Pls help me. Hi tiktok I cant seem to download it again what do I do it just says billing info and I did that and it didnt work what would you suggest 
TikTok. This app is incredible and also The best game in the world I come so happy to play this it&#39;s stuck in my mind every single day
THE BEST. Tik tok isnt a thing which makes u watch it ALL the time. Its just 15 second clips from people. U can do privacy settings so nobody can see the tik toks u make only ur friends (if u follow them on tik tok)honestly is THE BEST it releases stress and makes u feel amazing. There is not that much swearing. BUT ALL U GOT TO DO IS DOWNLOAD THIS APP
En lo personal a mi me encanta TikTok. 
Tiktok fyp and personal posts. My fyp is only showing me posts made days/weeks ago and every time i try to post it either doesnt post or only shows my followers. A lot of other people are experiencing this too. Please fix this problem
Its ok. My TikTok is keeping crashing with my wifi on and data I have tried everything please try and fix it
"Definitely recommend. TikTok is an amazing app. It allows you to get creative when making videos, but it also allows you to catch up with your family members favorite celebrities and just sit on the couch and laugh your butt off. You can learn cool recipes and life hacks(and Harry Potter phone spells). 100/10 wouldnt delete it"
THERE TAKING UR INFO. DELETE IT RIGHT NOW THERE TAKING UR INFO AND SAVING IT
"There are cyber bullies and creeps. Im just saying from personal experiences that once I was on, I wouldnt get off. I was staying up late and tired but so addicted I couldnt get off, there is innopropriate thing on the app so I wouldnt recommend for younger people the app itself is alright but if you are an adult and reading this do not let your child get this. Teenagers are gross on the app and it just isnt appropriate"
"Please help. I&#39;ve put in my phone number but it still doesn&#39;t let me send dms, please help. I tried looking in privacy settings but it didn&#39;t have the option &#34;who can send you dms&#34;"
The app is incredible. It doesnt madder what you like TikTok has it if you were on vine and you liked it you will love TikTok if you like dancing Comedy sports satisfying videos anything I bet you will find something just for you I have a TikTok I do boxing dancing comedy to @lil.tix if you want to follow but the app is awesome
"Tiktok review. With my personal experiences on tiktok I think its absolutely incredible.Most people on the app do nothing but compliment creators, it makes my day when you are scrolling through comments and find one that is written about  how you are beautiful and have value."
My Favourite App. So thankful for an app that has brought me personal growth and experience. The opportunity to meet other amazing individuals. This app has so many amazing features. So glad to use my platform to spread love to those around the world
Incredible. I have so much screen time from this app but who cares its so fun and entertaining 
"Minor issues. Some small issues. Minor at best. Some bugs, issues, data stealing and giving to the Chinese government to create a data profile on you, glitches, confusing, etc. not major issues. As long as you are fine for many people to have access to your private data with ease. 9 out of 10 dentists recommend"
Great app with such a variety of contact creators. This app is incredible
This app is absolute garbage. I went on it because I thought hey this is pretty cool. I regret ever downloading the app. All I saw was people doing cringe dances. That isnt entertainment or comedy its horror and torture for my eye balls
So it is good but. Tic tok is a good app with even better creative people but dont steal peoples data
Best app. I have been on this amazing app for a long time and it is incredible I cant live without it
tik tok. honestly i love tt so much it just wastes a lot of time but when im on it i enjoy seeing what everyone does and watching my friends videos/it could improve on being a non data game aswell but overall i love it

"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid  Gorgeous Beautiful"
Tikity tok. I only rated it 2 star bc it uses your camera and mic to spy on you and see what stuff ur into thats how you get stuff you like on your fyp so turn off camera and mic in settings when your not making tiktoks other than that its gooooood 
"TikTok thank you. As an Health care worker I really enjoyed here always especially during my break time & days off  Hope TikTok you will protect our privacy   Please TikTok make my videos go VIRAL  One of my leisure time but pls make my duet or any videos went viral  Im in the good mood if I am on TikTok because I am not others that they still posted their beast mood hahaha , Please TikTok why I am not yet viral ? Others even theres no effort when they dance but they have millions who views .Well, li dont know why sometimes NO VIEWS ??? I am very good here  why theres instances that theres NO VIEWERS?"
It alright. There is one problem though all the spam accounts saying like are you boys here or I am wonderful like pls can TikTok get rid of them
Addictive app. This app is soooo addictive Loose track of time which isnt a good thing
Amazing. Tik Tok is the best app I have ever gotten it lets me show people my dance skills and other things about me there are optional privacy setting to you can only have your friends following. It has made me gain confidence to dance and helped me with other skills and its even made me laugh Best app 
Is it good?. Nar it is not good bc the Chinese will steal your info
"amazing. this app is incredible. the content is targeted towards young adults and teenagers, so keep that in mind. there is so much to do on this app and its a great way to spend your free time. whether you like dancing, comedy, cooking or more, this is the app for you. become a creator or just simply watch videos. theres something for everyone"
Really good app. Tik tok is a really good app you can make videos and be live but be careful not to put real information or people can hack you and learn your location the owner is a company in China so stay safe and be careful online :)
TikTok is amazing. Addicting but incredible app
Very happy. Awesome app I have met so many truly amazing incredible people through it so very glad i download it
"no. ok so right now i now more things about tiktok. so is basically racist and theres a lot of swearing, ive also heard the creator made it to spy on people and for some reason i think its true cause the creator only made one app (tiktok) and the creator is very mysterious. ive also heard they were buying 5 star ratings and i also think that is tru because i went through the ratings and a lot of people that added a description rated it 1 star and i never saw any 5 star rating with any description and the 5 star ratings are like soooo much so justno i dont recommend you install or download this app its not good if you dont want your whole life to change from good to bad,your being spyed on dont post tiktoks"
Perfect. Tiktok is a beautiful app my personal favourite
"bad. copyright, steals info. chinese bad idots"
Great. I love it u can do dances voice overs like peoples videos follow them watch there vids and if u want no one not even your friends you can go on to private if u want your friends to see it press friends and if u want everyone to see it press public its great cause u can change the privacy settings add YouTube or instagram to attract people to your YouTube or Instagram account to also its fun to see your friends do dances and learn them I love tik tok
. I thought I would hate the app. Downloaded it and now I cant stay off it. I always find entertaining videos to watch. Never disappoints
"IMPORTANT. I have seen a lot of bots that will like your comment and the user is usually sexual in a way, like user828_tap..for__s3xx or something, when you go to the page its a link (Ive never clicked it) and that link takes your personal address info. Please, add some user moderation"
Goooooooood app: Tik Tok. I watch this app for hours on end and is sooooooo fun to watch DOWNLOAD NOW
Spy. Does tik tok spy on you I just would like to know because I love tik tok but Im a little bit worried if u spy on us

"Video on TikTok. The videos on TikTok are real people you can relate and interact with. There are videos of people you can identify with their daily struggles, many are so entertaining and funny. You watch them over and over, and some are full useful information.  They help make your day easier with the information and laughter. Thank you "
"Storys. This is UNACCEPTABLE. My draft are getting posted to my story. You dont know my family, WE WILL SUE U . I dont want my privacy to be out in the open . THIS HAS TO STOP"
"TikTok thank you.

"Racist. Prejudice. Collection of data of minors. This app has blocked the tag black lives matter and George Floyd in the midst of what is going on in the world.The app also allows racist posts, comments and conversations even after it being reported. The only consequences on the racism on the app comes from the internet overly searching for these peoples personal information to put them on blast.Finally this app has been collecting information and photos in minors who find their way into this app from children 9-17.This app is not safe"
Garbage - likely stealing data and deleting reviews. Bad
"Things i wish would ve changed. I love tik tok, it the best app ever. Whats good about it is that there are dances and people to connect with and seeing what people create. The only thing that gets on my nerve is that its named a Chinese spy tool please change tik tok just let everyone be safe Or is this fake? Is it not a spy tool?"
"I smell angry 5 year olds. Most of the 1 star reviews are from 5 year olds or raiders. TikTok (alt tiktok) is genuinely so entertaining. I could spend days on this app straight. People are also using it to spread awareness and positivity. TikTok is the best app out there. Also, about all this Chinese spy  stuff, just use an alt email or smth"
Fantastic Way to Share MY JOY. TikTok has truly changed my life I have found the most incredible community that appreciates FUN while sharing LOVE  forever &amp; beyond TheDuckShow1 @theduckshow1
Love ty. tt is a app where you can create things post stuff and have fun you can go viral watch other peoples videos and it I am incredible app
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid  Gorgeous"
"furries. this whole review dedicates my hatred to the furries, they are so awfully cringey and they started 3 wars over it, download at your own risk and did i mention that they steal your data?"
"Favorite app BUT insane levels of storage. This is my favorite app, but even after clearing my cache I STILL have to delete the app and re-install it because it takes up OVER 1 GB of data on my phone in just 1 week Fix the app storage issue and I will change this rating to FOUR STARS. Until then, this app deserves only ONE STAR"
Great app. This has got to be the best app I have ever used so if you want some good laughs and top of the line information this is your app you should use 1000000000000000000000000/10
"Crappy update. I was able to update the app once, but now it seems that I am unable to share any videos with friends. However, if I save the video in my personal camera roll, I can then go back and share with only 1 friend. Had to leave this review so maybe someone at tiktok will see and perhaps see if they can fix this glitch. They obviously dont troubleshoot problems that are reported. Do better"
China spy software do not download. They will steal your kids and your wife
TIK TOK. I love tik tok but it needs wifi which is a bit boring because I dont have data to use. So if you guys could maybe not have us use wifi or data that would be nice 4 stars
Bad. It is so bad i never write reviews of this when I had to its horrible in Chinese are spying on you and theyre gonna take you away so please dont get on it
Not a good game. There is some not appropriate things on this app and people in China collect you data so sorry but is not good
:). This app is incredible but the thing is people be putting so much work and get 1-5k views and other people just post a video of eating cake like Charlie damelio and get 2-5million views
"Biggest cancer of modern times. Tiktok is no doubt the biggest cancer of modern times, an designed to waste our time, and our privacy is at big big risk....you know why"
Great App. Its a fun app to use but the only thing is that there are children under the age of 13 on this app it really should be 18+ years old...but hey thats the parents job not tik toks job to be the parents.. & I also think that what I type in messages shouldnt be looked at by tik tok thats personal messages
I cant update it. Hi guys I just wanted to say I love this app and watching all the videosBut I came across a problem as I have not updated TikTok I can not put voice effects on and I want them as I do not want to speak in my normal voice because its kind of personal but when I went to update it I couldnt it wouldnt let me so now I cant post videos unless its with an audio but I do not like dancing so I wont be able to post videos at all
The reason why I hate Tik Tok. I hate TickTock the reason why is little kids cant even sign in their parents think its for money and selling other stuff for it your iPad phone computer gets hacked because I dont even know anymore its just bad rating of one star
Amazing. I think this is a incredible app to make little videos and laugh at funny videos on home page.when I fist started using this app it was just life looking at all ur friends pots and all your favourite people.you can also text on this app love itttt
Review. Its a great tool when used the right way. Information and the entertainment is priceless
"Plz make me go viral. Now I know you guys are a bunch of stinkies so can I go viral cause I gave you a five star plz?? That would be epic Btw can I have 1/4 of my data your probably selling to the black market?? How much money did you make from it because I want some Thatll be nice. Okie by tik tok,From Ceo_of_Jellie"
"AMAZING APP. This app is incredible there is videos for everyone from comedy, dances, singing, pets and many more I highly recommend to download. Tiktok is my favorite app and Im obsessed, download for much fun"
All these reviews are fake. Guys Tik tok doesnt steal i formation it doesnt take ages to download its perfectly fine and safe (The only thing bad about it is that its sooo addicting)
Addictive but fun. Probably stealing my info but at least I get to watch clips and videos about people
"READ IMPORTANT. First of all, This app is soooooo racist bro and homophobic , including toxic. Im gonna list every reason u shouldnt download this game : Toxic, Racist, Homophobic, and rich people flex off like their trillionairs, app tracks user info,VERY SEXUAL,VERY INNAPROPRIATE FOR KIDS . So parents or old teens like me do not download this game for kids"
"Chinese government spy app, 50 cent army. Tik tok is one the government chinese spying tools. 50 cent army"
"THE BEST. I love this app I downloaded it just to watch the memes and posted a few, 62 of my videos has gone viral with one has over 300k likes, its so easy, just post something funny that people like to watch. Love the app 100% recommend downloading it (if u get it follow me) @harrisonfraser "
Comments. So I made my friend comment on my tiktok video but for some reason it wont show up on mine I check the internet Connection so as Cellular data but it still not working can someone help me out plz 
"its racist. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEYconsidered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
I cant follow people following me. I cant follow people following me. Ive followed back numerous times & refreshed my data. There should be no cap on following someone back at the very least. I should have well over 10k by now
My true addiction. This is amazing I love it so much and the privacy is amazing 
Hai. Hey it is Lucy and I love tiktok but i wish everyone can be verified because that would be even more amazing even if your account is private thank u so much for reading this have the best day
ah yes app reviews. reviews by people with names such as cnnxcss9. Are you serious the review is literally trying to sell more info on the app saying that you can private your account and has a 5 star review. Ok boss men
Awesome app. This app is very entertaining and I love watching videos on it You should definitely download this app
"@cole_degagne TikTok. I really enjoy using Tik tok on my off time. You can learn so meany cool daily life hacks, or watch any sort of joke, project build, daily trends, WHATEVER you wanna watch, all at the swipe of your fingers Download it, whats there to loose"

"Tik tok. Honestly, I think tik tok is an amazing app to use. You can watch videos of your likings and make videos of your own, of cool things like biking or maybe cool hacks on your phone. It is a craving thing to watch, as you could watch it all day, some people think tik tok is bad, but I think it is very safe"
TikTok. Amazing app very addictive its incredible
"Issue. All my apps work fine when I turn data back on for them except tik tok keeps flicking off I deleted and redownloaded still no joy , been over 2 weeks I give up , but just letting ye know about problem "
Tiktok. TIKTOK IS SOOOO FUN WHEN THERE DRAMA IN MY PERSONAL LIVE I PUSH IT ALL AWAY AND GO ON TIKTOK ITS MY SECOND LIFE ITS FREAKING AMAZING
Me sonny. One of the best App.lots of good information
Amazing. This app is truly amazing ever since downloading it I feel a lot happier because people can watch me but cant hurt me. It really is incredible because you never have to go through any ads to watch something and if you dont like a video you can swipe and leave it. Also I can see what my friends are up to whilst they can see what I am up to. I rate this app five stars and would seriously recommend downloading
Sucks. Might as well be spied on by the cia
"Absolutely horrendous. First of all, TikTok is a breeding ground for pedophiles as there are young girls doing provocative moves everywhere. It encourages bad behaviour and is not a good way for anyone to interact with one another. The ads that were displayed on YouTube were another thing, I just watched an ad for TikTok which has 5 cases of the F word and 1 of the N word. Absolutely unacceptable especially as majority of the YouTube audience are kids. This is me signed in on a normal account with unchanged privacy and age restriction settings. Thank god its getting banned"
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible"
its meh. guidelines are more blind than a bat and pretty sure it sells ur data bc i got hacked on it
Go on Reddit Instead. Like any social media app that mines more data than BP drills for oil. It is designed to be incredibly addictive and potentially damaging mentally to the younger generations of society
Tick-tock is amazing. Absolutely love this app I just wish that smaller creators to be on the for you page because its hard for us to gain followers and get more likes when nobody even see the videos that awesome thank you for making this up but dont still my data I hate you but awesome love you thank you bye by the weigh out to all those small creators I watch it in a creepy way but I follow some movie and like your videos
Incredible. This app is AMAZING. I go on it everyday and its so fun to use and meet new people
Dont download. The Russians and Chinese are spying on you and YouTube shorts is better
My Favourite App. So thankful for an app that has brought me personal growth and experience. The opportunity to meet other amazing individuals. This app has so many amazing features. So glad to use my platform to spread love to those around the world thank you for allowing me to have the platform that I have Love spreading love. I am so grateful to connect with so many beautiful individuals on this app
Great app. Amazing support and personal project expansion support
The best. It is really fun to interact with friends and comment Im only private but I still like to watch friends tictoks
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid  Gorgeous Beautiful Deal breaker Fab Sexy Fandabbydosy Sickening Delicious Gr8"
"15 seconds of fame or flop Good luck. It feels so nice being connected to people around the globe over tiktok and social media. Tiktok is so easy to use and informative for life hacks and personal vocal opinion. Share your thoughts, experience, life, dance, love, and spontaneous channenges Fun for you #foryou @jamespaulson8#monkeybars #experience #life #dance #lovelife #tiktokqueen"
Me likey. My friends are all worried about getting the covid vaccine because they dont want to be microchipped and tracked wherever they go but they all have their phones with TikTok that they carry around everywhere
"Worst app extremely racist and inappropriate content. Second video I saw was extremely racist against African American people as it showed them a just a tool for farming. Then after that the next few video were inappropriately sexual and racist again.And the was no good content. The moderation is terrible and the app works over all bad , not to mention that the app is a data farm and gives your data and personal info to the Chinese government.This app is also a terrible influence on children which is its main user group. If you have it get rid of it now  Makes me sick to know that this app is alowed to even exist "
Tik tok is the best. I really enjo Tik tok its a great app is your under age then prob have your acc private so Yh my user on it is hana__spam. Have a nice day from Hana xx
"Great app, poor help. I have had tik tok for a while now, building up a decent following yet when I got a new phone it wouldnt let me log in and now I have no access to the account and everytime i go to reset the account it simply says unrecognised device. Even though I didnt have two factor authentication"
Awful. Chinese r stealing our data
"Unable to share videos to friends INSIDE app. Title. Not only that, Im not receiving ANY notifications at all outside the app, or inside the app, even though its turned on, both system and app notifications. Reinstalled and allowed all perms. Verified phone number. Cleared cache. Restarted phone. Tried on WiFi, and data only. And still unable to share videos WITHIN the app. Whats the point of this platform if you cant do just that? Kind of pointless to be honest"
Oof-. Please dont download tiktok it has cameras that spy
Im so done. Why is the Chinese spying on us Im so upset
Incredible. It is amazing and I totally recommend. You can be so creative and stylish and most of all it is a good way to hang out with your friends online so you should totally get this app
Incredible app. Its just such a good app and thats all I can say #tiktok
Amazing app. Best believe ya should download and if you do follow me on tiktok is alohababesarah. have a wonderful day people  tiktok is incredible

Tiktok app. Tiktok is such a amazing app download it and watch funny and entertaining videos
Educación. The best app to share information with family and friends
"Give me my live privileges. Banned me from going live for no reason, I wasnt showing my face(For privacy reasons) and my little 5 year old child talked and now I&#39;m banned from going live. I am 16+ when i try to add the ID and stuff to fix it and get my live privileges again, it doesnt work. I got 1000 followers for nothing"
Magnificent app. Tiktok is fun to use and very user friendly. I hear complaints but must be personal issues as I have no issue with Tik Tok
Amazing. I think this is a incredible app to make little videos and laugh at funny videos on home page.when I fist started using this app it was just life looking at all ur friends pots and all your favourite people.you can also text on this app
TikTok. I love TikTok I watch it 24 hours a day joking but it is the best app I have ever downloaded
"Haha men. Tiktok is like... instead of Mr Steal Yo man, tiktok is like  Mr Steal Yo Information"
I hate this app. Bad app u dont know who ur watching plus I doesnt like people download it so this is a filly bad app
"I love this but. I love tik tok but can you please give the playlist feature to personal accounts and give users the ability to edit existing videos like to change the thumbnail, hashtags, music and stuff so they dont have to delete the video  Aside from that I love it"
"AMAZING. Best app Ive ever used, best platform for everyone equally  love it. Thanks Tik tok  amazing Unreal Fantastic Marvellous Great Fabulous Terrific Incredible Splendid"
Terrible. Gave my data to advertisers and my phone started glitching after i got this appDo not get if u want ur phone to be alright
Signs me out randomly. I have two accounts on my tiktok app one for personal posts and another for school projects(video editing). And tiktok randomly signs me out of them and its annoying. Especially when logging in takes forever because of the sign in screen being so hard to navigate
Spy. Its a chinese spyware ap
Great. Its really good you watch 1 you will watch basically you whole fyp lol &lt;3 and it keeps you with info with stuff &lt;333
Amazing. Hi love this app you can find people that you like to watch you can make videos Im obsessed you should download
"Give me my live privileges. Banned me from going live for no reason, I wasnt showing my face (For privacy reasons) and my little 5 year old child talked and now I'm banned from going live. I am 16+ when i try to add the ID and stuff to fix it and get my live privileges again, it doesnt work. I got 1000 followers for nothing"
"I literally spend all day on TikTok . There are so many different videos to watch like DIY, craft, gym, life hacks, sports, outside, funny , animals and my favourite food Definitely recommend Have fun to creating videos for many to watch"
Omg. This is a scam the people who make it can take ur information and be u so dont get this scam (people are b*)

Good app but i need help. my fave app but i have 2 accounts my main and spam but now i cant get onto my main account as it says it needs updating ive tried both my email and phone number and says they are already in used so plz fix this problem
"Honestly such a funny app. Love the app, the content creators are incredible"
Terrible. If possible I would leave a .5 star review as they are a very scummy company in the way they sell data to add companies or the way the ban users for no reason
Stop stealing and selling ours and the information of F-KING MINORS ARE YOU SERIOUS. cheers
Great but. Great but I went on TIk tok to see that there was a Glich showing that there was no followers and stuff only to go into snap chat and see that people are hacking it getting ur IP address and then cancelling ur phone I have anxiety and I have gone into a mass panick please fix this quickly 
"Tik tok is a chinese spy app. Just like the confucius institute, this app is made by the chinese to spy on everyone"
"TikTok is SO entertaining, and fun to watch Download it pls and u wont regret it. Zara"
"It makes me suicidal. This app is true cancer. It is a parasite. It is the bubonic plague but worse. Its like the bubonic plague mutated a strain of cussing mental problem. It can only be cured by a genocide against all of the users of this app. I believe this is the anti-Christ. Burn everything that has seen or heard of this app, and all of the worlds problems would be solved. There would be peace on Earth. I hate this app. It also steals your personal data so theres that. Ps(buff miner)"

"Great. Hello,Im George and Im writing to tell you how amazing tik tok really is read on to find out more.Tik tok is a social sounds sharing app its fun and funny you can be tik tok famous or you can be a loner if your famous you have over 1000 followers and under your a loner but its great because if your the person who likes privacy you can turn it to a private account but if you dont care then you can share your vids to the whole world.I think the age ratings appropriate because there are a lot of swearing sounds and other people who swear so 13+ is appropriate.Other wise its a great app and I totally recommend it :D"
Its ok. I want info on how to send care packages to those still fighting the fight
"an amazing app. this app is amazing, I cant believe its free You can make videos and can get money You can also make videos up to 3minutes WOW Awesome Keep it up and start more updates:) THIS IS AND INCREDIBLE APP"
Its pretty good. I like titkok I spend on average at least 2 hrs of it each day I have been trying to watch less bc thats how addictive it is I mean it helps with hack tricks and fun and funny videos and conetent and dance stuff but it does affect u once u cant get off it and it effects u when u see hate comments and people who make u feel not good about ur self an or insecure about ur self I would recommend just keep track of what u like and skip the hate and try to not get addicted and still maintain a balance of irl social interactions and online social interactions thats all thanks tiktok 
CCP App. Use Instagram instead rather than the Chinese app which will spy on u
"I love it but. theres a thing called review filtered comments in the privacy settings, but when i go to view the comments it says unstable internet connection and i cant see what people have commented on my post. this is very annoying and its been going on for a long time now"

If this is because of my data or wifi, sorry about that. But if its because of the app, I would absolutely love it if you could fix this. Thank you for taking notice to read my feedback Ps I looooove the app"
"TikTok is the Best. TikTok was introduced to me by my teenage daughters during the beginning of lockdown, it has amused me, informed me like nothing has ever before and invited me, drawing out anger, confusion and fear at worseThe information gained through TikTok is a world wide education like I would have never accessed before or in my lifetimeDo not sell to the BigBoys or it will be controlled even more"
Yh. I think its amayzing but I dont reall like the new updates and I wish that we could do drafts with out the internet beucase I want to make videos outside without using my data
"China comin for u. China bad, make privacy go boom"
Beautiful. I downloaded it when it first came out it didnt have the app purchases then dont know about now Id hate to have to pay for an app where Im watching people really cool things to watch here anyways
"I love tiktok. There is something for everyone and any age. I cannot tell you enough how it has helped my situation; My brother died a year ago, and a while later I joined tiktok to find some calming short videos. Not only have I found comfort in other peoples words of hope and encouragement , Ive also learned so many great things cooking, exercise, drawing & painting, housekeeping, hacks, etc., to keep my mind occupied and busy since I joined. I am amazed to watch peoples creations and information and ideas from anywhere in the world, music, comedy, positive quotations the travel videos and peoples mental health stories  have helped me to cope with some of my bereavement issues and my anxiety  thank you  I love Tiktok "
"What an fun safe an amazing app. This app is so fun, and also has privacy settings so everyone can choose to be shown to the public. What I love the most about tik tok is how I make a video and I am able to add effects or dance to a song. I love looking through other videos for inspiration and I must say, it can be a little addictive but when I have a weekend with nothing to do I invite my friends over and we do tik toks"
That really good app. I love tiktok its a good app people work so hard to learn tiktok tricks it incredible
"Big Blackfoot. tik tok has valuable information, no negative comments, people, privacy tik tok is fun love creating and making videos"
"Good but needs work. Its fun and a good way to learn many good hacks and information about health or beauty But theres videos that have bad content in the kids electronics. The kids shouldnt see by their age it has to be more respectful because now days even 3,5 and above year old who are still kids they have this app so it has to at least not be bad influence in their eyes. I hope this is understood with clarity"
Loving it. I love it i be up all night just laughing and watching it U should download this app now
Get rid of the japenese pfp. TikTok please get rid of the Asian pfp they track you and they have the same bio please sort this out ASAP
Its amazing. It says u need to be over a serene age but u can but a thing on so u cant see some things its so fun u should definetly download it and your not aloud tell ur parent that u can put it on private so only the people u accept can see it
Best app out there. Best thing to watch all day. Especially losing track of time
"I love tiktok. There is something for everyone and any age.  I cannot tell you enough how it has helped my situation; My brother died a year ago, and a while later I joined tiktok to find some calming short videos. Not only have I found comfort inother peoples words of hope and encouragement , Ive also learned so many great things cooking, exercise, drawing & painting,  housekeeping, hacks, etc.,  to keep my mind occupied and busy since I joined. I am amazed to watch peoples creations and information and ideas from anywhere in the world, music, comedy, positive quotations the travel videos and peoples mental health stories  have helped me to cope with some of my bereavement issues and my anxiety  thank you  I love Tiktok "
So entertaining. Great app so much information from around the world
Tiktok. IncredibleHi I just updated my tiktok on my iPhone it lets me in for about 5 to 10 minutes then closes the app why is it doing that please fix it also tiktok is my life its incredible I cant keep off it
"So great . Hiii This Tik Tok app is really fun. I wish I had an account. But, I cant because Im only 9 years old lol. And its kinda confusing at times. I love this game so much All the Tik Tok people I watch is amazing I even found my YouTubers account (Sssniper wolf) And also Erin Williams. She is so nice and loves horses like me  She has an incredible seat on her horses. And I like Billy Eye-lish But she dosnt do much. I want to follow all those three people Tik tok is a-m-a-z-I-n-g  love all you Tik tokers"
Horrible application. This app is a waste of time and data. People often confuse this app for being funny which is a big misconception in my opinion. Theres just a few things repeating over and over and there comes a point when it makes you cringe and delete this app
Remove my phone number. Refuses to remove your private phone number
"This is really good app I  love it but there is scary things on there that scare kids. I love this but they can be blue whale,and old mans saying there really nice but in real there a 30 yr old I love that if u can someone hacks u then it would give u a notification what phone they using and u can sighn them out if no one has the phone there using,that u can block,but comments friended"
"Disgusting. The app picked up a conversation I had regarding my grandmothers death. My dad called to tell me she would be cremated. That same day a TikTok in my feed featured a man putting his grandmothers ashes into a coffee mug.  I had not googled, or searched, or commented anywhere online about cremation. Such an invasion of privacy and disgusting use of the algorithm"
This is a amazing app. This app is extraordinary. My personal favorite for parents is that if you dont want your childs or just anyones videos going public you can turn in private so only ur friends could see it if u want them to
"Amazing. TikTok is a really fun app to use and is kid-friendly when it needs to be. I learnt many new tricks for schoolwork and hacks from cleaning things to everything really. TikTok gives you other people around the world for you to communicate and have fun with TOGETHERI am in the Potterhead fandom and I have made many friends online. I definitely recommend this app however pls or young you are. If I could, Id rate this 1,000,000 stars "
"racist. theyre blocking hashtags and taking down videos relating to George Floyd and his unjustifiable murder, people are using this platform to share information and share their grief and anger about a poor man who was killed"
TikTok is good to watch. U should download it it good app guy
Get it. Download it if u want to lose track of time
It wont download. I tryed to download it and it said put a password in for my billing information? Why
Fix this one thing and then Ill Re download. ADD THE FEATURE TO RESTRICT WHO TAGS YOU TO FRIENDS ONLY OPTION OR EVERYONE OR ONLY ME. Im tired of spams of being told I won an iPhone 13 or 13 pro with link in bios and a link that hacks your account
Best app in a long time. Best app in a long time. Better than vine in my opinion The range on content you can watch is incredible
"Really good app. The app is really good. I enjoy making and watching TikToks. However I do have an inquiry, my dark mode doesn&#39;t turn on whilst using the app meaning the personal profile page is white. How can I fix this? Other than that the app is fab"
My Favourite App. So thankful for an app that has brought me personal growth and experience. The opportunity to meet other amazing individuals. This app has so many amazing features. So glad to use my platform to spread love to those around the world thank you for allowing me to have the platform that I have Love spreading love. I am so grateful to connect with so many beautiful individuals on this app Thankful for a place to have a voice

First of all its basically just a bunch of girls and guys with there shirts offJust soft porn accessible for kidsAnd secondly its a huge waste of time and will ruin your attention spanOn a more personal note I hate tik tok because it ruins songs that I like and even artist and its just Everywhere and I hate it
The best. Tik Tok is the best app I join this year it helped me get over a lot of personal things and I could never be more proud of myself. I promise if you join you wont regret it
Spyware do not download. It has been exposed as spy ware watching everything you type outside of the app
Tik tok on top. I looooovvvveee this app I use most of my data on this
WORST APP EVER. So when I downloaded this app it was promising to me so then when I went inside it asked personal stuff to my and I was confused about it but later it was gone sooooooo like maybe a glitch but it keeps lagging me out
"AMAZING. I wasnt too sure about this app at first I thought it was all challenges and random videos, but I LOVE it this app is so much more than that there are so many incredible channels dedicated to body positivity, there are so many channels just posting funny videos to make you laugh too, I love it and I probably have a Tik Tok addiction  but I would highly recommend this App, its easy to use too and I love it "
Mę. Its my favorite app because 1. You can watch funny videos 2. You can watch hacks
Great. It&#39;s great love the songs and Its the best app to ever exist and should get an award for how INCREDIBLE this app truly is
"TikTok is awesome. I love TikTok its so amazing and fun to be on There are so many funny, cool, satisfying videos to watch and you can make your own They have great privacy and even family paring so if your scared to put your child on TikTok because of creeps dont worry you can put family paring on in settings I hope you can get TikTok to experience the fun Im having on it"
"Glitching. Ever since the new update the app has been a real nightmare. Comments wont load, tells me randomly that Im going too fast and notifications wont load no matter if Im using data or wifi. Bit annoying"
Ching chon china is spying on you. china is spying on you
TikTok is the best app. Very good app 10/10 must download and watch again

Well I used to have it then this happend. I deleted the app a couple of years ago and now iTunes won&#39;t let me download tik took again. But I think that&#39;s a personal problem.. This app (well when I used to have it) it was amazing I really recommend this app for you
Spying on us. china china china china china china china china
"Great app but hard to get recognition. Hi, I really like TikTok and have been using it for a few years. It lets me entertain myself while also being able to express my emotions and work. However, Ive noticed many artists on TikTok barely getting any of the recognition they deserve. I believe that TikTok should focus more on showing art videos than videos of people doing things that took barely any time. This used to not be a bug problem, but ive noticed it on my fyp along from personal experience"
"AMAZING I MEAN AMAZING. I love this app this app, i highly recommend getting it you can do loads of fun effects and you can also watch your friends tik toks. In my personal opinion its wayyyyy better that music.ally Im sorry but it is. I dont think you could even give any moee upgrades to itThis app is very addicting"
"Amazing app. Such a good app, I love it so much. Its so fun and theres so much things to do on it.Some ppl say that they spy on u from ur camera but irc"
Incredible. This app is amazing I just started doing my own tik tok account like 2 months ago and I blew up I got 1k likes in 2 months you should definitely get this app and start filming
"Enjoyment. Hi Darlings Enjoying being with my TikTok familia I just have one question. What is artificial engagement??? Looking forward to hearing from you.

"Incredible. This app is absolutely amazing I love it so much, and its so much fun. If your looking to have a laugh, or enjoying learning dances, pranks, animals, drama, any of those, download Tik tok No complaints at all, and one of the best apps ever Good job Tik tok"
"Amazing app. Such a good app, I love it so much. Its so fun and theres so much things to do on it.Some ppl say that they spy on u from ur camera but idk"
Amazing app. I love this app so much I have nothing bad at all to say about it just an overall incredible app well done developer
Its good. Its good but Ive noticed that I cant see my own favourites and cant put any videos into my favourites. Also cant repost videos due to tik tok and for my privacy and cant change it and its really annoying help lol
Good app. So i downloaded this about 2 years ago but it is such a great app and i still watch it +_+
Absolutely Incredible. This app is the best Make sure your over the age of 12 though as some content may be appropriate. But its still amazing and sooo addicting
Best replacement of vine. I love this app. I feel like they accommodate my personal interest. It always keeps me entertained. Very pleased with TikTok
Hacking. i have been told that the chinese people are hacking into our phones and stealing our information and data. is this true?
Tik Tok. I love this app it is SO easy to lose track of time on this app. I have spent HOURS on this app
Best Ap ever. Love it This ap couldnt be any better. Tik Tok is amazing in every single way shape and form and the people who think otherwise have no idea what they are talking about. Tik tok is no different than Facebook and Twitter with regard to data security and its WAY more enjoyable
Amazing. This app is amazing it has literally taken over my life with all the dances and IM IN THE GETTO stuff  and because you can make your own Tik toks it is incredible 
TIK TOK IS DA BEST. TikTok is a really good app also there is many funny videos there are many Support vids for NHS there are many life hacks and lots of. Nice music also u can make ur on vids and post it or u can keep it on private make sure to make an acc first TIK TOK DA BEST
"Amazing App but something to add. I love this app it is amazing and I love the fact you can do fun dances and make a shoe look like a car and there is great comedy with cool filters There is just one thing I would add though to make this app more appropriate for someone at a younger age as I know my little brother ends up watching them. Firstly I want to say that there are some people on Tik Tok that do wrong stuff and then a kid my brothers age sees it. When Im scrolling on the fyp to see all the trends and that I come across stuff I really wish I never saw. There is a button of to hold the screen down that makes it so you dont ever see that video again, but I think there should be in the privacy section be a button were you put in your age so you dont see bad things. I do hope that this doesnt make anyone not get this app, because Im going to be honest, if this was added could be for many ages"
"My review on this amazing app. So I have been on this app since it was musically and I have enjoyed being on this app every second, I have made loads of new friends and I am looking forward to what is next for this incredible app"
"I love it just. Im pretty young like I guess a tween and there is a lot of hate in comments also a lot of videos swears in them also same with people that are perverts because they can comment on videos of young children and just say u are so beautiful here is my number (lets say it was there) and then they would freak out,so on....there is also people that can hack(just like everyone of the apps) but these ones get very personal so I dont think u guys can help with this just needed to say it but still love the app it is great "
Malware. This is a Chinese spy app - DO NOT DOWNLOAD
It is Chinese SPY-WARE. If u didnt know. TIL Tom is getting banned because the Chinese government is watching you 
problem. There is a problem where I go to my account page and see no followers&amp;likes and in my notification centre there is no notifications even tho I get a lot each day. They keep saying check networkBut mines all fine every other app works am I being hacked??
"Idea for improvement. This app is AMAZING although I have a ton of videos liked and saved. I would like a feature thatll allow me to organize the videos in like albums/folders or something. Theres a ton of life hacks, dances, humour etc that Id like to save but organize.Also, Id like my friends only post separated with my public post, just like my privates. Can you make it have to he option of it being separated and non separated, maybe some people dont want it separated, thats why. Just little improvement Id want. "
Tiktok. I love the videos on this but can you keep track of what we late watched thank you
"Newest update with notifications is horrible. My notifications are FILLED of random people replying with a video to a comment you liked. This isnt a feature, just spam. Youve GOT to take this feature out or at least let us disable it"
"My review on this amazing app. So I have been on this app since it was musically and I have enjoyed being on this app every second, I have made loads of new friends and I am looking forward to what is next for this incredible app also I enjoy making content for people to laugh enjoy and relate too"
Brain wash application. Diverts youth on wrong way for only showing others privacy
Not download this game. So first of all to not donowald the app I mean is because u will become hacked by the Chinese government andddd u will see naked ppl and umm u wouldnt want to see that and also THTERE IS RACISOM IN THE APP BLACK LIVES MATTER 
Communists fake news spreader. Fake news and stolen datas . Always push ( force )unwanted medias
"Quality memes. Very swag, I wish privacy was better"
"bad. listen to orang man, dont download, this app spies on you. get reddit"
"4 star rating. I absolutely injoy this app, its a good way to connect with some of my friends and I love using this app also to help give me some tips and hacks for cooking and even more overall my experience was good Im addicted to it and so are a lot of people lol definitely recommended"
Awesome. So much fun and helped me with my depression. Only concern is that it tracks my ever move even when not on tik tok but the actual app is the best
Its fun. Its cool but there has been a LOT of hacks on it so Ive deleted it and Im not sure if I should download it again. It also swears. I like it but be careful people could hack you
"Great App For Time Passing. If You Bored, Watch TikTokGreat App To Pass TimeBut Does Get a Bit Too AddictiveWarning. Make Sure You Have Enough Mobile Data. Use WiFi is the Best Way To Save Data"
Worst app ever. App is anti black and spies on you
"Amazing Download Now. Tik Tok its an amazing app because you can make short vids and upload them for the whole world to see You can make new trends and even follow trends Talking about following, you can follow the people you like and even like their videos. Its really fun and I will rate it 5 stars because it&#39;s just so fun Also, you can talk to the people you like by commenting on their videos. There is also cool dances, memes, music, life hacks, tutorials and so much more So if I have to sum Tik Tok in one sentence I would say, An awesome app you can make videos on. Download it nowReview By: Nicole Freeman, aged 11"
Annoying besides the memes. Im a 13 year oldI used this app briefly and all I found were annoying videos of trashy dancesIts music.ly by amplified cringe This app great purely for the memesChina please keep stealing the data Cuz I wanna see this app die
Horrible and addicting. It has stolen my sisters and they refuse to do anything else
Worst invention. The platform not only is just a bunch of dances but it takes steals information
Ew. Steals your info Ive heard plus people are showing boners :/
TikTok is incredible. Hi just to say TikTok is th wheat app ever and I love it so much thank you for
"This app is amazing    Been on it for 3 years. The app is incredible, its so fun and you can grow your platform by doing trends. the dances are so fun and as an ex dancer they keep up my skills, you can have a lot of fun or you can take it seriously definitely get this app The best thing is its FREE Try it out"
"Scary,terrible. Pls guys watch out I think tick tock hacked my phone cuz not the is a recording dot in the corner of my screen even on my photos Tick tock pls explain now"
"Funtabulous TikTok App. TikTok app offers effects to improve your videos. My personal favorite is the TV on and TV off effect. Music and sounds can be added to your video. The duet feature is gold. In my opinion, Duet increases your chance of going viral. Children under 11 or so should probably be supervised or not allowed to use at all. You can message other members if you have a phone number. Looking forward to seeing everyones creations. Have fun ....GO"
Spy on you. China
"Suggestion. Hey I think it would be cool if you could batch delete or at least be able to private all your videos in one fell swoop, its a little annoying when you want to restart your account and having to remove all your videos one but one"
Great. It has many of your interest it also looks into what videos do you like and watch videos you watch and it put it on your for you page the private account is also amazing for someone under 16
My review. Its brilliant but it only works outside of my house and it wastes my data on my phone. Why cant it work in my house?
Most useless. Complete waste of time and data is anyways going to China
Tik tok queen. Hi I love this so much you can let your self be free on this app really recommend it has lil themes like Halloween Easter Christmas birthday and it no judgement and hard safety procedures private your account limit your followers and comments so yeah no problem so download it yeah hope this info really helps make your decision if you do come and find me on @love2dance3_29 I have blonde hair and blew eyes byeeeeee
"Hella disappointing. I thought musically upgrading to tiktok was going to be better. It was all about making fun little dances when it was musically. Nothing more. Now its just more and more random stuff everyday. Dont get me wrong, so much people have incredible talent, all though so much inappropriate content gets exposed to young audiences. The unnecessary drama that keeps going on eternally. Its just too much. So many harmless tiktoks are taken down while others who are very inappropriate stay there as if they were completely normal. Dances cant just be normal. Of course not, they need to have these sexual moves like the throwback. Then I see children in my family doing those  idiotic moves? Hell no. And to top it off I learn that Im being watched by the Chinese government?? Are you seriously kidding me. What next? For an app thats famous like tiktok, it needs a whole lot more of improvements because its just unacceptable as it is right now. I have a whole lot more arguments but writing then down would just be too long. Anyways, the overall experience isnt even a star"
"10/10. Great for if you want the Chinese spying on you, otherwise I wouldnt download it again, ever"
"Really good app but exasperating glitch. Now I may seem a bit unfair by writing about a small glitch, but I am only writing this so that (hopefully) the developer gets back to me and helps me with it. Over all, this is a really really good app It doesnt have too much inappropriate stuff and you can make really cool music videos. My only problem is that, when I try to add text to the video, it sometimes glitches and the thing I wrote stays in the middle of the screen and you cant move it or delete it. Then a different bit text I wrote for that video goes extremely large and you cant change it either. Other than that, this is a brilliant app. Their age rating is good but I say that parents should look into it if their child is slightly underage but still wants it. Look up the rules and privacy settings and consider your childs responsibility. You can have a private account or a public one and you can change your username or profile photo I certainly recommend it, especially if youre into the trends or filmmaking.I would really appreciate it if the developer could get back to me sometime as I often write reviews for apps and nothing happens. No hurry though, Im sure its a busy lifeMany thanks,A TikTok user"
"Please delete the bots. My friends told me there are sexual hook up bots on TikTok. They also told me that they are not sexual hook ups they are trying to get your info and sell it please TikTok delete them,thank you"
Love this app. Tik tok reminds you people are incredible
Really good. Good privacy settings and I like the new update. I wouldnt recommend for under 13s but its really good and fun
"It is incredible Ive got too too many words to describe this amazing app xxxx. Incredible,amazing,AND INSPIRING ITS AMAZINGGGGG"
"Love. Its my favorite passing time app. So many videos. From funny, to information, conspiracies, diys, new music. Anything really"
happy parent. this app is so amazing even if there can be some inappropriate stuff there is so many types of videos you can watch download now
Why spy on us. Why do you guys need to spy on us exactly??
Incredible. How on earth do you not already have this app
"CarryMinati. This app is instigating youth to stay jobless and do nothing but dance infront of phone. People are exposing their lives, there isnt any kind of privacy in families . Pregnant women (eg Khushi Punjaban) is risking their preganancy just to damce infront of camera. It is very misleading app. People are spreading Fake news through this app. Todays youth is only confined to likes and followers"
"Chinese spying company. Pure evil, and narcissistic"
Outstanding. Really addictive app that allows you to lose track of time (its literally time travel)I enjoy this app so much and I think it definitely deserves 5 starsThank you tik tok
"a few issues. tik tok is a great and fun app, i deleted it for a few days and re-downloaded it but once i did all my drafts were gone. i have totally lost all my memories with my sister, dad and the rest of my family, i didnt post them as they were personal to me but now theyre gone forever, i wish tik tok had a way to restore them because now im utterly heart broken"
"Everyone has there options. Personally, I use TikTok a lot, TikTok I see new cool things,(life hacks, crafts, ect..). But sometimes there is a lot of judgment in little or large creators, such as little hutty for example. I would recommend it but again everyone has there options. There is also people who judge colour, so"
Used to love it. Listen I like it but...its getting really dangerous and unsafe its a great app and I like the funny videos but all the drama happening is just nah and stealing information Im sorry but I cant have yall going through my phone it was a great up but now its the worst sorry not sorry
"My personal opinion on the app Tik Tok. Good app, funny and exiting to use, as in watching videos and making videos but I cant give 5 stars as nothing is perfect"
Cringe. Garbage China steels private Information
Chinese Hackers. They spy on you
"Phuck you China. My name is Neo, world renowned hacker and I have come to warn of the impending doom. China is taking information of teenage girls and adding to data files, this is bad because when China eventually takes over the world, they will know whos a stupid Tik Tok ho and whos not a stupid tik tok ho. DELETE THIS NOW WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCEYours sincerely Neo"
Good way to pass time. This app was downloaded just to see what my kids though was so funny. But I have really in joyed watching and making videos
Incredible. This is the best app i have ever downloaded. Be careful though because you can get addicted and loose track of time. I recommend you get this app just make sure you keep an eye on the clock because once i was on it all night and didnt even realise it . This app can make you laugh and cry at the same time. I have nothing negative to say about this app. This app will change your life all i find myself doing in class is doing tiktok dances 
"reddit gang. Nice job Chinese government, storing data on mindless kids who lost their creativity"
TikTok. This app his amazing I watched it for hours and hours Ive learned so much and its so fun to watch and learn so download the app to have the bests day ever its an motivation app where you can watch your friends dance of do any kind of vidoes and its not even taht hard to film DOWNLOADED NOW TO GET TO EXPERIENCE THE FUN :))
Dont get tik tok. Tik tok is a app that can track ur location and has access to ur camera at all times tik tok can look at ur camera and see what ur doing all the time and has access to ur mic at all times as well dont get tik tok its not all fun and games it is very racist and inappropriate it may be addicting but dint get urself into it
Tik tok inspiration. I love tik tok I mean I am ADDICTED to tik tok but when I deleted TikTok it discarded all of my drafts and I knew it was going to do that but I actually offloaded it.Whixh is when it deletes but it saves the data.Now i am sitting here crying because I had so much memories.Not trying to bash you guys but you should fix that
THIS IS THE BESTTTT. I literally love this app I watch it all the time and it has some good learning videos on it to like baking crafts. And I find it really funny you should definitely download it
Videos removed. Why is your software removing my videos of myself as a passenger in a drift car on a closed race track that we have paid a full weekend to be at? There is absolutely no illegal or offensive activity happening in the video or in my description. I e appealed both times and you refuse to for me any reason why these videos are being removed? Ive read you community guidelines 3 times in full. What gives? I wont hold my breath for a response
Entertaining. This app is very fun and entertaining but you can lose track off time if you use it too much and bear in mind Im a 10 year old kid
Great Creative Engaging Application. Thank you so much for creating this amazing application we creators enjoy & entertain a lot very nice engagement maintained by this app among people But want to get more engagement for my personal creative creators cant get more views but funny lame creators are sometimes getting more popularity than creative people so take care about this tiktok id : @ashikrehmankhan boost & checkout this one kindly
"Love it but. I was on this app since musically but I have to say I absolutely love love love TikTok Plus happy 1year anniversary The only broblemmo is that you cant post or look at videos without data or WiFi other than that its awesome(update 1 yr later) TikTok has improved much, yet I still think musically was more family friendly as little children have started to use the app keep up the good updates and work "
Data collection of children. This crooked Chinese company collects data on everyone but most notably children. How dare these scum bags do that
"The best app ever. This is an incredible app, I love it So entertaining and funny. Long live tik tok "
Want to go viral. And incredible app that allows you to impact avast audience worldwide really exceeds my expectations

I love tiktok. I love tiktok it is really fun to make videos and watch cool stunts or dances or hacks etc it is really easy to lose track of time.  I love it
"Good. Is good, funny memes, 10/10 would download again, pls no China man hack my account tho"
Its made by Ching Chong China. I HATE TIK TOK BECAUSE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SEARCH UP ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE DETAILS AND HACK YOU BANK ACCOUNT AND OTHER STUFF.SHAME ON CHINA
"Cathartic App. With just the right mix of silly humour, dancing, lip syncing, live music and personal journeys shared, this TikTok app is proving to be very cathartic. Thank you "
Tiktok. I love this app so much its incredible I love all the sounds but its swears but that doesnt matter

Incredible app. Ive never seen a more supportive community on an app. Its honestly inspiring Tik tok is truly more than what meets the eye
SELL. Please sell to Microsoft so I can download again :(

"Great. This app is so good Can find funny videos, dumb ones ,pranks,dancing and its so easy to get popular This is one of those apps where if youre so bored you can go on this thinking youll be on for ten mins and come off 3 hours later. It doesnt seems so entertaining but once youre scrolling you cant stop Only problem is its so entertaining and fun you can lose track of time and sleep"
TikTok. When I first groined TikTok I didnt have a lot and I downloaded as a joke but now Im addicted to it. Its really funny and sometimes sad lots of people make TikToks and I love them because there unique and personal something and funny
The most incredible app for content creators. 5 stars
"Why tik tok is good. It helps you find hacks for food and more You can create your own videos and trends Download tik tok , where the trends start"
Not letting me do anything. I made a new account and now i can not search anything or follow any accounts all I can do is watch and like videos. If there is any feedback please help
I wanna be able to duet T^T. It a nice app with a lot of hate but tell me how to get out of tik tok privacy thingy for duetting
"An Incredible Journey. I can honestly say that this app has a way of being people together that i have not seen anywhere else. People of all races, age, and gender can find commonality here. Really something to experience"
"Great App. Great for learning multiple information; business, cooking, law, DIY, my personal favorite anime, best app of the century in my opinion"
TikTok. Amazing Incredible The best app ever Entertaining
Direct messages arent showing up. I love the app its fun but when my friends want to send me a message it says my privacy settings are on and when i go into my settings to turn the direct messages on it doesnt show up. I also looked through help centre to get it working but it only showed me how to get them. Thanks for youre attention and hope that direct messages for my iPad and phone start working
It very good. It is very fun and when you are sad and you watch this you will laugh so much very good app should definitely download 
Tik Tok. I love love love this amazing incredible and inspiring app It has amazing features and superb quality and allows people to contact their friends I LOVE THIS APPPPPPP
messed up. Has videos of literal animal abuse and has an extremely toxic and dangerous community that ruins creators lives and even promotes harm. Also steals data not to mention the censorship of the lord and saviour big chungus
"PLEASE READ. -hey This is a amazing app You get to be creative and see what other people like :D but if you get addicted easily,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP Youre personality can change"
Communist pigs. Get off anyones personal device
Love it. Thoroughly enjoying it. However I do believe there should be a age restriction and I really do not like seeing pictures of peoples dead babies. Thats a personal thing and personally it shouldnt be on TikTok
Great app. Great app to get a laugh or information
"Racist, islamaphobic, privacy. Racist and islamaphobic was they constantly delete or block users from posting about the concentration camps, talking about the police brutality against black people and also collects data without you knowing"
This app has me laFFing so hard. Sometimes I lose track of time
"Best app. Tik tok has been really revolutionary in people, who never thought they were creators, they are now making incredible content for everyone to enjoy"
TikTok. TikTok is a amazing app you can do anything you want on it you can dance sing cool draw volgs DIYs anything people can like your. Videos follow you comment on your vid but if you dont want people to see your videos you can draft them or have a private Account its the best app EVER. Download NOW
TikTok is so Fun and love too watch videos . Hey hope y help you with your problems 
TIKTOK IS INCREDIBLE. Omg tiktok is my happy place and I just love it so much it makes me so happy everyday and I couldnt physically live without the amazing world of tiktok Ive learnt so many life hacks and made so many friends for life and the dances keep me active so Im basically running on tiktok to be healthy. I love tiktok SO MUCH THANK YIU FOR MAKING THIS BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL UNREAL EXTRAORDINARY APP 
tik tok. can skip adverts and click not interested to not show any more of that video. u can set privacy settings to do with swearing and things like that i really recommend tik tok its so amazing
"Newest Update (03/11/2021). I recently transferred the app itself and the data with it over to a new phone and I have lost all of my categories in favourites and the ability to categorise favourites, something which is obviously incredibly annoying. I can see through apps such as Reddit that many other people have had the same problem and it would be very pleasing if this could be fixed as I personally enjoyed having the ability to categorise everything and it was something which made the app better for me and I would really appreciate it if this could be moved"
"I have a suggestion. TikTok is a great app and I use it everyday. I have a suggestion about likes and comments. Likes from comments should be included in the overall total of likes you have.Also, when you go to look at a sound and it says original, could we have an Original tag for the person who created a dance (if there is one).Next, please track the age we put in TikTok because I am 16 now and I really want to go liveLastly, TikTok should have a place to get you own sounds from videos you have got in your album so you can use it for a video.Please respond"
Love it lets all get hacked and possibly bombed. YAY YAY CHINESE SPY WEAR
great just not the recent updates. Its a really good app and I highly recommend it Ive seen a bunch of incredible videos but omg the updates. REPLYING TO A RANDOM COMMENT ON A VIDEO THATS NOT YOUR OWN WITH A VIDEO? TF? comments just look ugly now
dont get this app. by making videos short they get addictive and when they are short they get addictive and you lose track of time and they are using this trick to make people use it more often. which creates an unhealthy addiction
"Tik Tok is an incredible app, but maybe some new suggestions or ideas .  Tik Tok, is an amazing app, when I have a bad mood and feeling a little upset, tik Tok always makes me feel so much better, it gives me a lot of joy and relief some stress. I made a lot of great friends in tik tok which is quite nice  and tik Tok can also help everyone for ideas for something like tricks/hacks for people to learn which is helpful, but maybe some ideas to make it a bit better, perhaps you can maybe decrease limits on comments so people can type more because sometimes it can be a little frustrating but its still alright overall  Also can you maybe try do something about this, sometimes when people block someone from being around their accounts the other person go making fake accounts to look at accounts still which is quite a unpleasantness. Still Tik Tok is a wonderful app and I would recommend you to download it, Ciao  "
"Tiktok and Dopamine. This app creates an easy to use, user oriented, personal algorithm which allows the user to mostly see videos that cause them to release dopamine. A very large amount of children between the ages of 9-12 as well as teenagers 13-19 are largely addicted to the app. During the key periods of brain and character development a person should have regulated dopamine levels. Tiktok not only deregulates but derail the dopamine balance. Save the children of the future. 369"
"Best app ever. I love this app I love that you can make videos feel free and explore awesome techniques that you have never knew on TikTok before like awesome hacks, if you are a noob at TikTok or bored find new trends and memes. Thanks for making this app. I just have one question. Was this app Music.lly before TikTok?Thats all I have. Thanks"
Update. Hey TikTok For some reason it wont update my TikTok to the latest build and I cant access certain things which kinda bugs me out especially because I could use it for special reasons and yeah
Its so stupid change it BACK. I like the old one and u should have a no pass word thing AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT BC CHINA IS WATCHING U AND SPYING ON YOU SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT OR U WILL BE SPYED ON BY CHINA
"INCREDIBLE, 100% RECOMMEND. TikTok is so addictive and fun, if u have nothing to do then I guarantee u will love TikTok, there is a mixture of different dances and trends that u can do, so there is something for everyone which makes this app that little bit more SPECIAL Honestly, I fully recommend this app"
I adore it. Its a fun thing to watch when ur in bed or bored however u always get banned for silly reasons but overall its amazing to make tiktoks amazing to watch tiktoks and incredible to have an acc on TikTok
Woke individuals. Loving all the like minded individuals Ive found on this site (that took me awhile to join thnxs to my gf who joined & shared info &  s w/me from this site). Has it been sold to an  as previous POTUS suggested & is why its still accessible to us ? Either way still  the site
5/5. this is the best app you can make videos and make it public or private if your shy (also you can get money from just making short videos )(download this now)
"I refused. Look, I refused to get this app because I still thought it was some dancy mouth acting stupid app. I joined because I thought I had to to watch a video my friend sent me listen, nothing can every EVER replace vine, but this is close enough. Your algorithm is very well matched, and theres some great videos. The only issue is that o can easily watch videos for 6 hours and forget I need to sleep"
Just incredible. It is an amazing app and if you put work on you really do get rewarded. In a week I was able to get to 35k followers and I would definitely recommend. One negative is that is is very addictive
"New notification interface hard to read/track. However notifications/alerts have been updated make it really hard to track. I miss comments and replies because of the way theyre displayed, and by the time I see them its too late to respond as its irrelevant. I wish it would go back to the old way. I have tried getting adjusted to the new version and havent been able to, so Im losing interest in checking  my replies/the app"
Im am tik tok addict. I am really addicted to tik tok its just such an incredible app to spend your time on The only thing I wish to happen is for me to get * tik tok famous*  Tiktok is my favorite app since you can do dances and do story time and sooo much more I just LOVE  TIK TOK 
"Yep, its still enjoyable. So, the app calculates what you want to see based on how many full videos you watch and how many times you watch them as well as what you like and follow, but, its easy to throw off the algorithm if you want. Ive seen so much more of the world, so many different types of people, and found so many useful life hacks since i have joined Love this app"
Top App 2020. Full entertainment and good information. The best app of 2021
so I wouldnt. Love it but the Chinese people who run this are sterling your information and using  it on other websites so I wouldnt download it
Wifi problem. My tiktok is not working its saying I have a wifi issue but all of my others apps are working I also have tried with data but still doesnt work
I love tik tok. I love TikTok because its so entertaining and fun I can post fun things and show my personal life and the events in my life with friends and family that I love
Very bad. Dey did be spying on meh
Incredible . This app is were I spend most of my time it is a creative and amazing app 1000% recommended
Cool but not really my type. This is what is wrong I dont know how to make a tic tok and it might hack you when you put in your phone number and iPad number its kinda cool but its not my type my sis said she got hacked when she put in her phone number and her iPad number in then I said it will be alright then I said I will do a review and here it is sis Hope you are happy now you are the best sis that is why I wrote this review just for you I love you so much stay safe stay home stay strong =D
amazing. i love the app and all the incredible videos which can keep you entertained for hours
Love it. I love it just dont sell my information to the Chinese
"Incredible. I have been using this app for a long time now (3 years) and I still love it You can never loose interest in all the trending sounds The sercurity is absolutely amazing + the best dances to learn. I know some people that think this app is rubbish ,but when you get to know it, you love it like me. I think the rating should always be 5 star :)"
I lost my account. My account password have been hacked and linked with a new email I was lie_star with a picture of lynx from Fortnite but I forgot to link my emailplease help
creepy. Stop tracking me Chinese government
"I updated and it had so many Musically features. I was so stuck because I updated the app and all of the sounds in the app were from 2017 like the greatest showman songs etc. I still cant change the profile picture, change privacy settings, comment, share, use hashtags, use drafts or private videos, follow anyone, and more. Please help me out"
Great Entertainment. Glad I downloaded this AppYou can get stuck watching videos for hours There is a huge variety of content to watch for just about all ages. I record and download my own vids(Follow me LuvNailsNicole:) I Definitely recommend downloading
The best tt. Hey yall I rlly love dat yall made tiktok bc I can post thing & in I can put thing in my private & I can also graft
Good buy. Good but is probably spy ing on you
Great app. Highly recommend you download this incredible app today
Spies on me. Dont trust this it watches u
Amazing. Theres amazing life hacks dances and comedy it is a great thing to do when bored there is also amazing TikTok stars that create all the dances in their spare time this app is a great entertainment app to cure your boredom I would recommend to keep your account on private if you are wearing a work or school uniform in your videos but that is it I love this app it helped me find my idle Addison Rae easterling
"Tik tok. Dear TikTok , this is a very good app it has inspiring videos and tons of fun , but theres one problem that please can you fix there are bots and they track down where you live using this link in their bio and it really creeps me out - I havent been able to sleep in weeks"
Such a bad app. 1. Tik Tok is very  unsuitable for many ages it also takes up data and personal information which other people can see2. People Are creating such dumb videos and me on the other hand I post loads of videos and get hate it is such an Inappropriate game and very dangerous  3.Tik Tok is very dangerous and some videos can lead to very serious damage and morons like the people who created this need to think this though  So I hopes that this helped when youre going to install another game kind regards Poppie
Fun and entertaining. Super fun and entertaining to watch. I wish there werent ads but Im glad you have the option to scroll past them. I lose track of time while on this app
"Glitches. I dont know what has been going on with my TikTok but every time I open the app I can get through maybe, maybe three videos before they freeze and wont load. My Wi-Fi works in my 5G data works. Im having trouble understanding why Ive been on TikTok for two years now, and Ive never had this many problems it really makes me want to delete the app"
Too good. You can literally watch anything from dances to life hack and food tricks. Anyone can watch TikTok it has anything for anyone
"Boring and the same. After you watch a couple of videos you just see people re posting the same stuff and most of the people are rude and toxic they all spam  and i usually see racist videos. I also find the fact that there is a lot of accounts with grown ups not posting just watching very disturbing, I recommend not getting this"
Best app. Best app any time and any where do you want to watch but just get rid of the people who do weird stuff
Either owned by Bill Gates or China. Not worth giving up your data. Simple as
Repost option disappeared. Great overall but the repost option disappeared. I can no longer repost videos or see the reposts of my friends. The option to turn on and off the repost feature also disappeared from the privacy settings
"Lags Really Bad. Please fix the lagging when people are live and their words dont match their lips. Consistently buffering as well. Shutting WiFi off going off of cellular data doesnt help. Clearing the cache, closing the app and rebooting phone does not make it any better. Please fix this major issue with the app"
TikTok review. I think that TikTok is a great place to go to when your having a bad day or your just bored but be careful not to watch it for too long cause you can really lose track of time
Best. Tik Tok is the best app ever. I stay up losing track of time at time watching Tik tok because it the best app for everyone
"Trash. Im glad tik tok is going to be band. My family told me its from China and they take our data and show it to the world. If you want any thing better than tik tok, then download Clash video Thanks for reading. Byeeee "
The best information and fun facts for your enjoyment. Long videos have been greatly appreciated
"Why so many meaningless notifications?. Especially: I do not need a notification anytime I comment with a question mark. This notification has no business telling me I asked a good question. How thick are you? The user can see I commented & choose to reply and discuss at will. All youre doing here is logging a meaningless interaction to sell that data created by me clicking ignore on yet another meaningless notification.I need to see likes, dms, and comments. Thats it. You dont need to send me a notification bc I used a question mark"
Love TikTok. Great app- no glitches Look up any subject & find posting & information in seconds. You are the driver. Its the best
"This is the most amazing app ever. Its so fun, entertaining and bring happiness and sometimes a bit of sadness I spend hours on the app  I have met incredible people and people who have supported me and lots more"
"Ordered Never Arrived. I ordered 3 wigs from this company December 9, 2021 and I have not received anything. They sent me three different tracking numbers with three different carriers. I get the exact same email saying my order has been shipped. There is no phone number to call, no chat to speak with anyone and no way to actually track your orders. I am not working with the attorney general to see what can be done so this wont happen to anyone else"
Hehfnbxnfhcjrbhdhrhhd. It is a very good But sometimes it is bad if you have your darter on because it will steal your data so turn your data off 
Best app I ever had. I love it simple download it and watch you will love it to its so addicting
New update. As of the 31st if March) The new update did something weird to my Tik Tok its glitches and wont work it acts as if I dont have internet/data when I do Ive tested it with other apps and websites and my internet is fine its just the app that is glitching out pls fix this
One of my favorite app. Being on tictoc relief my stress I enjoy it very much thank u this was a very incredible though I am grateful thank u
"TikTok. I love TikTok. Full of fun videos to watch by tons of different kinds of creators. Fun for the whole family TikTok has taught me so much Hacks, tricks, tips, information Ive never known before TikTok is one of the best apps Ive downloaded and I couldnt be more happy"
INCREDIBLE. I love this app so much
Nope. The creators of tick tock is using the app to spy
How to get followers. Can you try and get someone to give me a shout out I used to do this and someone hacked my account and I couldnt do anything until everything went awayCan you get me fans
"Incredible. Im really enjoying the app, I love the views"
BEST APP EVER. too addictive this app is incredible
. Fantastic  incredible  amazing  Omg Ty for helping me get back on my account and I love this you deserve MORE  and if you guys are new you guys wont regret it :D so down this
yeah. i downloaded this app in 2018 to watch dance videos and now i hate cops
TikTok. Bc I have fun time making videos and watching videos and I can relate to them too
Please do add files. This is just a personal request but I would like to say adding files can help a lot to organise what u save
Okay but. Its cool but there has been a LOT of hacks on it so Ive deleted it and Im not sure if I should download it again. It also swears. I like it but be careful people could hack you. It also is maybe getting band for some countries and it glitches out a LOT
Opinión personal. A mi me encanta porque aprendo muchas cosas en segundos y tmb puedo cambiar mi estado de ánimo con deslizar la pantalla además es libre expresión y puedes ver de todo lo q personalmente te interesa
You have to get this soo now. Omg I love this app my friend were talking about how amazing this app is so I decided to get and to be honest so cant thank them enough for recommending it I love the face that did you dont want to post a vid you can just add it to your drafts ( a folder where vids you dont want followers or othe people to see ).I also love sharing vids with my friends so if I find something good funny or cool I can just send it to them.Pluss liking and commenting for me as a creator I found likes to be helpfully since so can see what content my viewers like. If you like a vid you can either double tap the screen or tap the heart once it so easy and also commenting was helpful as a creator but what is love was that if you dont want people to comment on your vid you can just turn comments off for that vid .Incredible app definitely recommend
Wilsu. Perfect means of fun knowledge and beats the political polluted app called Facebook instead of wasting time on personal information collecting app called instagram
Please add comments list. Can you please add a section where you can view all of the comments youve made so that incase you commented something embarrassing or rude and need to delete it but lost the video you can just go to the listen of all your comments which would probably be out in the privacy settings near all the other junk or it would be in the favourites section as its own category. Either way a comments list would be super helpful if you understand what Im sayin 
"Great open forum for anything. Incredible amount of information out there, some of it really good stuff"
"Chinese data harvesters. Dont trust China, China is asshoe"
Great. Always on top of everything and has a good quality of work one downside is that it is laggy when off WiFi and on mobile data other wise it is great fun and I have seen people I never would have and fallen in love with it I recommend it to people who want some fun if they are bored and want to make friends and see people you would not normally see. In a nut shell I am addicted and it is awesome
The worst thing humanity has ever made. Its horrible and I have tones of reasons why1: piss your pants challenge2: it steals songs3: CORONAVIRUS challenge4: that dude who just emptied a tub of Crete all on the subway5: it steals vids and uses them like ads6: it sends personal data to ChinaThere are tones more reasons why I hate tik tok and I really hope it gets removed from the app store lol
Incredible app. A lot of info here Wave of the future
DUMB. takes ur info I WANBA RATE 1 STAR ITS MAKING ME RATE 5 HELP SOBT DOWNLOAD
"Awesome app, terrible cyber bullying. Watch everyday and stay up late watching but Trump should have gotten this app deleted kids are becoming more and more introverted and killing themselves over this app the bullying people do just because its the nature of the comments is insane and people are always spreading false info and corrupted are new generation"
Ehhh. Would be a dope asf community if yall didnt steal all our info and spy on us. Pretty much pedophiles but yall arent ready for that conversation
"couldnt you a 0 so i give a 1. So, it supports rapists,homophobes,transphobes,racist and ableism but will gladly remove and block accounts that and doing nothing wrong. It constantly surprises minorities and allows hate to spread. It steals your information and overall is a breeding ground for hate"
cool man. SUMMER 19 tiktok was just on another level but now it&#39;s ight but like China steals ur info so lol
Love TikTok. Very entertaining. I lose track of time for hours
"I love TikTok. TikTok is my escape, I love itit takes all my stress and problems awayit makes me such a positive person even when Im going through my own personal stormit is everything for me, my kids love TikTok as well "
Its good but priv vids. :/. I cant watch my own private videos and its annoying
This is a incredible app. When Im bored I go in this app please make more apps like this x
Vine was better. Its a knockoff vine that sells your info to China
im in love. incredible i love it im obsessedddddby far the best on the app on the app store
"someone please help. so I tried to log in the other day after deleting it and I remember my username and password, however I dont have the same phone number and not sure which email I used to sign up. I need my number or email to verify its me but I dont have access to either. can someone please help? is there a way this can be fixed??"
An incredible app. I love tick tock I 10/10 recommended it its really fun to use make your own defenetly get it if you can
Cant log in. have been trying for days. app keeps asking for my birthday and all of a sudden it says server bit available over and over and over again. cant even use the app even it i uninstall the app and delete the data. i really dont want to start a new account i just want this issue resolved
Amazing. I really enjoy making TikTok. There are also some great hacks and gymnastics tricks out there. I highly suggest that you download this app
Spies. Would rate 0 stars if possible. Chinese app proven to be spying on users. Enough said
Luv tik and tok. I love this app bc there are thousands of videos to watch and many types of videos its incredible
Best Chinese Data Mining App. 10/10 - good job CCP
"Diane Gee. I am using this platform to showcase my keeping on the tracks video, give it a try take videos of all the fun places you visit on the train  "
No thanks. Deletes the truth and programming the young with the evil of the world China run taking everyones personal details Corrupt
This app is amazing. I cant stop watching us up and I get good exercise dancing is amazing download it
OMG. I love this app but its Annoying how you need to sign in once you get it just to use it. :(((( we should be able to type in our name or age but not give information.. that disappoints me the most:(
Happy. fixed my personal issue finally
 sad. someone stole my @ after hacking me and changing it I disappeared for 5 months as I was busy and I got back with a different @ and someone had taken my old @
Hey. This app is amazing  When theres nothing to do I sit there and watch it for hours. Best app
CCP spy app. No thanks Chyna Virus spy app
Best app I have by far. I love it download a nailOne thing that TikTok needs to do is put a just watch video on there to like show you when you just watch and its like a series I need to make it to work you can go to the one above it below it and stuff like that but they dont do that thats OK the rest of the best app I dont ever had
"great but needs some attention. ive had an amazing experience with tiktok and its been awesome, however there are some problems with syncing. with my lip syncing and my dancing videos, the audio is already ahead of me. when i record it is fine and when i check before i post it, it is also okay, but once i post it it starts lagging or whatever. i tried clearing data, i have a strong wifi, clearing the cashe, updating, restarting, redownloading, etc but nothing still worked. can you guys help with this and fix it?? or other suggestions that worked for you??"
"The new notifications inbox is horrible. I am a constant creator that gets 100s of notifications a day. Lumping in my personal messages with likes, follows and comments is just another way for messages from people I want to hear from to get lost. I find it very difficult now to find the messages from my friends when they are nixed in with all my other notifications"
Ok app but. Ok so I have been with the app for a long time from when it was musical.y and it has changed alto one some negative ways people can hack you and you have to take the risk of people judging you the app itself is amazing the people on the app on the other hand not so much I recommend using the app if you not going to show your face or dont mind getting hate but if you are sensitive then I dont recommend this app
Great App. Its an incredible app
"Bugs. Comments wont load for ages, replies wont load, videos wont load. It says if this happens to switch between mobile data and wifi and when I do that there is literally no improvement at all. I love the app, but this issue frustrates me so much and interrupts me as a user"
Really good app. I got this 7 months ago and Im only 15 and I love the savage dance as well really good app always get this people say Chinese spies can hack u but I dont care because its to much fun and i just love it when I Im sad it makes me back alive and joyful
"Exelente . Aplicación que ayuda mucho en lo social i personal , me encanta esta aplicación"
"Review. This app is literally the bestYes it will consume you whole day and you will lose track of time just scrolling through tik tok but its so funny and there are tons of different things on your for you page. The only thing I would say is there are a lot of older jokes on here not just dances, like jokes about eating disorders and thing that may be triggering or people might take offence to. As long as someone in old enough to understand everything on the app it should be fine. I think the app is rated 12+ but if a kid is over the age of 9 they should be fine"
"Amazing App. Just an incredible App for entertainment, study, mindset, relationship, religions love it "
"Hate the new update. Its so hard to watch videos now, please get RID of it as no one likes it"
The app made someone cry. Today (April 25th 2020) is my friends 17th and this app made her cry. Therefore it deserves one star for making someone incredible cry
Best app of all time. Hands down just an incredible form of entertainment
"TikTok. TikTok is literally one of the best apps,  you get to experience lots of new stuff, learn new things I actually really like the little helpful hacks on there because they can become really handy and helpful, You also get to experience new dances which is amazing, if you really love dancing then I recommend TikTok is a app for you. Ive always wanted to be a dancer but I didnt get the opportunity but now I finally get a opportunity in my life to dance on TikTok TikTok is the best Ive started becoming a really good dancer and showing off my moves to my friends , family and teachers if you havent downloaded tick-tock go download it now"
Cant even see comments. I cant even see nor comment its just loading and Im not banned pls fix its not working on my Wi-Fi nor my data
Dear TikTok. Hey TikTok can u get rid or ban the Asian girls that are liking our comments its really freaky to me and my friends the links track people down and they are acting nice but they are nice at the moment I rate TikTok 1/10 for that x
Incredible. This app gives so much ability to express talent and creativity. Love the app
"Personal interest. Im rating it 3 stars solely because thats i. The middle, but if you have any sense of humour especially dark I highly discourage downloading this app, the amount of people who dont understand satire is crazy. Also if you get on the wrong side its just Democrats vs Conservatives"
"If you agree to DL this app. Take a good look at all the personal info you GIVE UP just for a short video.  Think about that. If it was possible to rate with 0 stars I would.  It get 1 star, just because I have to"
"Tiktok is great. I have had tiktok for a while now and its the best entertainment to go to when youre bored, I would say above 13 or 14 year olds to be on tiktok personal"
"not just a kids app. i too was hesitant about downloading this app, but once i took the leap i found it broke every preconceived notion i had of it. this app is more than silly dance and lip syncing trends, its a mecca for original content the creativity on this app is insane. ive laughed and cried. ive been inspired and motivated. ive been challenged to think more deeply about things. its informed me on a plethora of subjects too. no joke, ive learned everything from how to make michelin star restaurant quality dish to finding out you can check-in the dmv electronically and turned what would have been a 2hr trip to the dmv to a 30min wait the other day. its incredible i love this app"
"Nice spying china. Fucking douchebags spying on kids, tong Wong bong shong or whatever your president is called should be ashamed"
Dont get this. Ive been on tic tok for a long time and if you havent noticed tic tic is made from a Chinese company and what they are doing is sending you personal information to some where in China tic toc  has even sed that they have done it and it will get band in us soon and hopefully get shut down I hop the the company will stay up but delete tic toc for ever best of luck  Me
Tik tok. Tik tok is so cool if you didnt already download it download it because it is a good app what is this watch out for Tik tok though can I watch cool videos life hacks and more
Scary. This app is so scary like literally I will see those Mr. incredible uncanny that freaked me out and keep me up at night plus it is full of scammers like your phone equals what you do like school is a terrible followers a great ET see
Love this app so much. Tick-tock is incredible brings people together it makes people laugh its very enjoyable
"Good . TikTok is amazing but I also think it is a little unsuitable for children . It swears a lot even with swears turned off  My personal age rating is 15 years because it also has unsuitable content that other parents wont like  Although saying that , tiktok is fun for lots of people and I would recommend it for 15+"
Fucking awful. Do you want the Chinese to spy on you?
TikTok is incredible. Hi TikTok is a really fun app to go on i love doing the dance to the car went boom and ye
Wish Id never bloody downloaded it. Now Im wasting my life on it watching videos of cats. Fml
"Disappointed. I really enjoyed the app when i first installed it, the app ran smoothly, the creators were funny and i was having fun with the app. However very randomly my app just stopped opening. I clicked the icon to open it and it kept auto closing itself so i couldnt access it at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice, i cleared my data, none of which worked. Im really disappointed"
Lit. At first I downloaded the app just to watch videos then I ended up making my own videos . Definitely lit fm
Fine. Its good in some parts bc the videos can be funny but also really inipropite and it also stakes your personal data and brings it to a place on Chine so you can get it if you want
Awesome spy app. :)
"Fav app. This has quickly become my favorite app. It never fails to amaze me on how many like-minded folks are out there. Im so thankful to get to know these incredible people who grace my fyp Goodtrouble and the like, Im lookin at you guys"
"Lots of fun. Lots of fun and information, great app"
Entertain and inform. Lots of great videos for enjoyment In Your personal and professional life
Valid opportunity and social fun. This app is filled with surprises.  Ages from young to old can have a lot of fun and create an incredible following.  The sky is the limit
"I dont know whats happened. My wifi connection is as good as ever and I have tried on my mobile data, and I can not load videos to watch (they keep freezing. They occasionally play with the audio cutting in and out in spats so you cant make anything out). And I cannot upload at the minute. Video gets to 95% and then fails every time. It wont work at all"
What I think about TikTok. TikTok is a very fun app you can make vids get followers and more and even follow your idols you should download the app fr (this isnt a bot )
Incredible. Very addicting and easy to use and quite fun to be able to see more creators on TikTok
Awful ( J K). Tiktok is incredible and very fun people can express themselves and show other people who they are  Sh*t I mean TikTok excepts uuu for uuu especially the LGBTQIA community gets to show everyone who they REALLY are and it inspires young people to do the same <3
TikTok. Hey TikTok isnt really making me feel good I have to access to make videos and I cant it wont let TIKTOK HELP ME
TIKTOK. Amazing absolutely amazing just be prepared to lose hours on watching it I am addicted it has swearing in I wouldnt get until 12+ the recommended age a lot of swearing so supportive no hate apart from some comments remember to add ur privacy settings u can express ur feelings and emotions so helpful so many categories I recommend if ur insecure
"Tysm its so much its such a good app. I think its an incredible app its like YouTube but is more easy to upload vids. I really hope it stays Thank you so much for this app <3. :),"
I love this app(tt:alssya_xx. This is amazing so many good futures its just incredible
Evil App. Why you want to show your face on this app? The Chinese are tracking on everyones faces around the world and killing their own like fishes but you guys chosen to turn the blind eyes on this?
ages. i put my age multiple times but when i accidently set it to 13 it confirmed it. Im 16 turning 17 and i should be allowed to have my dms and comment sections back. I do not want to make a new account because of all the progress ive made on my old one. My user is @discodiido i hope i can change my date of birth as i do not need the privacy of a under 16 year old child. I am responsible enough to have my dms open and my comments aswell. Please fix this
TikTok love. You bring out the kid in everyone that TikTok. Everyone has a release phase. And you give us the opportunity to do just that. From babies to our incredible senior citizens. Im not a great TikTok er but I do my best to join a group of fun and creative people from all around the world. Thanks and keep us wanting more TikTok. I still cant do that shuffle dance 
hey. tiktok so fun to watch
"Tik Tok Review. Tik Tok is honestly one of the best apps of all time. It is literally the cure to boredom. On top of that its free to download, which is very generous. Due to Tik Tok, many normal teenagers have become famous and are now perusing an incredible new career. Charli DAmelio recently starred on the Tonight Show (presented by Jimmy Fallon) and that it completely because of Tik Tok Watching videos on Tik Tok is addictive I am sure the hands on my clock move five times faster when Im scrolling through my For You Page. Secondly making your own personal Tik Toks is also great fun. The possibilities are endless The facilities that all users are given on Tik Tok for free is magnificent. Tik Tok is definitely an app worth a five star rating. TIK TOK IS AMAZING-Cameron H"
"So bad. 1. Let me just say, its probably not a Chinese spy app2. Cmon, why would you just delete ugly peoples posts?3. Wheres the creativity?4.cringe"
ITS THE WORST. ITS THE FRICKEN WORST THEY STEAL YOUR PASSWORD AND STUFF IF YOU GET HACKED DONT BLAME ME YOUR FAULT IF YOU WERE ALLOWED TO I WOULD PUT STARS
4/5. Because of the spying you get 4

Just great. Im 55. This is better than tv. Constantly updating with fresh content allowing humans to show how incredible and how incredibly awful we are
rubbish. I am ChineseI want to play APP abroad.With I downloaded itit is too slow to playI cannot watch anything
Invite rewards is a scam to attract more users. Tiktok reward amount keeps changing during the process of sending invitation. And they made the whole process non intuitive. I invited a few people and tried to follow their vague condition as much as it made sense but at the end there was no reward. They just use it to lure people. They also had privacy breach and they are not compliant to privacy laws
"Incredible App. I really have nothing to say bout his amazing app, all i have too say is, Great job byte dance"
"Absolutely amazing. This app is my fav app on my whole phone I love watching all the cool vids and life hack vids this app is really really really good you can watch from movie scenes to daily life hacks its got basically everything you would want to watch I think personally that this app is amazing, fantastic and awesome but if you dont thats fine weve all got our opinions This is why Im rating this a 5/5 star "
Incredible app. This app has made me more happier and less bored in times. Thank you for making an app with a great community
AMAZING but. This app is amazing u can create funny content and watch short videos. My personal one problem is that I think that there should be a childrens mode so kids can watch without hearing swearing. Thats it Otherwise this app is amazing
"Great but. I think that TikTok is an incredible app and I  use it every day although it takes a lot of my data up and because of that I need to remove videos from my favourites and I wish there was a way of selecting all of the videos from my favourites and unfavouriting them all at once because I have thousands of videos and its taken me weeks only to do a quarter of them, I know this might seem a bit weird but if you would put a select button and a select all button so I could unfavourite them all, I would give this a five stars my request is a bit weird but if you can make it happen thank you x"
Worst app. Its one of the worst app in iOS. Must be removed from my phone to save memory and data. There is no option for us to select by our own its all predefined and will shows only trending videos
"FANTASTIC APP. This app is incredible, bringing the creativity out of the very best creators"
Incredible. Tick-tock is my absolute fav app its so addicting and fun I highly recommend it its ANAZIBG
"Brilliant. I love using tiktock, not only have I had many laughs and giggles but I have come to learn new skills such as pottery and knitting just from watching incredible videos from other artists I also love interacting with making my own videos, their is always lots of fun trends to follow and, theirs always room to be creative. Tiktock is also brilliant at keeping its environment safe and positive for you to use"
Review. Tick tock is a fun app where you can post funny videos and dances but be careful who you come across because some people can hack and be very rude to you
Malvin review. I very good app to watch funny videos get lots of information from it also you can post your own videos.Its the best app Ive ever been on
I love tik tok. Lets start with pros ummmm yall know lol any way cons there is only one it uses so Much data and space
scamer. i got scamed by mexican spy
Amazing. Awesome app so much stuff to do just incredible
chile anyways-. u really do be spying on us doe
chinese spy. what i said
"Best app to download. Incredible as a young mom of two, I cant get out much. This app makes up for it.. makes me feel like a QUEEEEEENNN"
Ador aceasta aplicație. Deci pe Tik Tok eu personal stau 24/7 și ador aceasta aplicație (recomand 100%)
Addicted. Can o get on fyp love tik tok it is an incredible app I was wondering if I can get citified and get on the fyp and get 2k thx
"Very enjoyable. Not much bad about it its entertaining, funny and you can pick your own category of entertainment. Only thing Id say is that it can just lose connection when you have wifi or data. Other than that its good"
My accounts lol. I used to be able to add two accounts and I could switch between them. This was really convenient because it meant I could keep a personal account and an art account. Idk if its a glitch but Im not able to add the second account to switch over anymore. Please fix this Thank you :D
Tik tok is not fair but it is good. Look I love Tik tok but it is not fair that kids cant use it And U ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHINA GOVERNMENT ON SPYING ON PPL
mark zuckerberg. the russians are spying on us
Search engine. The search engine TikTok uses is amazing The fact that you can type in lyrics or quotes and it finds the audio -every misnomers- is incredible and unmatched
"Unequal opportunity algorithm. Please take immediate steps to reprimand Tik Tok for unfair mass disproportional censorship of black creators. Tik Tok has used their algorithm to facilitate racism, discrimination and their derivatives while justifying their actions admitting to censoring posts by creators THEYconsidered susceptible to bullying based on their PHYSICAL or mental conditions. Their negligent actions have caused a surplus of inaccurate data &amp; fake information and will continue to mislead others #19th"
"Incredible, funny, enjoyable. Tick tok is the best download now. really"
5 star. An incredible app nothing wrong with it if you are bored this is the app and it is creative and all together a GREAT app
"Age restrictions. My mother let me have Tik Tok when I was 8 and I told her about the age restrictions and boom Im off tik tok, if this happens to you, dont get all sad because your parents/Guardians just want to keep you safe from personal or judgmental comments and they mean no harm they just dont want you to get offended or judged by somebody that they cant talk to because theyre a stranger and if you are 12 or over and people comment silly or swearing comments they just want a reaction so just delete their comment you just dont reply or overreact when they do that kind of nonsense stuff, in summary thats why I certainly believe that you should be atleast 9 or 10 to have Tik  Tok "
"I cant log into my other accounts. The new update makes it so you have to add your phone number into or your email to access other accounts, i find this annoying. My friend has got logged out of her main account and has deleted her email for the account, she also has no phone number, for the next update I would like to see this change, and we can log in normally. Many thanks Alesha bell"
LOL. I LOVE WATCHING ADOPT ME HACKS IN ROBLOX DOWNLOAD AND DO A HACK LOVE FROM A BIG FAN OF TIKTOK
Jaygoldofficial. It was full of fun but it consumed data
I cant log in. I deleted the app for a personal reason and I went to log back into my account and it kept registering my email with someone elses account . I cant log back in because everytime I go to change my password it says verification with another random number. IT NEVER BEFORE
Malvin review. I very good app to watch funny videos get lots of information from it also you can post your own videos
Amazing. I spend hours on this app with my free time during this pandemic. Ive also learned a lot from being on this app its kind of incredible how much you can learn from 30-60 videos
Incredible. I love this app so much it makes me feel so creative
Why I love tik tok. It shows me cool new dance that me and my can try out.its super fun to do the privacy is good to I love tik tok soo thank you to all the makers of tik tok
Incredible app. Im in love with everything that is tik tok Best app out there number #1
"gross. addicting, pointless, steals ur info and gives it to the chinese government, racist, sexist, homophobes, horrible influence"
Terrible. Terrible dont download You will get hacked
Tik Tok is crap. I uninstalled tik tok and i already feel betterPeople who spend hours of their day on tiktok are abducted TikTok addicts/aliensDo not spend all your time on tik tok it controlls your life its scary Yes yes it is yes yes...From personal experience Yes yes it is yes yes
"Worst app ever. The app is terrible, it doesn't fix bugs or glitches. Too many negativity. Used to track users. Very un-fun. I hate it"
Dont give this app bad reviews. Dont give this app bad reviews yes I know youre probably thinking no whatever Ill do what I want wow its not appropriate for kids thats why App Store always gives an age limit thats why you should tell your kids before they download it go on the App Store find the app and see what age it is if your lower than it then dont download it but if you are higher than the age then download this is 13+ it says 17+ but theyre changing it hi Im 17 so go ahead tell your kids this if theyre over 17 or just normally 13 then going if they want to count you can give them a private account so if they except a follower those are the only people that can see the videos that they make yes they have bad words but if you allow your kids to listen to them go ahead but you will hear those in the songs
"Good app. I think this app is amazing based off of personal experience. I think it should be rated a bit higher than it is there is literally 8 year olds on this app which is WAY to young to be there, the reason it should be rated higher is humour. People as young as that may not understand it and use it/ take it the wrong way. But I do recommend this app, its amazing"
"glitchy. tiktok isn't loading right. nobody's pfp is loading,  no video covers are loading, no covers for anything rly except for a few are loading. when i try to make a video with an audio that's cover hasnt loaded, it says unstable network connection. when i try to post videos in general, it always stops at 61%. i've tried clearing my cache, deleting and redownloading the app, restarting my phone, and i've been on multiple different peoples wifi not to mention data and it still does this. i haven't been able to post videos in over a month because of this"
Loving to laugh . I like this site a lot. I dont like the fact that there are scam artist on here trying to get personal information. These people have several pages under different names
Amazing . Quality The quality is good but not 100 with data it is poor quality but Wi-Fi works amazing  Videos Although ticktock is amazing rude videos are posted sometimes I recommend ticktock it is amazing still
horrible app. very horrible App if you are a parent dont let your children get this app. They will be mindlessly scrolling through potentially harmful things to them. On this app it is a lot ofinteresting personalities that have communities there and A LOT of them arent kid friendly . its very easy to lose track of time and its very addicting. Please parents and teenagers dont download this app if you are doing good in life and want to keep a happy mindset
The Chinese. They spy on you
"Cant browse without logging in. When I first downloaded the app, I could watch videos and not login. No more. Now I can only access the log in screen. No thanks TikTok. Guess Im deleting it again"
TIK TOK. Because this is such an incredible app that I love and always will
"What makes TikTok special ?. Everyone thinks The time and sound track and easy upload features makes Tik tok unique special.But thats not the case, Tik Tok is fun as it is fast , never crashes, super easy that simple"
Takes childrens data and promotes pedophilia. Enough said
Great. Its a lovely app I have 3million likes and the dances are incredible
"Tiktok es una gran plataforma. Me he dado cuenta de que tiktok es la plataforma más estable y visualizada del momento, tanto en sus funciones que son fácil de entender para todo público, el servicio que nos brinda es muy bueno, el personal que tienen para cuando hay fallos responden casi de manera inmediata, tenía un problema y me resolvieron bastante pronto, ayuda a los nuevos usuarios que son talentosos a ser conocidos por el mundo es la única plataforma que te impulsa a demostrar lo que sabes hacer y que los demás sepan valorar los talentos que tenemos en esta plataforma, gracias tiktok por cambiar tantas vidas "
"Whats happening?. My app has been lagging all day. I have good wifi and even with my own fast data its lagging. If I stop the video, it gets worse and wont be able to continue watching it, will have to start it over"
"Inappropriate language, religious fighting . Good platform for fun But mostly people are using inappropriate language on it Fight about religionPeople took it very seriously regarding their personal things Should be understandable its just fun platform, Benito for fight to each other"
Tiktokkkk. I think tiktok is the greatest app it helps me with hacks and I love watching morning routines add me up @cristina_ox 
Stop this. Hi TiktokI have been recently noticing some people following or liking my vids/and or comments but their username is like random letters and numbers and their profile picture says 18+ and they have a link and if you click it it shows inappropriate stuff plus they can track you.Please ban all of these s3x bots please :(.Stxrm_rider_<3
Incredible app. I really love this app
Tik Tok. Hey everyone this app is amazing I love doing my videos on here (DOWNLOAD NOW)
My personal experience. Absolutely worthwhile
Amazing app. Incredible entertainment for all Very fun app
Amazing but. I think tiktok is great but there is a problem there is a lot of drama going on and a lot of young children swear on it  I think that the drama could go away if the people would do this in their personal lifes and in real life and not worry others and do lives and saying their sad and all that because then the followers throw hate on others and that causes GREAT drama  but tik tok is still good and I recommend it 
"Why is TikTok fun. TikTok is a very fun app. You can learn new dances and do new things but best of all, you can be yourself.My personal favourite dance is the Savage dance (Im A Savage, Classy, Boujie Ratchet.) The reason I have given it a five star is because of the different content you can make"
Tatti app. Worst app ever  Doesnt even have a good class. This app is like the sewer system because the videos are like garbage in their. This is my personal opinion
China spies on u. Read title
Addicted. Can i get on fyp love tik tok it is an incredible app I was wondering if I can get citified and get on the fyp and get 2k thx

"Tik Tok is the best. Theres so much going on with this app. You can learn almost anything you want to learn with a simple search, and the entertainment on the app is incredible I love Tik Tok"
"pLeAsE HeLp uS gEt oUr dRaFtS bAcK bEfOrE i cRy.. all of my drafts got deleted when i deleted the app and reinstalled in. you guys should make it so that no drafts get deleted on their own unless were the ones deleting them and you guys should give back all deleted drafts if possible. besides that, theres nothing wrong with this app in my own personal opinion. im just not happy with the fact that my drafts are gone"
"GREAT APP. On tik tok, you can make your own vids and post them-a bit like music videos You can make a private account where only certain People can see your videos and omg there are so many different effects, types of videos and effects you can use-as well as great-quality transitions I only downloaded this about a week ago but Im already in love-its quite easy to figure it out tbh. SO DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD THIS APP "
Best app swear down. Incredible Amazing one of a kind completely never been done before
Very good. A very good fun incredible interesting app  download
"TIK TOK IS HORRIBLE. TIK tok is cringeworthy, it is transphobic, its racist, its sexist, and their are alleged spys"
"So fun but so addicting. Absolutely love this app and what you can do with it but its not for kids, although many kids use it. Its easy for inappropriate video to come up and its common for people to lose track of time on this app because of the addicting content. Super fun and would recommend for 13+ audience"
Best game EVER. Its the best game ever I get to show my joy and have fun with friends on there other people should really use this app (If they want) and its amazing Even the movements on tictok is just so incredible even the fact that there are so many effects I hope TikTok stays forever Just like musically did...before it-NEVERMIND As I said I love tictok stay strong tictok fans (tictok 2021 Is AWSOME)
I like it. Enjoy what you will and scroll by the rest. Dont take things too personal and take it with a grain of salt  I love the variety on TicTok and everyones creativity Amazing
"The best. It has done so much for my personal and business life, Bc of TT Ive definitely blessed"
"Entertaining & Easy, but a little invasive. Awesome to watch funny clips on but I wish it respected privacy a little more "
You tapped on collective consciousness & won. I appreciate FY is by individual interest. Thank you for bringing the world together in one App. Your timing is incredible/ definitely has staying power
Very Entertaining. Best app Ive ever used. Great way to kill time or lose track of time
"For the laughs. TikTok is great for laughs and recipes too as long as you dont take it personal, youll find it enjoyable too"
Jimmima. So so recommended . So so enjoy just going on for a laugh . I love this app .so much vids .get followers u can follow people.get new friends. I&#39;m on it every day . So many new dances to learn . I have give so much info I can. And u can text on it to.and u can go live.

Incredible addictive app. Wow
"TIK TOK. It is an amazing app with incredible content. You can also make you own vidios and edit them. I you are looking to get this app, then I recommend it to you, definitely a five "
China. Chinese spy app dont download
Really good. Its a good app but be careful what u watch kk
"I like this app but. When I want to use tik tok, the picture of the app on my phone looks weird and doesnt let me go into it. So I delete it an re install it but it thinks its still downloaded. I dont know how to install it again and I really want to use the app. Please help, thanks"
"AMAZING I MEAN AMAZING. I love this app this app, i highly recommend getting it you can do loads of fun effects and you can also watch your friends tik toks. In my personal opinion its wayyyyy better that musical.ly Im sorry but it is I dont think you could even give any more upgrades to itThis app is very addicting"
Pmgogmgoggmgo. So good. So I downloaded this app a long time ago when it was musically and IT WAS SO FUNNNN SND STILL IS YOU CAN WATCH AND DO ANYTHING ON THIS
"Great App. Its fun and entertaining, just dont go on it before exams because youll lose track of time and fail. "
"Great fun Valuable Information and Unique Characters. This is the place of many unique things , informative, comedic, health centered, personal and plenty of helpful worth info"
"Loving Tik Tok. So much fun, so many different people and cultures to embrace, the personal stories, the funny and outrageous shenanigans I spend way to much of my precious time on here.Beware Its addicting"
Download this app. Its a really good app and you should watch TickTocks    
Love it. Unbiased info where the narrative isnt controlled
"fix it. hey so i opened the app to enjoy some funny content today however when i opened the app, the videos did not play. i reinstalled the app as well as powered off and on my phone to make sure it wasnt just my phone that was acting up. and yes, i do have my wifi on and my connection is strong. i even tried with my data, nothing. so please fix it soon :/"
NO GOOD. CCP SPY TOOL
"Amazing App. I think that Tik Tok is an incredible app that people (any age) can use You can post vids of you singing, dancing, makeup tutorials...you name it Definitely recommend"
Im in love. This is an incredible app that I recommend a lot
awesome. I think that tik tok is a great app. The variety of users is incredible and any kind of person can join. The only thing that I can think that could make it better is that when you are filming you cant watch videos. This can be very anoying when you are peicing a vid together over servral days you cant use it. Other than that I love it
Adaptation. I really do enjoy this app. It gives me the information that I want but at the same time the things that I need to make me laugh. DJ Swayzee
"Blurry videos. Lately, my recent uploads seem to be very blurry compared to how they look when theyre being edited through tik tok. And yes, my data saver is turned off"
I really like TikTok I dont watch the battle me I literally have 90 something followers so yeah. Hey
"All it does is freeze. All it does it freeze. Like every five seconds no matter on data or wifi, in the middle of no where or in the city. Its just like constantly loading videos that are only 3 seconds"
It has too many teens girls dancing. This is the worst app ever get rid of it also u steal music
Brilliant. I would easily put a 5/5 the reason why is u can watch funny humour and its not rude also you kids or you could get into dancing and dance on tiktok you would get a lot of viewers and also you can make a private account where only people you let can watch if your worried
I love this app. This app should be for 11 yrs olds to cause it shows what you like and your personal and it shows that you are not shy to dance in front of ppl its shows that we can do it even is your a beginner its so good for you and your parents show out your personal and ppl would she who your really are <3
"TERRIBLE. POISIONING OUR YOUNG AND CHINESE GOVERNMENT USE TO SPY, VERY BAD DO NOT RECCOMEND INSTEAD GET JOB AS NFT ARTIST"
"Does not remove abusive behaviour. Things tik tok does not deem as violations: being a nazi openly, white supremacy, yelling slurs, defending rapists, defending mass murderers, sexually harassing women, direct bullying, specifically targeted members of protected groups, sex crimes.Things tik tok deems as violations: talking about personal experiences with no named or places named, science, defending yourself from bigotry, women"
Awesome sound effects for personal post. The sound effects are great. Good work
Chinese data farming. Just like it says in the title. Data being farmed from minors
Best game. Its the best game ever I get to show my joy and have fun with friends on there other people should really use this app (If they want) and its amazing Even the movements on tictok is just so incredible
Review. It just makes my unwind fun watching these videos and also getting information other people..awesome
Love it. Excellent for creativity but when I tried to use one of my own copyrighted tracks on one of my copyrighted videos I got a message saying THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS NOT AUTHORIZED THE USE OF THIS MUSIC?????????
Ching Chong. The Chinese spy on us
Just incredible. It is an amazing app and if you put work on you really do get rewarded. I would definitely recommend. One negative is that is is very addictive
New video format. I hate the new video format on my personal videos like ewwww grosss change it back
Love TikTok. Hey tik tok am just love it to see and watch all vids Thankx you
"Triffic Ticks TeeHee Tocks. This App has made lockdown that little bit easier, theres so many wonderful, heartwarming, funny &amp; sometimes downright HILARIOUS videos from some incredible creators Love it "
"Amazing. This app is better than musically and is incredible for every age its just an app to have fun on, it is amazing and its definitely a 5/5 bcs its an awesome app"
. I learned a lot i can spend all day just watching videos from hacks to touching moments
Personal favorite. I love seeing my friends and family show small parts of their lives. Literally the only app that doesnt crash on me
Ayo. Hey so tiktok is good thank you I Watch it every day so thank you for making the app
"Worst app of the decade. Not usefull waste of time, it&#39;s use more data and battery power 0 rating I should recommend, don&#39;t install please"
Most Incredible App. This app is family
Dont want anything to do with China. More China spy crap

Apple. Tiktok is an incredible app for fan bases especially one direction x
"TIK TOK DEVELOPERS PLEASE SEE. TIK TOK DEVELOPERS PLEASE SEE I have been using Tik Tok for a little over a year and all of a sudden, your For You page is telling me youve reached the end , unstable internet connection and unable to load command. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app, no luck, Ive reset network settings, that hasnt done anything either, Ive put my phone into airplane mode, then back to WiFi &amp; data, Ive also tried switching from WiFi to data and neither of them load Tik Tok. ALL my other apps load fine and work properly. What the hell is going on Tik Tok? FIX IT"
"App broken. Have not been able to use the app for over 2 weeks now. refuses to load videos, claiming no internet connection. have redownload ed, restarted countless times and still nothing. Would love if there was a way to access app support that isnt within the app. Every time i go to the website or even through this page to get to app support its not possible to open due to the apps error. Would love a fix as I do really love the app when it works"
Really good one. Tik tok is an amazing game u can put your acc private so that is more chance that some one will not hack you
"Yikes. Lawsuits, selling childrens information and everything on here makes me wanna blow my brains out cuz its super cringe. Shoutout to the 4 people that are actually funny. People say this is vine 2 but its just cancer. Take my word and all the others that hate it"
Ticktockcock. Absolute cancer. This is for beta males and yutes. Download it at you or personal risk
Entertaining. It is very good entertainment but you lose track of time watching tiktoks 
Dont be harsh. Yes there has been a not nice vid but stop trying to have a go at them. They are trying to delete but it keeps getting reposted. I think it is great only a few glitches. I just want to know if they do really spy on you?
"Problem that needs fixing. Hi there, I love using your app everyday and am just as addicted to it as everyone else. However, every time I try to change my profile picture - it disappears after I close the app. I have tried reinstalling it and messaging your help page to no avail. Another problem is that half of the sounds that I use (just like everyone else), gets removed from my video (not others), decreasing the point of the video. Please help me fix the following issues, thank you :) PS: how do we get the new beautify mode? Ive tried updating but nothing pops up, would love to use it "
Tik Tok. Hey this app is amazing I love doing my videos on here download now thanks bye
Khod_fsh. Spy ware
True fail. If you want repetitive comedy bad dancing and your information stolen download this app All things aside this app is cringe and no one should get this
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is my personal opinion so please dont get offended. I am obsessed with this app, its amazing However, some of the videos of comments are disgusting. Please block these people"
"Always interesting. I&#39;m always on tiktok. I&#39;m 67 years old and I like watching cosplay to dances to receiving information to do things with my laptop, mobile or PC. I especially love watching partners or married couples playing tricks on each other"
"Mias personal review. I loveeeeee it, it sooo good to watch when ur bored and recommend it for people who like dancing or showing their lives or want to change others(lives)"
Bro. I saw a vid of some guy killing themselves and all his guts were pooring out and his dog walked in and saw his insides also why is tiktok tracking us also why are there so manh racists and pedos and homophobics 
Dont. Its literally spy ware. DO NOT INSTALL
"SOMEONE HELP PLEASE. I was receiving creator fund then had a notification to switch to a business profile, after switching to a business profile my creator fund has disappeared. I only have the option to switch back to a personal account. What should i do?"
Max Flinn. What an incredible app
Incredible App. This app is incredible simple as that 
Terrible App. Encourages the younger demographic to dance/role play in front of a camera for views thinking it would get them a sustainable future. The developers should focus on creating something more beneficial to the population rather than making something temporarily trendy for personal gain. Such apps shouldnt exist
"Still enjoying. Its my own secret pleasure, occasionally sharing with close ones, but mostly my personal enjoyment"
Thanks. Thank you TikTok for doing stuff we enjoy and love you help us to all do pictures food hacks thanks TikTok
TikTok is the best. You can watch cool videos and life hacks and there is a lot of cool songs
Live Connection. The only issue I have is when I go Live or join in someones live. There is a big problem with the lagging the freezing and things of that nature. Wether Im on WiFi or just using my data. Can this be fixed please?
Good. Great for killing time and data
Love watching your vids. Awesome content per personal preference algorithm
Amazing. I love love love TikTok and have had so much fun making vids and watching them too Just make sure that you monitor what ur kid is watching if they download
"Tik tok relative newbie but can I ask one thing. Hi there tik tok. Only been really active here for 3 months but have met some real awesome ppl , both on the app and in real life.   The thing that would really be totally awesome to me, and the live streaming ppl I know from around the world who stream drones, is the addition of the RTMP protocol to enable us to show our world thru the drone to tik tok .    I hope that this will be implemented in the near future as tik tok will benefit so much from the added personal and more application exposure Regards. Grant"
"Videos dont load on wifi. My wifi is working perfectly fine for every app except for tiktok, the thumbnail loads but the video wont play unless im using my data, i have a friend with the same problem. Please fix"
Incredible addictive app. Amazing
Tik Tom. Addictive app with some incredible features included in app nice
BEST APP EVER. Just incredible
"One of the best apps I have ever downloaded. #norgrets. Hey, imma make this short for ya, I just love the app, millions of comedy videos and stuff, and it has came so far Well done for making an amazing app "

Incredible. This is a really good app with so many features and it doesnt crash very often
"It is amazing. As an older woman, I am hooked on TikTok. I have learned all ages use it. Its incredible"
Because it deserves it. They are the lowest form of scum. Its literally just the communist party of China spying on naïve kids
Incredible app. This app is an educational wonder
"Cleaning hacks and DIY crafts just for starters. Great app and has so many things to enjoy. I spend hours watching cleaning hacks, cooking, crafts and witchcraft Oh and dont forget anything the dance challenges Neon Moon and Fancy Like have zillions of people doing them and they are great to watch"
Fantastic app. INCREDIBLE APP AND MY FAVOURITE APP EVER

"Greatest app of all time. This App has taught me so much more than any teacher, school, course, family member or friend has ever taught me.   Incredible content"
I love it. Its cool when you have noting to do personal it practice my English because normally I speak French and its just amazing

China number one. All hail the great communist party of China. I too love giving away all my personal data so that it can be sold by a Winnie the Pooh lookalike
HELP. I cant make my liked videos private cause the option isnt showing but other people can do it
Tik tok. Incredible app...with so much diversity...Vibez and energy...thank you tik tok
Music. I have my personal account and one for my business page. When it comes to my business page the music selection is missing all popular music. Its not found. Help?
"Funny stuff but to much fakes. Love anything that is positive. One day I might stop watching because of my personal values on some stuff. Love seeing babies and dogs.., love good stuff. Hate real fake people. Hate bad comments our judgements. Im prety opened minded.I have a 15 year old son, teach him some many lessons by explaining real facts to him.  It sure if other parents do. Then again. Dont think my comments will change anything. Everything is about money. Good luck"
Garbage. Chinese friggin spies
7 yrs. Ive been on this app for seven years now since it was musical.ly so I was wondering if you could change it up a little bit like different filters because it can get a bit boring sometimes but Im addictidthanks so much for making this app its incredible I love it so much
Great. Ive been using since musical.ly and its great but it seems like most of the popular tiktokers are girls doing dancers whos followers are 12 year old boys lmao but theres a few people i like watching. Also it chews up data like crazy  so I dont watch it that much now
Dont get this. Its full of creepy men and it is a spy tool by the Chinese
"Familia. En lo personal a mi familia y mi persona nos encanta Tik Tok. Es una sana forma de divertirte , aprendes divirtiéndote de diversos temas; adquirimos conciencia que somos seres humanos y es mas fácil sobrevivir si nos llevamos bien unos con otros. Mi esposo, mis hijas , y yo tenemos tenemos Tik Tok he invertimos tiempo mirando y haciendo videos  Felicidades al creador de Tik Tok , Buen trabajo"
Dont install. This is made by Chinese spys . They are watching your every move . They may be hacking you right now . Search on the internet for this . It has been confirmed
Luv it. I love tic tok but im an ausie so i cri and china spy
"Me encanta TikTok. Me gusta porque hay videos divertidos, de motivación , de aprendizaje y informativa es una plataforma que en lo personal me desestresa.. pero lo que no me gusta es que cuando sale contenido no bueno uno no puede decir no me gusta sería bueno tener esa aplicación para que no saliera esos tipos de videos"
"James Allen. The app is fukn incredible,, I really love it"
Lol China. China is spying on us
Reddit soldier here. Chinese data miners
Incredible app. This app is apsolutly flawless it one of the best apps in the world I do recommend adding some more effects and were you can have a effect were you pretend you out in like a waterfall but like on green screen you can tell that it fake but if u fix it a bit I would be very much helpful except from that it flawless amazing incredible and a stunning app keep up the good work tiktok it is a aprroval from me bye

My fav app. Wasn't good laughs download this app but beware it steals your time bad LOL
"Chinese Malware. As far as malware, its enjoyable.One star for concentration camps and data mining for a communist regime"
Awesome. Tik tok is so fun and random so if you dont know what to watch then just download the app and dance
Awesome. China is not spying on us
Idk. Hey my Notification Center looks weird
Bandh Karo. Saala puri duniya ko hijada bana diya hai. Saala hamara data se hamari hi gaand marte ho Youtube teri mausi- Instagram tera yaar- Sab bolo yaar - Lavda ka sarkar Account hi delete kar diya
Great app. So much fun to see the creativity and personal stories of inspiration on this app.  Who knew humans were so amazing?
"Meh. Its great in all but some things I dont think should be on here like surgery, i know it is just like a human but really, it could make someone sick and ive been seeming a bit of kinda personal things but a part from that its pretty good"
Tick tick?. I dont know what to say but I love this app. At times it can get weird but it does have useful information and is fun to use 10/10 would recommend. 
"Tik tok. Really entertaining and you lose your track of time watching it, funny and goofy but the bullying is increasing"
Yas. Very good information and entertainment and very easy to use
"Addictive. There certainly are some beautiful me to gaze at. Safe. People are generally interesting and fun. Some situations are emotional and my heart goes out to them.There seems to be a lot more cynical and critical people as of December 31, 2021.  Comments that have no  purpose other than to criticize someone or demean talents, preferences and other personal choices in all walks of life. I plan to continue using the site and what I think is offensive and inappropriate I will scroll by.  Some people are just looking for a fight or drama.  Move on"
"Not for kids. This is not for kids If you install it and dont select anything specific to watch, it just starts showing random videos that are not appropriate for kids or young adults And it keeps showing one after another until you turn it off.Also the company is from Asia and collects your personal info for who knows what purpose"
Great time sucker. Good info but it totally sucks you in
Snakes. Yall be selling email addresses and private stuff. Yall are snAKES
Tik tok. Incredible download so entertaining
Everthing Is There. Yes - you may want to forbid your kids from accessing it because yes - things are there they shouldnt see - but thats becoming true in every asoect of their life For me - I find Gospel Songs Prayers Garden Hacks Life Hacks 50s songs Nice people Good good good things Guess we find what we look for Im loving it
I watch this on a daily basis. This is so fin to watch and it get rid of time fast
Craziness. Theres always surprises crazy people around the world you find information on a lot of things
A light in the dark. Im still new to this app but I am enjoying it so much Ive found camaraderie here that I dont have in my daily personal life. Its truly been a light in this dark time of my life
No. Tic tok is a ugly horrible creature that is filled with 50 year olds or 2 year olds or just Middle aged stupid people DONT GET THE APP.It is the new version of cringe. SORRY CHINA BUT I DONT liKE PEOPLE STEALING MY INFO
"Uplifting and funny. I never used to watch Tik Tok videos but now I wake up and immediately start watching them for an immediate wake me up surge of energy. I really enjoy the DIY, recipes, definitely exercise routines and the motivational speakers. All in one place. Lets not forget the coffee thoughts, comedians and personal videos like I did for my niece. Thank you "
Lagging and slow loading. First of all bring back the ability to remove comments from live. Lagging and loading is a consistent problem im having no matter what data connection i use. I will either get a blank video screen with all the looks of it actually working but no video will play. Sometimes a video will start playing right away but then i cant swipe to another one or refresh feed
"Business Profile Not Working. Ive switched my profile to a business one, but the option to add a clickable link is not there like it said it would be. All the info lines look the same as a personal profile"
"Tik tok is actually pretty good. This is a very great app for young adults with funny, incredible, awesome and unbelievable things and ideas I use this app myself and I think its pretty good even though some of my friends at high school make fun of me for making tik toks all the time I still love this app I recommend it 5 stars but for ages 17+"
"Videos take too long to load. Ive noticed that sometimes it take a little bit longer to load my videos. Sometimes I have to turn off my wifi then switch back onto data so it can load. And I dont have slow wifi, I have Fibe internet. Please fix this issue Thanks"
Love tik tok. You get to hear other peoples personal stories and you learn a lot. Especially during COVID you feel a sense of fellowship
Funny. This app is outstanding. There are so many things on there to choose from; some are more funny some are dances or even life hacks or conversations and illusions
What I think of tiktok. Its my personal favourite app I could spend hours on this app and just not get bored u can create all sorts of videos :)
"Love close up and personal. I love the way I have become a part of their lives especially 1 special lady with her racehorse Bean. My Great Love Of Horses with many other people who own them i can get the experience everyday of riding.Just turned 60, guess what my children have paid for me to go on a hours HORSE RIDE, havent been on a horse in 40 odd YEARS. This is through my talking about my young life with horses and sending them videos. Thank you Tik Tok"
"I hate tik tok. Tik tik is not fun idk why people like it so much but they talk about it all the time...and its so annoying I dont get why people do weird/dumb things and you like it, thats boring(This is personal all you tik tok lovers I dont get all the hype)"
Tik tok brings you the world . It can be a mix between bumper car and roller coaster ride of emotions  From heartfelt to heartache Hilarious to shared personal disaster Inspirational to condemnation You choose the direction Get on or off
"I love it but I must admit. I love this game dont get me wrong, its creative and makes ur day, but people are sending things very inappropriate like people killing them self or anything not right, if your child or whoever is under the age of 12 do not allow them to have it, Ive heard that people are hacking and finding out peoples information, I dont want to scare u but its the truth, Ive also heard that this game might, just might shut down for good, I dont want that to happen but if people are getting hurt, we dont want that as an issue, great game, just needs a little more improvement Have a good day"
Good but waste of time . Exciting but waste of time and data
Question. Why isnt my tik tok working with my data
10/10. Best download ever. Also watch Spy Family
100000000000/10. Its amazing I downloaded as a joke and now its the only thing I watch on my phone
Love close up and personal. I love the way I have become a part of their lives especially 1 special lady with her racehorse Bean
Amazing. They have all the right privacy and is very fun to have five stars
Hey. I like titkok because its fun to watch titkoks and post titkoks
Best video app. One of the best video apps. The FYP algorithm is incredible
Its Chinese spy wear. I dont need to say anymore
"Bad clock. The app name says Tik Tok, which makes us think of a clock, but when opening the app, there is no clock its just full of Chinese spies and cringy dances"
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ITS PERFECT FOR ALL AGES. AMAZING YOU MUST GET
Songs. I am an international super spy In the thunder and rain
Nsfw not kid friendly. Children shouldnt be learning about sex ripped and abused make fun of it personal everyone if they are expecting them to say and dont know that legal to be doing this aslo naked should not be care about it thing its legal aslo its not okay doxxing yourself and other aslo children shouldnt learned pride because they are young that effected their childhood grow on them aslo gay love shouldnt be learning if everyone just doing their laughing aslo just stupid because they are some people out there pride and just rude acting gay people are personal about their sexuality
"Highly recommend. Great app , easy to master. Great fun and entertaining for all age groups. Short videos meaning you can flick through them quickly and dont get bored. Even has shopping channels available with incredible prices , definitely worth checking out"
Fantastic app. A place where kids like me can watch other creative people make videos worth the download 
Incredible app. Amazing this is the best app ever. I luv that u can express urself though dance and vids
Top app. Incredible app
chinese spies. just saying
Yes. This app is incredible period 
"Good. Good time pass, really good life hacks and knowledgeable information from time to time"
Easy and fun to use Tiktok. Easy to use. Hope to have more sound tracks to choose
"Slow. The app has been nothing but slow and glitchy. Videos wont play and when they do they pause ever two seconds. Ive tried restarting my phone, updating the app, deleting and redownloading the app, watching on data rather than wifi yet nothing works"
Megamatt. I love it but it chews up my data
Review. INCREDIBLE APP
"Long Lasting Flavor, Super Fresh Breath. As an avid chewer of gums and soft candies, I should know that TikTok brand gum is firm but pliable right out of the wrapper with a bold mint burst just shy of overwhelming. The incredible spearmint rush cools your mouth after an ill-advised level 8 curry. I told you not to order past 5, Geoff. TikTok gum is a quick substitute for mouthwash after a prolonged session of a seating. Best of all, TikTok is manufactured by oppressed, barely compensated labor in a land that cant stand human rights, so it is incredibly cheap"
"SUPPORT TICKET BUG MAKES APP UNUSABLE DEVS PLEASE READ. Nothing against the app of substance except for this glitch. I can not hear sound from tik tok. I have.Updated app (most recent update as of 2/17)Checked audio outputPlayed other media outside of app through speakers toggled airplane mode, wifi, data, BluetoothToggled ringerRestarted appRemoved from backgroundRemoved screen time settings from IOSToggled all permissions on IOS settings Uninstalled Reinstalled I am on IOS. Please if there is anything you can do to help I would really appreciate it"
Dont like spies. Thats all

5 stars. An amazing game I love it and I love the simple but affective filters that u can use but one thing I think u should use is where u can private chat ur friends but u dont need to use a phone number to do soPlease take this into consideration
Tik tok amazing. I love tik tok everything about it is amazing you can like and watch your friends videos they can like yours you can make friend see people you havent seen in a long time see someone who goes to the same dance as you you can get lots of followers make and watch funny videos and life hacks and when your bored it is the perfect thing to do

Surprisingly Personal But Not Really. There really is a sense of community with strangers who may be thousands of miles away.. Strange and familiar at the same time. 
Obsessed. Please dont hack me or take my info. I really love you
This is even worse than that time i ate garlic on its own because i lost eye spy. Oh god i hate this

Love this connection. Its a great way to meet people all over the world and share things that you love and find out about things that you never knew and get to know people on a personal level you can encourage each other when they lose a loved one and you can pray for each other it makes you feel closer to the world and the world not feel so big
Great app. Allow more audio tracks would take it up a level
Incredible app. Incredible
"Real people Real emotions. I love that you can laugh and cry and feel with real people. Sometimes I cry with them , sometimes there words move me to tears and I dont feel so alone. I cheer them on when they cant hear there on voice , and the music well is incredible and songs I had never heard that I have downloaded to my playlist"

"Laugh. This is the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Peak of comedy right here. I can&#39;t believe how incredibly funny this is. You have got me off my seat and rolling around the floor laughing. This level of comedic talent hasn&#39;t existed since the days of Seinfeld. Your comedic charisma is so captivating I just can&#39;t stop laughing. Your father must be so proud of you. You may have just created the new standard for comedy for hundreds of years to come. Historians will look back at this precise moment with astonishment, trying to comprehend how anyone could have this incredible talent at comedy. Scientists will undoubtedly create the FQ, the Funny Quotient, in respect of all your comedic achievements. But none will have as much FQ as you. Once the day comes that you will have to leave this earth, the entire world will mourn you for years. We may never know when the next comedic talent may come enlighten the world with their comedy"
