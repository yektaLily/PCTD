"What privacy?. A truly flawed and pathetic data privacy policy. You really cant get out of Spotify tracking or selling your data. I pay for their service per month. Its time for Spotify (and others) to pay a monthly fee to subscribers for the use of their personal data, or offer complete opt out"
"Great music, awful privacy violations. I pay spotify monthly, but they still collect and sell my personally identifiable information. There seems to be no way to opt out of this in the app. I will be canceling and moving to a different service that doesnt secretly spy on me"
"Data Privacy. Im deleting the app because Spotify tracks me too much. I can tell from the ads that they know when Im driving, when Im doing homework, or when Im doing something else. I tried turning off location and microphone access, but the app still knows. I dont like it and its creepy. I also get ads because I dont have premium, which is fine. But I dont like the number of offensive/controversial ads I keep getting for gambling and contraception. Again, deleting the app. Its a shame because I do like the music"
"Id Give it a SIX, until I found out about. spotifystats.com. Data theives. So sad. Did you ACTUALLY READ spotifystats.com Privacy Policy?? I cant even find my own spotify data without connecting to that sketcky as all get out website. That info is ours, just because I didnt read Spotifys lengthy eula this is what you get. Sketchy, what else is your company doing??? Bye, enjoy my data"
"Violation of Privacy. Ive used and loved Spotify for years. Wonderful study tool, but recently it has been extremely glitchy which had me considering canceling my subscription. Then I learned that Spotify had received the rights to listen in on users? What? Spotify has no right to listen in on me and my surroundings to gain information on my whereabouts and personality. Thats violation of privacy in my book. Goodbye subscription, goodbye Spotify. Very disappointed"
Privacy. If Spotify cared about user privacy it would get 5 stars
Spotify forcing Paid Customers to Allow Tracking Bad. I am not quite sure why Apple has approved a new feature on the Spotify App that forces Paid Customers to allow tracking under the heading You are in Control. Apple is now colluding with Spotify to Track Customers. If Apple is the gate keeper for reviewing and approving these apps why did they approve this new feature that DOES NOT GIVE US THE OPTION TO SAY NO TO TRACKING. INSTEAD THE APP YOU HAVE TO TURN THE APP OFF AND BACK ON TO GET RID OF THIS CONSTANT ANNOYING POP UP FEATURE. APPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED THIS INVASION OF PRIVACY. SIMILAR TO ALL OTHER FEATURES APPLE HAS REQUIRED APPS TO ASK FOR PERMISSION AND ALLOW THE CUSTOMERS TO SAY NO OR YES. TO opt in or out. Now with Spotify we the customers are NOT GIVEN the choice in Spotify pop up Tracking Notifications. INSTEAD IT WANT YOU TO FIRST OPT IN THE. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO TRY AND OPT OUT. I DONT CARE WHAT YOU FORCE FREE CUSTOMERS TO DO IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY SPOTIFY GIVING ADD FILLED MUSIC. I however DO CARE that IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT WE ARE PAYING SPOTIFY FOR ADD FREE MUSIC AND CONTENT. NOW We ARE FOCED TO ALLOW TRACKING. THIS IS WRONG AND SPOTIFY AND APPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR APPROVING THIS INVASION OF CUSTOMERS PRIVACY IN A VERY DECEPTIVE MANNER OF CONTROL

"Stop default public sharing - let users set privacy. Like the app, hate the way Spotify forces default privacy to sharing activity. Even if you set it to private, Spotify changes your privacy settings back to public sharing. Seriously Spotify- those are not the value of a company that respects privacy. Change that setting to respect privacy like every other legitimate company"
Privacy policy changes. Spotify is changing its privacy policy so it can use your mic and listen to you. Time to deactivate and delete
Selling my data?. Worried about Spotifys personal data usage and data sharing. Just saw a list that had them near the top on sharing data with third parties. Might have to switch back to Apple. Hate to see something like this in an App I also have to pay for
"Dodgy ads that grab data?. Why is the government working with Spotify to make playlists? Dont they have better things to do? Clicked on find out more and frankly didnt find out much more. Saw the Revoke Access button at the bottom of the screen which told me that Id have to go into my account to revoke access to my account for the Government/Spotify app. Honestly? For clicking, find out more? Thats just creepy. I havent time to find out why this happened or mess about revoking access for apps that I didnt explicitly give consent for access to in the first place. It was much faster to ditch Spotify"
"Issues. I hate that this app tracks you with your your permission and it uses your contact info and more like facial idinity and it uses your personal information and it is trying to get peoples information without confermino it is ok to do so it also uses usage data and identifiers as well and other things to track you as well like search history and more like finaisail plans and other plans low your data plan your cell phone plan and more and there are lots of adds also they use lots of third parties to track you by using your contact information your search history and your location and money financial plan and other scketchy third party information and I think they should ask your permission before they get all of your information and if they dont have your permission then they should keep it private. Also, I think that it should not take up so much i phone data. And not play so many adds and they should have a plan that includes Nba tv youtube tv Permount plus Disney plus and MLB tv and sling. I hate the limit of 6 skips and other than these major issues the app is a good great amazing ausome app for music. I also hate that it uses app digonises to track you. I hate that most apps for music like YouTube, I heart, Pandora, Spotify, and prime music use third party information to track you. I think this is really frustrating. I also think that Spotify could do a better job about playing adds that are not stupid movie trailers that some people can care less about. I dont like any of the adds on Spotify except for the basketball and other sports adds and holiday adds. Please fix these bugs and glitches and majure. Thanks. I also hate the shoe adds and food adds and pet adds and other adds that are not interested in like the toy adds I like the music adds though"

Have that option please fix this thanks otherwise I really like and love this music app it is the best app in the world. Thanks for making it great. Also, I would recommend making it 18 skips an hour"
"Honda and Spotify love violating our privacy. Its so creepy how on my radio in my car I listen to country music and the Spotify app without me ever listening to country on their app, somehow knew I like country music. My assumption is that the guys at Spotify figured out how to use the voice recorder and a little bit of neural networks to actually record for key words when they use your voice recording hardware without openly acknowledging the fact that they do so. Its so creepy how people talk about Facebook ads and Alexa listening to us without our consent and yet the application could not possibly have known that I enjoy country without violating my privacy. (Your privacy). Strange, very very peculiar, indeed. I mean my background is only in computer science so I mean for what its worth I suppose mine is a working theory about privacy of the average user. Amazing App"
"Privacy features lacking. Music is a personal experience and if Spotify is going to maintain a follower type platform they need to implement the unfollow/block option. So many users are requesting this, why has this not been added after years of requests?"
"Privacy. I absolutely love Spotify, but I really really hate that your family plan is only for family in the same household. Not only is it a privacy violation, but its a stupid policy. Netflix offers a family plan and they dont have that ridiculous policy. Your platform is amazing and lots of artist are featured and have the desire to be on here, but dont forget competition is what keeps a company great. If I hear someone else offers the same quality of music with no nonsense to it, Ill be more than happy to give my business to the best business. Overall 4 stars for your incredible platform, but you lost a star for whoever made such a foolish rule"
"Forced Info Sharing?. I love my Spotify, but every time I try to use it I get a pop-up that I cant get past asking me to allow tracking to receive relevant Spotify promotions and marketing. The only choice is to CHOOSE. Where is the button to deny or choose NOT to share. I pay $100 a year for this app. Why cant I say NO?"
"Unaware of malicious share groups. This app has a lot of options that can be a serious problem to your devices from people who take control your devices. And actually modify the Spotify intellectual property. This is insane to be not allowed to unsubscribe or delete the app off your device. I found that they use old apps to execute there control over your identity and the knowledge of certain personal info that you think would be safe. How are they using my device after it&#39;s deleted is not sharing , I wanna know who I&#39;m dealing with"
"Private Profile. I really like this app. Its nice that the only price for listening to all my favorite songs is watching ads, like how great is that. I really appreciate how easy it is to make albums and I like that Spotify will recommend songs they feel would nicely compliment the vibe of the album. One thing I would like for Spotify to update however, is the privacy of your profile. I would like the option to make my profile private and be able to accept/decline people who want to follow me like on other social media platforms. Privacy is a really important thing for me and I love listening to music on this app but Im more cautious now of which playlists are public, knowing that anyone could see them. Thank you for everything Spotify, just would like an update that would make a private profile available "
"Block feature??. Id raise my rating by a star if there was a block feature. I want my friends to be able to listen with me, without having to worry about specific people who I dont trust being able to track my listening habits. It would mean a lot if Spotify could support my privacy to this small extent"
Hi. I enjoy using your app but you might wish to add extra security because Ive had trouble with hackers and from reading the data they were trying to use Spotify in order to track me by imbedding tracking in the music images of which I believe are copyrighted keeping my comment anonymously unnamed because Im formerly a DV victim. Thanks once again. Not sure why this isnt sending through
STOP selling MY data. Ive been a paying customer for close to 5 years. Spotify has continued to track more data every year even though Im paying for the service. Dont you love it when free services justify privacy invasion to keep their service free while others make you pay with cash AND your privacy. Stop pushing podcasts and audiobooks on me. New audiobooks should not take up 1/5 of my Home Screen when Ive never listened to one. Im leaving Spotify the moment Apple Music reaches feature and UI parity
Fully private account feature. Love this app and everything about it but I was wondering if you guys could include a feature where you can make your Spotify account completely private. I know you have the option to make your playlist secret and have a private listening session but I think users should have the option to make their accounts fully private if they choose to especially for privacy and safety reasons because I dont want random strangers or other users to have the right to listen to my personal playlists because what I listen to is my personal music preferences and I feel that I should be able to keep it that way I hope you guys will consider this option and implicate it into the app thank you 
Privacy. I dont like that Spotify can use your mic to listen to what is happening in the room in order to pick the next song I am going to delete app
"Privacy violations. Im using the app on iPhone, and only played videos on my iPad which doesnt even have Spotify installed. Somehow the Spotify app installed on my phone is able to track the browsing history and my YouTube playlist from my iPad to make a recommendation on podcast. This is unacceptable"
"Skim personal info for no reason. To register they forced me to state my gender and my age, why?Im paying a subscription but its still full of adverts and spam, Spotify promoted music appears above my own likes / playlists etc. The user experience is rotten unless you care about using commercial playlists. Like you cant link from a track thats playing to the full album or directly to the artist, I just get pushed towards playlists. Google music is a lot better. Will go back to that"
"Data Mining. Ive had Spotify for years, until I cancelled and deleted the app because Apple kindly pointed out what personal information the Spotify App was stealing from me. Why do you want my browsing history?"
Privacy/ dont want others to connect to it. I wish there was a setting that would allow the account holder to control devices that connect to ur Spotify..like for say they have to put in a pin or confirm email/phone to connect other. Or even to keep it from showing publicly on WiFi etc. like a hidden setting maybe???? Im only giving 4 stars cause of this and if it had this then it would be 5 stars no doubt...other than that I have a premium account and love it more than pandora cause its truly  a lot nicer tbh. (I tried both in comparison) if Spotify comes out with this setting for say than that would be great
"A bit pricey but worth the download. I have all that I need on Spotify in terms of listening to Podcasts and listening to Music all in one except theres no videos which is perfect for me because it allows me to take a break from using YouTube. Nothing against them mI love watching YouTube however, I found it to be a huge idol in my life so I wanted to have something that would have some podcasts I listen to from my favorite YouTubers and songs on there. Such as RuslanKD, Desiring God, GotQuestions.org, and etc. Which essentially killing two birds with one stone. The two things I believe Spotify could do better is make it easier to make payments on the all accessing the plans youve purchased as well as keeping track of what you spent on the app instead of going on their website to do it. Another thing that Spotify can improve on is if they could allow more options to personalize your profile more like with a Bio, Prompt, (Whats your favorite artist or song?) customize background picture, and etc. I thought that would be a fun touch to personalize your profile more like you can do on other platforms. One final thing I would like Spotify to also increase what you can do in your settings as for as security goes like Twi Factor Authorization for an example. In general it would be beneficial to me at least to have more security options to choose from to feel comfortable with having my account safety secured. Keeping track of whats going on and who is trying to get into my account. By the way havent had no problems, but thought I would write this out for future references. Hope everike has a wonderful day Spotifying anf God bless"
"reads your phone data. just so everyone knows, spotify must have access to all your music files. a lot of stuff i exclusively listened to on apple music has started to appear on my spotify curated playlists, it HEAVILY interferes with my listening experience. if i wanted to listen to what i was in 2014, i would have stayed with apple music. awful. just awful. might as well go back to apple at this point"
"UPDATE FORCES NEW LOGIN METRICS . Have the Premium prescription. Spotify asking for more personal information and pressuring you into third-party data/personal mining (READ: Updated Personal Information, locale, etc.) ... WHY?Hot fix or role back latest update.Cancellation of this user, imminent"
"Unaware of malicious share groups. This app has a lot of options that can be a serious problem to your devices from people who take control your devices. And actually modify the Spotify intellectual property. This is insane to be not allowed to unsubscribe or delete the app off your device. I found that they use old apps to execute there control over your identity and the knowledge of certain personal info that you think would be safe. How are they using my device after it&#39;s deleted is not sharing , I wanna know who I&#39;m dealing with. I enjoy Spotify. It&#39;s pod casts look interesting. As u figured I haven&#39;t really used too much of Spotify, but will eventually learn more of it on my laptop , PC &amp; iPhone. Not too into the sharing things with total strangers. I seen that it must be enjoyable to meet ppl on Spotify. That&#39;s my feedback"
Spotify review. I love Spotify so much I just really wish you could use it without it taking your data
Privacy setting. It would be nice not to have to go to the privacy setting and turn it off every time listen to Spotify. Other than that I really like Spotify. Wish this was a one time setting until I chose to share my music taste with every one
"No privacy. Ive been using Spotify premium for years now and if theres something I dont like about it, its the fact that we cant block people. I used to publish all of my playlists but now that my ex lover found my account and followed me, I deleted them. Its just really frustrating because you cant do nothing if someone doesnt want to unfollow you. I dont care if strangers listen to my playlists because I dont know them personally but when it comes to the people I know in real life... It just feels like I have no privacy. Ive been thinking about creating another account but it would be a waste of time to search for every single song Ive been listening to during the last years. It would be great if you could find a solution"
"Privacy. Still cant block followers? Spotify, you move had ample time to get this done since when it was first brought up. What the heck"
"Invasion of privacy. I would uninstall this app if there was a viable competitor. I want to listen to Spotify on my computer, but despite the app on my phone being closed they are invading my phones OS and forcibly changing the volume on my phone to match that of my computer.  This has me speechless, as best I can tell theres no way to turn this feature off, and I certainly didnt opt in. Truly a terrible customer experience"
"Privacy. Amazing service but violating privacy act ,as tracking actions through the programs inside cell phone hope some enforcement controls Your Company"
"Terrible design for users. Spotify keeps pushing unwanted displays to even their premium users with no ability for preferences or modification of what music and shows are thrust all over your home screen. For the ridiculous amount of data tracking Spotify has on its users, you think they would at least let them customize what their home screen shows them"
Public behavioural data. I wish this app provided just the service of music streaming without making it a social media platform. I dont want followers or people being able to track what a listen to. I literally dont see why this option isnt available
"It needs a blocking feature. I use this app everyday and I love it, however, I wish Spotify would implement the ability to remove/block people who follow your account. When blocked that person would automatically unfollow you and unable to see your playlists/listening activity. Perhaps even unable to search for your account after blocked as well.Users should have privacy if they wish and control over who sees their activity"
Spotify review. I really like the fact I get my own privacy and I have the control. Theres no interruptions or advertising
"Great App, Shrewd Business. I love Spotify, always have. Their premium service is great, but I think its a little shrewd that they disable the majority of features that make Spotify Spotify for mobile users unless they have premium. I think its unfair - because unless you have premium, theres nothing to distinguish it from Pandora (in fact I think at that point Id rather have Pandora, it at least has decent suggestions). I also hate that some albums, while still accessible through certain avenues, have been posted but are unable to be played. The content is all there - but the users just cant enjoy it. I realize that there are some privacy concerns with it, and that artists are free to post and take down what they want, but I think it just  inhibits the artists and takes away from the diversity of the platform. If the mobile app werent so neutered without premium, Id give this app 5 stars. But again - I understand why Spotify did it. People are on their phones more, phones are more convenient than computers to carry around and listen to music. They know that nowadays people will rush to pay for convenience, and theyre using that truth to get more money out of their customers. Very shrewd, but I respect it. I would give my fellow viewers a run down of the app, but lets be honest - we all know what Spotify is at this point. If youre reading the reviews, youre probably not reading them to figure out what Spotify is - you want to know the dirt about it. I can tell you only that unless you already have premium (which you can only buy online via a computer or web browser) youll be incredibly disappointed"
Personal data. The service is good- I just dont appreciate the terms of service- unfortunately Im not aware of other solid options in which my data isnt used for their benefit
Locked out of account. Spotify locked me out of my account for an hour or two. I was afraid my data mightve been hacked or password stolen. Watch out for your data privacy
"Privacy. Great for streaming music, terrible for privacy"
i dont trust you guys. i got a pop up basically saying can i see your personal data and info for ads and i said no and half way through a song i got an ad about protecting my data from companies trying to steal it lol you play too muchbtw you took a great song app and destroyed it with ads just like soundcloud im just waiting for the day that leaving to app while playing music is a month subscription
"Removing the app. I just removed Spotify because I do not want to run across misinformation on COVID-19 through voices such as Joe Rogan. Frankly, I can listen to my favorite music on platforms that do not include those voices and that is what I prefer.One more thing I dislike about Spotify now that Ive read more about its privacy rating is its intent to gather non-public, private information on its users. For having downloaded this app without paying attention to that bit, I blame myself. Lesson learned"
"Needs a Spotify for education. I teach a rock history course, and I love all that Spotify offers I am a premium member. Many of my students (ages 12-14) openly admit they use Spotify on their personal devices at home. Our school will not allow Spotify to be used on school devices, due to terms of service, even with parent consent. The issue the district has in the data mining and student privacy issue. If Spotify were to offer a subscription, even with a site fee, that protected minors from these issues. It would be very resourceful in education. I have heard there has been litigation elsewhere in regards to apps being available in schools that have similar terms of service.I am wishing Spotify could do something like this so students can learn more about music and history"
"Careful. They tell you right up front they track you. And since they fully support misinformation chances are youre already screwed. Hopefully you can get in on a class action lawsuit eventuallyAlso Spotify, FYI, free speech is NOT protected when spreading misinformation. Its in the Constitution and has been upheld by the Supreme Court(Gaertz v Welch Inc. (1974)). Dont yall have lawyers that know this stuff???"
"Improve security and privacy. i love spotify and it has always been my main music stream platform, but the security needs to be more secured to prevent hackers from getting into other peoples accounts. my premium account was hacked and someone was just hijacking my profile to listen to their own music. i wasnt even notified that someone had signed into my account using a different device please do enhance the security"
Reading my text. Every time some fast food or corporation is mentioned in a text I proceeded to get an advertisement on Spotify related to that companyIts too personal and invasive I dont want Spotify in my text messages period
Good app but it needs more security. I love Spotify and the Repeat shuffle playlist feature along with the top songs playlist of each passing year. But I really wish that Spotify would care about the safety and privacy of each account. My account got hacked yesterday from someone in the Ukraine. This startled me and which I had to reset and log out of every device with Spotifys log out feature. Please fix this soon
"Why do you need all of that private information that you track????. Ive been a customer for years, and to find out how much information you keep is shocking. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for you all to have that detailed information. Reminds me of Google"
Spotify has Privacy Issues. They keep placing trash artists within my library without my permission
"Premium for Family HACKED for the FOURTH time. Cmon Spotify I pay enough money that surely you can protect ME, your PAYING customer We pay for Family and three of us, within a few months, have had to change our passwords because our account has been hacked. The worse was when it was my young daughters The trash the thieving, ignoramus listened to was a full out assault not only on my childs ears, but mine as well. Even more aggravating, it canNOT be deleted from RECENTLY PLAYED AND still tries to suggest the same nonsense. Thank GOD they have the explicit toggle switch otherwise it would have been able to play the same rubbish Good luck trying to get customer service to do anything Bunch of talking heads that they are, going in circles because all they do is give a pat answer WITHOUT actually reading the correspondence. Ridiculous The company surely doesnt care if I, only ONE customer, would cancel. $14.99 a month is NOTHING to them SPOTIFY FIX YOUR SECURITY YOU probably sell our information on the dark web Better yet, with the poor security you have, you just freely give it away Thank you very much for thatEdit: I forgot to mention that a search within my own music doesnt work. Even if one word is typed within the search bar, say more for example, it says I have nothing within my playlist for that search word, when in fact I do, multiple songs that have more within the title and even as the first word"
"Tracking data & sharing across apps. Really like Spotify, I moved from Apple Music. However now that I see the tracking and sharing of my data across apps, Im giving them 90 days to stop, after that its back to Apple Music"
Stupid push to change the privacy settings. Today i had my screen blocked by notifications pushing me to change my privacy settings so the app can track me. What a stupid thing to do to customers who already paying a monthly subscription. Is it a way to bypass Apple ? Switching over to Deazer
"Have you reads their terms and conditions?. Over Spotify. Its just another piece of spyware, like Facebook, google and the rest. Try reading the Ts and Cs youve already signed up to. Might take an hour, or three. You are just there to have your data sold.Its  another nice idea ruined by becoming a near monopoly service. The search for a music provider who isnt  near spyware continues"
"Missing 2 FA and extra security. I love Spotify to death and its hands down one of the best music streaming apps out there to date, however; its missing the security of personal information and overall security in general My account has been logged into so many times by others around the world who I have no clue who they are. The emails they send out about your account being logged into doesnt even help out or sometimes I dont even get a email. They need to add a 2FA and a way to see which devices are connected to your account. Im paying for a subscription like others for a reason and we are getting taken advantage of by hackers. Im tired of finding random playlist on my recently played section or my music skipping randomly to a artist Ive never listened to"
Creepy and no privacy features. Had to delete Spotify because of the creepy podcasts and invasive tracking. I value privacy and truth. Spotify doesnt cut it. Decided to go with Apple Music instead
Doesnt support privacy. Signing up and it doesnt allow me to finish until I DISCONNECT MY VPN. Haha what a joke. Huge red flag. back to Apple Music. Also add an undisclosed option for gender. We know your ads will target women with parenting and baby ads like why would someone (uninvolved in that lifestyle) want to hear that. But I can already see you dont value privacy at all. You track track track and sell users private info. Im unimpressed even before touching the site. I Was going to give this platform a try but Ill stick to whats not broken
Dishonest. Spotify blocks access to the Joe Rogan Experience with expressvpn. Guess they need to sell your data to pay for it. No thanks
"Forcing me to click Choose for app tracking is bad PR. I was greeted with a new tracking feature to allow tracking. It said I could go change it in settings later. The only choice I was given in the window was to Choose it. Dirty pool Spotify  Ive turned it off and stopped using Spotify. When my kids graduate and get their own accounts, Im closing it"
Too much data use-age. My downloaded songs keep disappearing and then downloading again killing my data plan....Thinking of getting rid of Spotify as its using to much data
Dont do Spotifys surveys. Extremely invasive and personal survey questions
"Forces me to make devices vulnerable by blocking VPN. I use a VPN on my devices to protect my privacy. Even if I use a VPN server in my own city, Spotify blocks the connection. Makes the whole experience rather annoying"
"Data. Really loved Spotify, I was able to play all my downloaded music with the cellular data turned off. But the new update made it now where you have to have cellular data on in order to play any music, even if downloaded"
"See what devices are logged in. Spotify overall is a great app but my family has noticed that random russian songs start playing, so we believe that our accounts keep getting hacked. There should be a feature to see what devices are logged into your account as another privacy feature. Random songs start playing from other devices. If you guys could add this privacy feature it would make things a whole lot easier and less stressful"
Please bring the option to remove/block followers. Cant believe how Spotify still hasnt implemented this option even after receiving thousands of requests from users for privacy concerns?
"Using because of content I like. This app does not allow me to track shows I watch in an easy manner nor does it allow me to download shows automatically. It may be a premium feature. I only have it because Parcast has content I really enjoy, but I am thinking of not using Spotify and foregoing listening to that content. I do not believe a company should be able to hold us hostage"
"Deletes my songs. I have Spotify premium, and every couple of days it decides to delete all my downloaded songs. Meaning I have to use my data to stream my music"
False choice-shame on you. A youre in control to choose tracking and marketing messages has appeared on my iPhone Spotify App. in fact the only choice is to choose....or switch off and choose a competitor which I am now looking into. I refuse to be forced to choose
Cheap attempt at bypassing apple privacy. Youre supposed to give people the choice to be tracked or not you made it as difficult as poss. Pro tip for other consumers: if you get the pop up you can bypass it by closing the app and opening it up again
"Needs more security features. Although I dont see that the developers are active here, Im going to write a review anyways since tying to give feedback on their website is a joke. My account was recently hacked and I got the dreaded Your account has just been accessed blah blah blah, if you did not initiate this access reset blah blah blah. So no biggie I caught the email pretty quickly, went and changed my password and did all the recommended security steps. But while I was in my account I realized how much information this hacker could have accessed in just a short time, not only my full name, but my maiden name thats in my email (my bad there), my date of birth and my full address I know you can probably find all of this while digging online but I think Spotify should be better at protecting your information. How about some 2-factory identification? Anything else to protect users that pay you a premium every month"
"Zero Privacy. You cant use this app with a VPN, and they share every oz of your data with anyone they can"
Privacy. Not enough options to keep some more things private
"Lack of privacy. This app is missing a crucical safety/ privacy feature: removing/ blocking followers.  I have a stalker that is following my account and I have no access to block them from my account. I reached out to customer support and the best they could do was to create a new account and theyd transfer over my info to the new account. Why do I have to move and go through all that hassle when it would be way easier to CREATE A REMOVE/ BLOCK FOLLOWER feature. There have been several forums over the past years from Spotify users that have complained and wanted this feature to be implemented due to stalker exes, people who have harassed them. Facebook, Instagram have caught up with this safety/privacy feature. Its time for Spotify to do the same"
"VPN support. The app is great and my VPN (expressVPN) works with it for the most part, until I try to launch The Joe Rogan Experience. Then I guess your privacy isnt that important to you. No thanks spotify"
"Mobile app is a little restricting. Spotify is great and you can find lots of different music, however the mobile app doesnt allow you to change your playlist covers or view/change your personal information (e.g. email, gender, D.O.B, etc) on your phone. Also, Ive noticed that on the PC app you can view what your friends are listening to and the date that a song was added to your playlist. I think it would be great if we could see these things on the mobile app too for people that dont always have access to a laptop/computer. Despite this its an overall great app &amp; I use it everyday. "
"Loss of privacy. Spotify shares music history and other info between two SEPARATE accounts if you connect them to the same Alexa account, even if you use two separate Alexa devices"
"Needs Siri support. I get this is probably on Apples end because they want you to use the over priced, difficult to navigate, limited and glitchy version of this app. Me: Hey Siri, shuffle my music on Spotify.Siri: Ill need permission to access your data on Spotify.Me: Wait what? *completely rethinks this review*The app is perfect"
"The app is my everything. However. Been on the spotify premium kick for a decade (speaks volumes to my affinity to the streaming service) but theres two things that Ive noticed them slipping on:1) the algorithm used to alway include new, fresh music once an album or playlist came to an end. Now I feel like they recycle the same 12 songs and its driving me NUTS  Its not even the same 12 artists, its the exact. same. songs. Im listening to a relatively similar genre of music, but since Q4 last year Ive noticed this getting worse and worse to where I needed to say something about it.2) anyone whos been a subscriber since 2012-2015 can remember when Spotify had the DM feature so you can share tracks/albums with friends through the app itself. #1 why did this go away in the first place and #2 how has it not come back yet?  Instead were having to export/share via iMessage or whatever, and its an unnecessary clunkiness. I dont want Spotify to at all become a social media platform or something like venmo where there are feeds you can see publicly who is sharing what, but why cant they bring back the feature to simply share amongst users?  Are there that many bots and weirdos that this would compromise security/privacy?Thats it for now. Listen to Arlo Parks"
"Major issues. I love Spotify, have used it for years, but have some major concerns that make me consider switching, or at least dropping my subscription. First, its a regular experience that downloaded songs will play until 3-4 seconds in and stop, not pausing in the app, and requiring me to manually skip to continue playing. Given I like to listen to music while driving or doing hands free work, this is unacceptable. Additionally, the space usage by the app is problematic. I had 20 GB of music saved and, to free up some storage, unsaved multiple playlists. The space assigned to the app in the storage settings lessened, but no space on my phone was freed; somehow the app allows the data to remain, though I can no longer use it"
"Love it. I sincerely dont know what I would do if I didnt have Spotify to use every single day, music is in my blood, so to have it be so easily accessible and affordable is incredible. Thank you"
"Increasingly distracting and off base. Tracking. Tracking is an invasion of users privacy. Tracking must stopThe Spotify app is increasingly cluttered with stuff I dont want to see or hear. Constant suggestions of songs that are way off base from what I want to listen to. I cant tell if the music algorithms are just very poorly crafted or if it is deliberate. The songs suggested as being similar to the songs I like are not even in the same genre. They are so far off-base it is just annoying.I find Spotify continuously tries to guide me away from what I want to listen to towards some supposedly popular music that I find lifeless and dull. The algorithms they use seem to be focused on removing diversity in music and moving towards some bland commonality. I doesnt matter how many times I skip or hide songs that I dont want they seem to have an unlimited supply of more of the same they want to force feed me. The algorithms must certainly be able to see a pattern in the songs I have liked and continuously try to guide me away from that. Eventually there will be just one culturally bland playlist for all, whether you like it or not. So what is the objective behind this? Is it to annoy listeners?"
"Library organization massacred. Twelve hours after updating Spotify, it had used over 2 GB of cellular data. How it managed that overnight, when my phone was locked, is beyond me  I have cellular downloads off, and cellular streams set to low quality. Most of my music is already downloaded also. So now I have 1.8 GB of data left for the remaining 18 days of my billing cycle and Spotify has had access to my cellular data revoked completely. Spotify team: FIX THIS. The issues this app has are inexcusable when I pay monthly for the service.FROM MY PREVIOUS REVIEW:The Spotify apps fairly recent update completely ruined the way the Library tab is organized. Before, I could organize by Playlists/Artists/Albums and easily find content on an alphabetical list. Now all my playlists, followed artists, and liked albums are thrown together in one big long list with the latest played at the top. With the exception of folders, all my organizational structure to my library has been erased due to this change. Now instead of organized lists on straightforward tabs, the interface is a cluttered mix of content types; filters exist, but its an extra step and not even that is implemented well. This has knocked another star off this apps rating for me only two left until I switch to Apple Music. All I can hope at this point is that the desktop and phone versions of the app are untouched by this mess, because I use them far more for music than I do my iPad. SPOTIFY TEAM: SAVE IT FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH AND GET THIS GARBAGE OUT OF HERE. We pay for this service  stop removing features. My existing review from a previous version starts here: I have Spotify Premium and love it. That being said, the app does have some issues that can be annoying rather frequently and I would very much like to see fixed. First off, be warned that your app may crash if you add a lot of songs to your queue. It is even more likely to crash if you try to reorder your queue when there are quite a few tracks in it. The worst part is that upon restarting the app, the current song is maintained but the queue is wiped clean. This is seriously irritating for an app that I pay a monthly subscription fee for. This was never a problem for me in the past, so it would seem to be an issue with a newer update. (Spotify team: please fix) This app is basically useless when offline or with low/unreliable cellular signal. I have quite a lot of music downloaded to save cellular data usage, but even then I often cannot access it offline (unless its in my recents on the Library tab) because the list views wont load even the offline-only content As much as I despise apps that have large caches, I really want the listings for downloaded content to be retained in the app. Best case scenario, I can view all music I have saved and playlists but just not play anything that isnt downloaded and have that just be greyed-out but bare minimum I need access to my downloaded content, even if the artist photos are blank when offline or something like that. With it operating as it is now, I have my favorite music in iCloud Music Library and downloaded both there and Spotify because I cannot rely on Spotify when offline for downloads but can with the built-in Music app. The data is there this shouldnt be difficult to fix. Another issue I have with the Spotify app is the shuffle algorithm, which is absolutely abysmal most of the time. A playlist can have music from dozens of artists and yet it plays three songs in a row from a single artist Theres no reason it should do that. I can pretty much guarantee at this point that songs most recently added to a playlist have shuffle priority, which is fine for an optional behavior but not for the only shuffle option. (I dont want to hear all my new music back-to-back when I hit shuffle on a playlist I just want it to randomly shuffle everything evenly, and yes I mean RANDOM) The issue where the last song in the queue would disappear visually used to be limited to iPhone and absent on iPad. Awhile back it was fixed on iPhone (at least for me) but now its on my iPad This doesnt break the Spotify experience, but its a major pain and really needs to be fixed unfortunately since its an iPad issue it probably wont be for awhile, because the tablet version of Spotify seems to be a very low priority for the company unfortunately. (I use Spotify on my iPad fairly frequently, and I know Im not alone in that) Every once in awhile issues show up in the app, and sometimes theyre solved quickly but often they take awhile to be fixed. With this current version, the aforementioned issues are all I really have to complain about, aside from a few other minor details such as minor errors in the UI. Overall I really love Spotify, and I highly recommend it if you listen to more than just a couple albums on repeat all the time; in fact, even if thats you Spotify can help you branch out and discover great new music you otherwise may have never experienced. The free version is very limited, and a lot of reviews Ive seen here reference that very strongly and angrily but Spotify is first and foremost a paid service, and without Premium you are going to run into a lot of shortcomings. US$9.99/mo for the standard subscription is a great deal if you buy more than one album per month on average Ive discovered so much great new music with Spotify, thanks to the awesome curated playlists and personalized recommendations"
Spotify review. Spotify is a great app to listen to songs it has  a good reputation but you can get sucked into it and it might waste your data but most apps do that so dont be worried.If you are a serious data saver and you get sucked in then get premium it doesnt waste as much data
"Customer Service is just terrible. It breaks my heart to write this review. I have had my premium account for 6 years. It was hacked last month and my personal information was stolen from the app. My cell phone number, my email, my password. All hacked. My single account was changed to a family account all behind my back. Spotify has no call center. The only method for contacting customer service is through their website via text. It took me 45 minutes to get an answer and that answer was that my information had been stolen. I am heartbroken. My life and soul was in my playlists, and my wedding playlist was in it as well. I no longer feel safe using this platform and you should be aware"
No Way to Make All Playlists Private. This app silently makes all your playlists public without asking you so data miners and marketing companies can sell your data. You can only turn this off for new playlists or one playlist at a time. Im not spending hours going through all my playlists and setting each one to private manually. Its totally unacceptable that my data had probably already been stolen. Thanks Spotify
"Spotify review. I genuinely think that this is a very good app to listen to since there is a vast amount of music with good sound quality. Although I do like this app in many ways, I do think it needs a change such as people that do not have access to premium can download music instead of using their data"
Stop with promiscuous data sharing. This application intentionally or inadvertently shares data with a variety of services including Facebook. I pay for it. Stop lazily using leaky third party SDKs when it compromises my privacy
"What A Shame. I was thinking of switching from Apple Music to Spotify and then I stopped in my tracks. What? No ability to switch between users without logging out and in again? How can a service be so good and so bad all at the same time I don&#39;t know what they are thinking but this discourages people from having a family account or using the service at all. Seriously Spotify, this needs a fix. You can switch accounts on a Fire Stick so why not IOS? Is this an Apple block? Should would like to know"
"Downloading. The worst thing about Spotify is if I download all my songs to my phone so I dont need data to play them, I constantly have to re-download all 1000+ songs Its a little irritating"
Privacy?. They refuse to explain their practices despite multiple requests and specific questions.Switching to Apple Music I guess...Update: found that they explicitly violate even the few promises they did make to me... cancelled premium already. Uninstalling
"Aids Facebook tracking. Instead of a link to Facebook to log in, Spotify uses the Facebook SDK for login and this causes ALL USERS to be tracked by Facebook. Shame on Spotify for not protecting non-Facebook users"
Stupid. Ive used Spotify for years and it still wont let me play songs that Ive downloaded unless I have data. So whats the point of downloading if youre still streaming?
"Spotify big time rules. I cant think of an app thats as user friendly and caters to its audience as much as possible as Spotify. Its social, its personal, its everything one could ask for in a music app"
"need an option to block users. i use spotify every day but it just makes me so uncomfortable that people who are no longer in my life are following me and i don&#39;t want to contact them to tell them to unfollow me for multiple reasons. i don&#39;t want anyone following me because music can be very private and personal to me and i feel like people are looking at what i listen to and judging me. i&#39;ve made all my playlists private but i know that there at least used to be a feature to see what your friends are listening to, and i can&#39;t find the option to not show that anymore. i don&#39;t want to have to create an entirely new account just to get rid of people being able to see things that are personal to me. fix this. "
Sick of having to re-download. I like the ease of use and the variety of music available. I&#39;m sick of having to use an excess of data to re-download my music when Spotify decides to remove it all from offline availability which seems to be happening every few months
"spotify steals data & hates good design. spotifys conjoined-twin relationship with facebook should be seriously concerning to anyone who values an iota of online privacy. now spotify is transforming itself into an ad company so they can make even more money off your personal data. on top of all that, spotifys designers can barely go six months without completely redesigning core aspects of their product. that is called really bad planning and a really cruddy way to support your users. make a good app once and then update the back end for at least a year thats not that long before completely changing the UI again. come on guys. this is just such a terrible way of treating your users.also, for jesus christ superstars sake, MAKE YOUR IPAD APP LOOK DECENT AGAIN. its the fugliest music app on the ipad BY FAR"
"Liberty takers or scammers. I want to listen to a track someone gave me a link to.  However, Spotify has other ideas if I dont have premium.  So, I have to listen to their chosen tracks before I get to the one I want.  So far Ive listened to 3 tracks by people Ive no interest in. I refuse to buy their premium as I very rarely even use Spotify.  This behaviour is bullying and theyre acting like scammers"
"Necessary. I recently had my iPhone stolen and the insurance company replacing it to much longer than expected to resolve and replace my phone.  During the interim, I couldnt download my Spotify premium because I have had it so long that I did not remember any sign in data I went without it for 4 full days... yesterday was day 5 and I missed my music, my playlists, my distraction... so much that I was distracted from everything.  I couldnt focus on my work, conversations, hobbies, anything really Plus I was irritable and short with people I had not needed to be separated from mine prior to this but I definitely dont recommend it I had forgotten how nice it is to have music calming me in my day, and evenings now that Im not employed Id be a lonelier, less happy person without Spotify~Michael Weber"
"blocking. hey, update your privacy settings and allow people to block others its for safety"
"Blocked artists. Great feature on Spotify. Block abusive (Chris Brown, Marlyn Manson, etc) or trash artists (Nickelback), to make Spotify less triggering.I used to be able to view my blocked artists on the Spotify app. I would share with my friends each year this list of canceled artists for fun, But Spotify has removed all of this functionality. In fact, its so bad that now you have to request your tracking privacy ad data (that Spotify shouldnt be keeping anyway, especially for paying members). Terrible"
Offline play. So I have Spotify premium and all my music is downloaded and most of it wont play without my data on
"Innovation at its finest. Spotify has surpassed the initial innovative stage of Apple Music by a mile. At this point its difficult to justify choosing another music streaming service other than Spotify.The addition of the Enhance feature, along with Lyrics being added and the updated algorithm have all proved to add value to an already booming applicationIn order to reach 5 stars, I would suggest for Spotify to increase the privacy of collaborative playlists to the next level by adding a feature only allowing users with a uniquely generated link to add songs to said playlist, in order to restrict stream-generating bots from adding random songs to your playlist.I look forward to the future of Spotify"
Privacy option. I dont want people I dont know or people I do know but dont want following me see what I am listening to. The privacy mode has to be set everyday as it automatically goes off by itself without knowledge. You have done a recent update I believe that notifies when the privacy mode has gone off automatically now so u know when to put back on. But it doesnt always notify or is not working anymore for some reason. Can u please have a permanent privacy option. I believe it is a breach of consumer rights. Ppl should have this option. Thank you
"Customer service is terrible. Spotify refuses to admit fault over what is obviously a security breach on their side. Do yourself a favor and use another service. Ive used Spotify premium for 5 years and customer service made me switch in a matter of a few emails. several Spotify users are currently suffering from ghost playlists and suspicious activity of the exact same nature. Down to the name of the random playlists and account access names are the same from every reported issue Ive seen. I tried to report this and get help but Spotify customer service essentially just blamed me and canceled my account temporally causing me to have to set it all back up and re download thousands of songs and playlists across all my devices even though I had already used the log out of every device option and changed my password. They refused to compensate me for the time I didnt have access to my account that THEY disabled. It was a terrible experience. Do yourself a favor and use Apple Music or pandora. Spotify doesnt care about its customers and their privacy, information or their satisfaction"
Suggestions. First of all Ill start by saying I  enjoy listening to Spotify  music but  could better.Add a free feature for when creating the account to set a KID MODE ( Can turn on and  off with account password required)Just when you think about it Parents wont have to worry if their kids are listening to appropriate music.with this feature you will have more usersSpotify could also  ask for what kind of kid music parents want their kids to listen into 2  options 1 Toddler music2 Kid music My 2 suggestion is  to put a fracture that allows you to lock a certain playlist you want to keep private Privacy is very importantA private playlist  could have a lock code to unlock With these suggestion   Trust me youll have more users thank you for making Spotify
"Cant use it due to disconnecting issues. I pay for Spotify and the app wont connect to the internet very frequently. The rest of the data on my phone works perfectly fine, just not Spotify So frustrating"
"Disappointed. I made the switch from Pandora and SoundCloud to Spotify embarrassingly late. It does really well with bringing me new music. Recently, however, I got an iPhone 13 and love the option of not tracking. It makes me feel like I have more agency. Spotify, please allow me to access my musicthat I PAY forwithout having to Choose something Im actually not interested in"
"Collects too much information on you. This app is great, the only issue I have is that it collects allot of personal information that has nothing to do with playing music"
"They push ads to paid users & track a lot. The music is amazing. But I dont subscribe and pay for the lame and distracting experience of ads, pop ups, announcements, and so on. And these pop ups are full screen, must be dismissed by a tiny little x, just like every annoying pop up you have experienced. Users have unanimously complained about these pop ups since I started using Spotify, and they have only continued to grow in number. Im guessing Spotify is paid to promote some albums and features, because otherwise it would be solved with an opt-out.Wanna listen to the new Country BBQ playlist? is not only annoying, its totally tone deaf. Spotify literally has access to music profiles for users and still hawks the same stuff to all their users.If this continues, I think I will be annoyed enough to cancel. Respect your paying users, give controls to disable any and all intrusive pop ups.Update 2021: Still tons of ads and pop-ups even on paid plan. Also seem to be tracking a LOT based on the recent privacy information. Yikes"
Review. I have Spotify premium and I love it I just wish that you could look up songs without data. I also wish that you didnt have to download the songs if you want to play them offline. I think that since you pay for premium you shouldnt have to download the songs
OFFLINE?. Ive used spotify for many many years now however even if we were premium or didnt have the data on for the app we were still able to listen to our liked songs. I turned my data off today an no music? No liked album or any of my playlists all because i didnt have the data on and yes im behind a bill payment but seriously???? Taking away my songs... low ball rating for sure
Add 2FA support and fix privacy policy. Add 2FA support and fix privacy policy
"Spotify rating. I am able to use this app on data and not just WiFi and that factor is nice. When I am on runs I can play my playlists that get added songs from  that computerized systems. These systems pick through a data process. It is very secure and that is nice. I have access to so many songs that I like from movies, shows, and just songs by Jonas brothers. Thank You Spotify for making listening to music much better"
"For Spotify: users are dumb. Great feature on Spotify: block abusive (Chris Brown, Marlyn Manson, etc) or trash artists (Nickelback), to make Spotify less triggering. I used to be able to view my blocked artists on the Spotify app. I would share with my friends each year this list of canceled artists for fun, But Spotify has removed all of this functionality. Today, there wonderful solution is performing a data tracking privacy ad request (that Spotify shouldnt be keeping anyway, especially for paying members). Terrible. Also the podcasts Spotify: shut the heck up, nobody (read: nobody) wants your terrible podcasts. People use Spotify because despite of its awful UI, the music features are still pretty good. Further, everyday that Joe Rogan still uses you as a benefactor is another day I question where my $9.99 is going, because it appears that its not the music artists"
Very sneaky. They harvest your data and hide these settings on the website. Meaning if you only use the mobile app to set up and play music youll never see the full privacy settings unless you log in to your account via a browser. Data harvests yet still charges you £9.99 per month. Greedy and dishonest
"Its an amazing app but. Dont get me wrong, i love spotify and listen to it daily but spotify hasn&#39;t been respecting privacy and is making me listen to song that i don&#39;t like such as: watermelon sugar or other song that it knows i wont like but it still does that and i hate it so please FIX THIS"
"Why are you contributing to the gambling epidemic ?. I for maybe 2 weeks on this app found it was of excellent quality, no commercials, could play the music Id like. And then everything suddenly changed. It went from being how I coped with a very difficult series of events in my life, to being constantly forced to listen to advertisements for online gambling. If I was a gambler in recovery this would be exceptionally likely to cause me to relapse. I cannot believe that Spotify is using the same tactics as Phillip C Morris (big tobacco). I only wrote this because Spotify coerced me into reviewing their services. Also to anyone who uses this app, be aware that they are data mining you every time you connect to any device and selling that data to other big names like google, Apple, Honda, and others. This is how they offer free services"
"Unnecessary cellular data usage??. OK so ive had a problem with my albums list not loading if in the elevator for example without signal - which was annoying since Ive had all my albums saved offline and even if I didnt it should be so that it at least shows the offline downloaded albums in the cache for faster loading but Ive stayed quiet about that until now... because this cellular data usage has irked me even more now in situations where Id be in a car and would not even be able to play a downloaded song (??) until i turned my data off/went into airplane mode. Why is Spotify using my cellular data to load a song I specifically downloaded (in very high quality) to not have to deal with loading times? Plus whos paying for this cellular data I never requested to use? (hint: its me). To tie it all up nicely today while listening to a podcast (downloaded may I add) on the road, Id get an annoying clicking sound every few seconds at random intervals. I checked my cellular signal status and there it was - 1 bar of 4G. Turned off cellular data in control center and voila - the annoying clicking ceased. So please tell me, Spotify, what is the point of downloading songs/podcast episodes if my cellular data is going to be used anyways to play them, or worse, interrupt my listening experience with crackling sounds or even making me unable to play a song in general, until I disconnect my phone from cellular signal? Might just have to turn off data usage for Spotify specifically because I dont feel like dealing with this while driving and requiring the data for GPS usage or whatever. Fix ASAP please"

Extremely dissatisfied. I chatted virtually with spotify support months ago about how Id like to remove two followers that are stalkers from my account. Spotify doesnt have a block feature or a way to remove followers. No women wants creepy men that have wronged you in person to be able to know what songs your listening to and your playlists. My music is a safe space from the world for me. I always loved spotify but I was told I could either create a whole new profile which isnt fair since my privacy is whats being invaded. Which I said its pretty ridiculous not to have a block or removing feature. Then they silenced me by saying a higher support team was going to email me back in a few weeks about how to help and they never did. I shouldnt have to hide my profile/ playlists or start a new profile in this situation. I think they have no respect for women being in this situation
"Privacy is awful. Love the app, its great with options and choices. I use it everyday non stop but the privacy and account safety needs a lot of improvement. My account has been hacked multiple times and Ive done all the precautions to prevent this but it doesn&#39;t seem to help all too much"
"Needs a blocking feature. This app is missing a crucical safety/ privacy feature: removing/ blocking followers.  I have a stalker that is following my account and I have no access to block them from my account. I reached out to customer support and the best they could do was to create a new account and theyd transfer over my info to the new account. Why do I have to move and go through all that hassle when it would be way easier to CREATE A REMOVE/ BLOCK FOLLOWER feature. There have been several forums over the past years from Spotify users that have complained and wanted this feature to be implemented due to stalker exes, people who have harassed them. Facebook, Instagram have caught up with this safety/privacy feature. Its time for Spotify to do the same"
"great but improvements needed. i have been using spotify premium for a while now and it&#39;s my favourite platform for listening to music, but i think it&#39;s time for some improvements to be made to the mobile app like being able to change your profile photo without having to log into spotify via a desktop as some may not have access to a laptop or pc. i also think it&#39;s time for an option to change your display name when you&#39;re connected to a facebook account. for privacy reasons i do not want my full name displayed on my profile and on the spotify website it seems as though the only solution i have is to cancel my subscription and completely start over again with a new account... i have over 700 songs saved and don&#39;t have the time to start my entire account over again. as a very popular streaming company, i would think it&#39;s not too difficult to give users the option to change their display name or even the option to hide their surname from others"
"Update?. Love the app - down the road was planning to go premium - then recent upgrade.Dont mind the nicely way of watching ads for the pleasure of use, developers gotta eat too.Had rated app at a 5 star - first review.Data mining - dont like it on google or any mining but understand gotta eat and they corporate so eat well some do.As far as Spotify sure they do re:musical taste, clicking of ad they show Upgrade how ask for app to have access to network?? - why its been working through iPhone for connection to network before why now does it want Bluetooth and network access via app itself?Nope data mining for musical taste is one thing, finding out what dog food I buy or inquired about - not Spotify business imo"
Started off great. Ive had Spotify for about four years and it was all fine up until recently. Everyday I get an email saying my account was signed into and not by me. Not even being dramatic EVERYDAY and no matter how many times I change my password and report the issue nothing gets done to change this. The funny thing is I dont even have premium so these hackers are just getting a free account but what about those who do have premium. Are they having their private card info being seen by these hackers its unacceptable. Dont get the app
"Love it but in needs work. I love the app but I have some suggestions.. so um I think that there are to many adds and its annoying. Also Spotify premium is very expensive. Im not going to pay 10 bucks a month for music. Also it doesnt have certain music. Another thing, I think that we should have the ability to change our usernames and playlist names. Lastly, I think that we should be able to make our playlist private and not share them with the world to listen to. I have some playlists that I dont want other people listing to because the name is personal and its just not things I want just anyone in the world listing to. Please make some changes to your app.                                             -Eli Mak"
"I must be missing something. Ive been using Spotify premium since it prelaunched in the States, and am overall happy with it. It does need some tweaking though.5.9.20Release radar- why is it bringing up tracks Ive already played in the past? Thats not new  I wish there was a way to control what type of music makes that list. For example, I have a playlist for when I go cycling, which has some dance tracks mixed in with my usual genres. Other than that, I never listen to dance music, and I only listen to said playlist seasonally. Half my release radar throughout the entire year is dance/ edm music, and I cant stand it. Also, where did the dont like this track/ artist feature go?? It would be great if the algorithm was able to pull from the types of playlists I listen to on a regular basis, as well as what I play through Sonos. I feel like that info doesnt push through to Spotify at all.I used to be able to reorder my lists of  playlists through the app, and that is now missing as well (not sure when it was pulled). Please bring that backPrevious:Would be awesome if in &#34;your music,&#34; there was an option to see which music you have offline (I&#39;m thinking space/ updating here).Also, would love to be able to see the date songs were added to a playlist.Update 5.1.15. It seems that the multitasking feature was fixed, but now with this latest update, we are back to having to leave the app actively open for it to play. I had it open, then went to write the review...and it killed the music. Latest update on the iPad now requires the app to be actively &#34;on,&#34; meaning, you can&#39;t have it running in the background while, say, checking your email. Once the screen goes to sleep, the song stops playing. Wake your iPad up with Spotify as your screen display, and you&#39;re back running...until it goes to sleep again. Pain in the butt, since I don&#39;t want to set my display to always on, and really have more aid a life than to keep touching the screen every 2 min to keep it going. *this is the case when trying to AirPlay. Not sure about straight up playing, but it didn&#39;t do this before the last update.Things that would be awesome:Ability to edit playlists from the mobile app, where you can reorder songs.Ability to edit playlists you follow, to where you can hide that one song you hate, so it never plays it for that particular user (still exists on master playlist).Ability to group/hide playlists you follow, so it&#39;s not a never ending side panel"
"Could have been perfect. Not denying Spotify is overall more convenient than other apps in terms of its library and consistent quality. It could have been perfect had devs not insisted on restricting customization and controlling features. Not having much control over my privacy settings, having no way of removing listening history, no easy way to rearrange a playlists and libraries etc. has sent me seeking out alternatives. Id happily stick with spotify if it stopped dictating how users experience their own music"
"Covid misinformed. Spotify refuses to take action against covid-19 information, and long with a plethora of other false information on their platform"
"Poor quality and racist and doesnt improve. Having to delete the app as its started to not not play downloaded track offline. Have to download track one doesnt want when they are part of an album or playlist The company should stop wasting our monies on the trailer trash ex royals and invest the same Amount of monies on improving this app which prior to three years ago was very good. You can tell they are getting greedy by expanding what they offer but not expanding good customer service to excellent customer service Also this app is full of Nazi and racist playlists and other unacceptable detritus, Spotify should be removing these and prevent them from being createdAnd some idiot decided to change the layout of this app and it wasnt necessary and it shot wanted , stop messing about you idiots and leave things alone"
"Downloads. Explain to me why I pay for Spotify to have downloads, lists and offline listening. Yet as soon as my phone has minimal to no service or no data it wont load, and also when I click it to offline so I dont use data I also cant listen to anything cause nothing loads. What a waste of money, never had this problem with Apple Music when I was using them. What a scam"
Not good enough. Spotifys latest update looks like another abusive company updating their software largely so they can get more personal data to exploit.  Not good enough.  What is wrong with these people?  How about some integrity?
"Good but some illogical qualms. My issue is that it Spotify eats data if not connected to WiFi - especially podcasts (even if theyre downloaded). If I turn off the mobile data then Spotify removes my downloaded playlists (even when not connected to WiFi) so I cant listen to the daily playlists offline unless Ive already downloaded them the same day. Illogical use of downloads. Apart from these issues, a great user experience"
"It beats most music apps. Spotify takes me back to the TIME of MySpace.com, when users were able to add a playlist to their profile and enjoy it while chatting with friends and other users. The thing that it is missing is the ability to alter your profile page by adding background artwork and such. There are a few songs that I couldnt find. If I were able to customize my profile from zero, I would give it a five star rating. I dont like suggestions being given to me unless I ask for them and that is a problem with most of the apps and social media networks. Sometimes, you just dont want to be easily found by others on the web and that is why you have to be unique with your username, to be given exclusively to those that you want to. There should be more privacy given to social media users if they prefer to have it. I like the idea of building something, (even a social media profile ) from the bottom up, so that In the end (Linkin Park) I can say that I started from the bottom, now Im here ( Drake). Listening to our favorite songs (Ed Sheehan)"
"STOP UNDOWNLOADING MY MUSIC. I pay for Spotify premium yet I still return to albums ive downloaded for them to not be downloaded A scam ,  then I have to use all my data or just go without listening. And its not just like a few albums its at least 20 not downloaded but just liked, I hate it"
Just deleted app. Disapprove of their use of personal information
Bad Security not safe app. My Daughters account was hacked several times.. so she changed passwords MULTIPLE times Contacted Spotify several times transferred her music to a new account only for that to be hacked too She had no issues with any other apps Spotify is not good with their Security&amp; privacy of accounts. No Cust svc support telephone # to call only chat terrible
"Its listening without permission. I was recently listening to music and briefly spoke in a different language. Not something I do routinely and it immediately (within 10 seconds) gave an add in that same language. Per Spotify privacy review it does appear they are listening but says you can opt out by changing microphone access. However, in the privacy setting in the iPhone, there is nowhere Spotify is requesting access. So somehow, Spotify has access to the microphone and there is no way to turn it off"
Location. All my ads are related to my state and that is violating my privacy
I dont like spotify. data hog  It doesn&#39;t function with downloaded songs properly when offline. Not satisfied
"Its up all my cellular data. Playing a podcast when in a car and the video not even showing it is still downloading video, this app is dumb  You need to make it smart so it knows if not watching video it should switch to audio only this is ridiculous  a company the size of Spotify you have such a crappy app"
"Great service (with Linux support) only lessened by privacy violations. Spotify is a better product than Apple Music. Its music recommendations are very good, the interface is superior, as are the personalized mixes, and it supports Linux with a native application. Both Spotify and Apple Music have a web player.However, Spotify has a history of privacy invasion and overreach. That unfortunately muddies the decision between Spotify and Apple Music"
Spotify WORST APP EVER. DONT EVER DOWLOAD SPOTIFY THE WORST APP EVER Spotify is exactly what is wrong with the internet. Data hungry selling people. If you want your data stolen and used please go ahead and download this app
"Spotify: Good or Bad?. I am a frequent use of Spotify. I love that there is unlimited songs and accounts. I have been using this app for almost the entire time I have owned my phone. The only thing I need is access to the app when I dont have WiFi. A few days ago I went on a trip to the mountains (of course I didnt have service), and couldnt access what I didnt download already. The download music feature is highly useful. Why? Lets say you turn your phone on airplane mode every night but want to sleep to music. You can download the playlist/music so when you dont have WiFi or youre on airplane mode, and that is something that I LOVE. Thank you Spotify, for the good times now, and for good times to come"
"Horribly Misleading. You might think that downloading songs onto your Spotify app would prevent the app from then re-downloading each song every time you hit the play button, but youd be wrong  In the last month, Ive only been listening to songs Ive downloaded and Ive used over 10 gigabytes of data.  The overage charge from my carrier is $75.  This is app now costs more than every other app Ive ever paid for combined"
"Poor audio quality. Spotify has the worst audio quality of every major music streaming app.  Its app interface is clumsy and crashes oftenIts a data hogInvasive tracking and access of your phones other data. I just want to listen to some music, why does Spotify need to read my texts, call log and copy my contacts?  Why does it look at my pictures ?"
"Best app In the world - its that simple. Once you get Spotify, you simply wont be able to live without it. It knows my music taste better than me and data insights are incredible"
Collects too much data. If you pay money for a service you should t also have your info sold to third party advertisers and Facebook
Needs some new stuff. A like this app a lot because its free and its super easy to get a account but you should definitely add some features like why do you need premium to download songs? my family travels a lot and when we are going on a road trip I would like to listen to music without using up data. And you should be able to search other users accounts and friend them and your friends could send you songs our a playlist they made. Overall Spotify is a great app dont get me wrong
Data leak again. Jeez Can these people be trusted with our data ever Clearly not
NOT SUPPORTED ON A VPN. Spotify wont even let you pay them for premium music if they cant also rake you over the coals and steal all of youre meta data too
"You cant do anything without Spotify premium. Here I go complaining again, but how can I not? First its so dumb how I HAVE to listen to suggested tracks when I listen to my playlists, and I hate most of them, Ive only liked one suggested track out of the millions that have been suggested through the years that Ive been using Spotify, dont get me wrong I love what theyre doing, letting people listen to their music uninterrupted, but when it says Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free music it means have the next 5-10 minutes of ad-free music, this app was fine back in late 2018 to early 2019, but theyve just ruined it by taking away most privileges given to free track users and given them to premium users, its stupid, once they make it back to what it was in 2018-2019 maybe Ill come back, but till then Im not using this app. Sorry for the rant its just this app has disappointed me so much"
"Former Premium User. I thought this might be the best alternative to YouTube Music (Google/Alphabet owns that and I dont like their privacy practices) but given Spotifys indifference to COVID-19 misinformation on their platform, I see no reason to continue using it.  Allowing that to proliferate harms EVERYONE.  In all honesty I found it less intuitive to use and that it offered less appealing music selections than YouTube Music as well"
"Info button. I love Spotify It has a very streamline design that conveys necessary information well. I would like a button that allows you to view a lot of information that the average user doesn&#39;t need or want to see. By that, I mean some of the information you use to determine what playlists to make for me; how many times I&#39;ve listened to a song, album, playlist, or artist; songs added or deleted from a playlist; deleted playlists; etc. Please and thank you,-Me"
"Non-existent security. Spotifys security is terrible. My account was hacked, and yes I use a password manager, and the hacker changed my account email without any problems at all. Not only that, Spotify doesnt mask any of your personal information attached to your account. Not only that, you cant remove your payment methods so if you get hacked the hacker can sign you up for a plan and you wouldnt even know"
"App is great, poor customer service. My account was hacked and I am no longer able to access it. When I tried to contact them I found out you can only do so by logging into your Spotify. If its hacked, youre screwed. I have premium so Im having to go through my bank to cancel my subscription since Spotify cant help"
Spotify premium is so bad. I recently bought Spotify premium and when ever I dont have my data on it doesnt work. Yet it says I can listen to music offline. Also whenever I do use my data the song stops every 5-10 seconds. If your looking for a music app just buy Apple Music
"Tracking, steals data and very bad update. 1- it tracks you.2- it steals your data.3- why extra songs and random songs inside my playlist?"
"Something changed. I love Spotify, have used premium for years, never had any issues really to speak of. Until recently now it just chews up all my data, like an absurd amount. I even have all the podcasts I listen to downloaded but listened to maybe 5 songs on the way home and it used 2.7gb of data? How is that possible?"
"Good content. App needs work. If Spotify could get its apps to work they would be the Netflix of audio but the apps dont work and have never worked well. Finally after years it seems like the local cache issue has been fixed. That only took like 8 years but thank you  not having my entire phone memory taken up by Spotify cache with no way to purge, really has made my phone usable again. With the resources you have available, please make the app work consistently. Your content is great. No doubt. Here are the problems that I have consistently, in order:#1 - I use Spotify more in the car than anywhere else. So this is important to me the app never (literally, never) works right in the car with CarPlay. The track appears, shows the pause button (so assume that means its playing) but it does nothing. I can try other tracks, podcasts, playlists, etc and nothing will play. I have to force close the app on my phone and start over an sometimes it will work. Other times I drive about 10-15 minutes before I give up and open Audible which immediately plays  also that happens literally every time. If Spotify wont play, I open Audible and it works. Also my car has Spotify as a native app. That works when the iOS version doesnt, but I have to leave CarPlay to use it which defeats the purpose. My point with the comparisons is that if the other apps work I expect Spotify to work. So my #1 request is to please integrate with CarPlay better, so it just works, every time I get in the car. Like it should. #2 - The app design makes navigating through playlists, albums, and podcasts difficult; and from desktop to phone to car to AppleTV the consistency is just not there. The desktop seems to be the best experience, for obvious reasons, but the iOS version needs help. I use the app a decent amount and I still cant figure out whats happening when the app loads, on the initial view (the home-screen? Not sure what to call it). There are all these recommendations but I dont want recommendations, I want either A) - my saved content, or B) - to search. The recommendations are nice but they should be secondary and instead make the Home Screen feel disorganized and inconsistent. Basically I cant find anything when the app loads. I have to search around for my playlists. But then where are my podcasts?? I still dont know. I have to search and then I can find them. Im sure more advanced users dont have this problem but were not all advanced users. #3 - Device switching is non existent. Im listening on my laptop and pause it, then pickup my phone; #1- I get an error along the lines of this content is restricted on this device, and #2 - I have to find the podcast or track I was listening to. Theres no handoff. Something a little more graceful than that should have been done but its been like that for a few years.Instead theres an option to control from another device? But it doesnt work. And why would I want to control from another device? Why not just open the app on the other device and seamlessly continue listening? It seems like those are both possible use cases but a seamless handoff should be the priority and control seems like a secondary solution to limited use cases. This has been around for a long time so Im assuming its a legacy feature that cant be let go for some reason - because it just makes no sense. To summarize, you have great content, the cost is reasonable, the app shouldnt be difficult, a media player, just make it simple and work. Copy iTunes from years ago. Whatever just take out the unnecessary bloat and make it work. Please. Thanks for reading"
"Ads are lying. We are all familiar with the infamous Spotify ads that attempt to make us go premium so that we can play music anywhereWell, Im here to tell you I have premium, and have downloaded ALL my playlists...still cant play a single f***ing song... what the heck? Im in my CAR Why does this app have so many issues?? I really wish that I could play my music while writing this review, but even with my data on, the good for nothing app STILL continues to fail at the ONE THING they said they could do...what did I expect though from this crap app"
"Spotify Honest Review. I have a free account on Spotify. And I just wanna say that this music streaming app is one of the best Ive ever used. Spotify is world-famous for this. As a free account Im sure a lot of complaints have been spread around. One, because theres too many ads. Two, because of skips. Those complaints are because youre not willing to pay for premium. Honestly, I think that on a free account, all these things can just disappear. Spotify needs to earn money either way. Spotifys problem is that when free accounts play an album, the album comes with suggest tracks. These suggested tracks have nothing to do with the album. I was listening to Go Live which is Stray Kids album and Dreamcatchers Deja Vu came on.Not only in Dreamcatcher a girl group, Stray Kids and Dreamcatcher are very different. Please collect data correctly and make suggested tracks at least by the artist of the tracks we were originally listening to"
"Music on the go, no data plan required. This app is so awesome for the amazing selection of music available for download such that wifi or data plan are not required on the go. Great for running I love this app"
Great app with terrible privacy. Title says it all. The app tracks every little detail about you. What a terrible way to ingest music and media. What could this be for? Oh perhaps to follow you all over the internet
"Spotify review. This app is the best, the app does not use your data which is a big deal on my part I love it, no adds fast service best music app worth the $ for premium why pay for phub premium when you can get Spotify premium"
"Explicit content and no clean versions and other things this app needs to make it better. When I found out tate McRae, Meghan Trainor, dua lipa, the chainsmokers, fifth harmony, maroon 5, five seconds of summer and Lennon Stella and other rap, edm, and pop bands and artists have bad language in there music it made me disappointed because I expected better for this app. and you can only find the clean versions on YouTube. Other than that I love the app it is just this final adjustement. Because if some ones favorite song has bad language and uses bad words and YouTube has it and Spotify does not then it looks bad for the app. This is one of my favorite apps besides YouTube, I heart, Pandora and prime music I would give all of these apps 5 stars each. I think this app is amazing and has lots of songs but I think that it can be better I would give this app one  star out of five stars but if you fix this issue I Would give this app 5 out of 5 stars. Plus I dont like when toh switch from play list to play list it gives you commercials the same thing happens after each song even though it says after a half an hour it will give you an add they lie and give you one every 3 to 5 mins depending on how long the sign is that your Listening to. And it takes up most of the storage o your phone no matter what kind of a phone you have. I also dont. Like that they have things on this app that track you and invade your privacy. I also dislike that this app does not let you recover deleted playlists but on the computer version it does. What and why? I also think that they should add Disney plus, or ESPN, or peramont plus, or Amazon prime video, or fandango to the student Spotify plan"
"Used to be better. For the past two years, Ive been using Spotify premium. Excellent service, and great music. However (for personal reasons) I am now unable to use Premium, and have switched back to free mode. A lot has changed. Now, I am unable to freely choose the music I want, loop a playlist, edit said playlist. I dont care about the ads. I just want to have more freedom with my music. Please consider loosening restrictions on free users"
Spotify crashing my phone. Recently out of nowhere Im music would stop I didnt really care until it started to crash my phone and its cellular data I had to reset my settings every 10 sec into a song because this app would crash my phone
"Skim personal info for no reason. To register they forced me to state my gender and my age, why?"
"Stop. They keep ruining the app with updates, you should be able to view artists and songs youve downloaded without data but apparently not"
Sucks that Im constantly having to redownload things Ive already downloaded. I drive truck for a living so enjoy Spotify and the commercial free music and podcasts wherever I go and not use data but find it very annoying that I am constantly having to redownload what I have already downloaded in order to listen to them if I have had time to get to them. I am starting to lean more towards audible and my other music app as I only have to download it once on those
"Deletes downloads. I only gave two stars because I think I can get the same experience from other services without a big headache. Every once in a while Spotify removed many of the albums I have downloaded. They dont remove them from the service, they just are no longer downloaded on my phone. This is important because I work mostly alone and away from WiFi, so I download music to not use data. I have tried all the work arounds they post on the customer service pages. I even got a brand new phone and it keeps happening. I think Ill be switching soon"
"Revolting interface and unfair pay for artists. The interface is just atrocious. The fact that you cannot choose to automatically start at my library is bad enough. Instead, every time you open the app, you start out on a recommendations page that has a bunch artists you dont want, just randomly, chaotically arranged. Then you have to navigate to your library, then choose artists, and once you click the artist you want to listen to, you are brought to a page of random chaos that is not even the discography of the artist. You have to scroll down a bunch of random recommendation fluff, before you reach the bottom where it says see discography, which is where you really want to go when youre playing music from an artist. So you can choose the album or song. I thought the iOS music app was bad, this is even worse.Once you choose an album, there are also no track numbers or lengths, this is reprehensible design. Weve gone backwards, screens are getting bigger but all the info is being stripped away. Why?We need at least optional settings to fix all this. Users should have more control over their music library setup.The music selection is incredible, but obviously that isnt Spotifys doing, thats more on the artists end. And the pricing is good for the user.Last problem, and the most immoral, is that the artists make almost nothing from Spotify unless they are already successful and well known (in which case they dont need it). Spotify can afford to pay artists more, they just dont. So support your artist on their bandcamp if you really like their music"

"THE BEST STREAMING APP  EVER . You can listen to so much songs They respect privacy so much Listen to all your favorite songs And all that music is free Get Spotify now, and you will have the time of your life"
"Great App. I have been using Spotify since they first came into the states back in 2011 and have never looked back. Theyve made changes and updates to the software that have significantly improved how easy it is to navigate. Anything they do change that Im not a fan of usually isnt detrimental to the apps performance itself, so I dont really complain. But for some reason, this new update has hindered my ability to view my queue when I listen to music. This is really not that pleasant cause I use last.fm to toggle these queued songs to turn into playlist if I really liked the flow of the tracks I put together"
"Very poor customer service. Representatives are clueless and simple. They will not let you just pay through the Spotify account, and this caused me to pay to the wrong account. We tried to contact them to remedy the problem an there is no contact number. We contact text support and they send us emails wanting information to we can not reply to. We send information and proof of purchase numerous times. Each time a different representative ask for the same information with no way to reply. They send request for us to email information from emails that do not accept replies. We contacted them about this problem weeks ago, and after sending all the info they wanted (several times) it still is not corrected. They had no problem taking money out of our account in minutes but will not provide us with the service requested nor return our money weeks later"
"My personal opinion on Spotify. Spotify is a musical service that gives you access to millions of songs, and its access is simple and easy to learn. When new updates are made, the change is easy to adapt to and benefits the user. I use it 24/7, and its connected to other systems which lets me use Spotify in networks and hear to my Playlists. I recommend Spotify to anyone, because it makes my day better"
"Itll never be the same as physical format. until it does two very simple things.1. Publish sleeve (liner in the US) notes for the albums.2. Give the line-ups. Not knowing who was playing in the band, and on which track, is frustrating. Its information that would always be on a decent labels LP, CD, cassette etc. Sometimes, in a small group, you can just about make it out if it happens to have been printed on the cover and if the picture happens to make it visible. Otherwise its a visit to Discogs, the leaders website or a reference book. If the information was noted in the original recordings package, why not reprint it on Spotify. Its factual information that surely cannot involve any copyright issues"

Spotify. Spotify is great but it would be better if it didnt need internet or data
Data Conscious Premium User Unable to Listen on CarPlay. I have music downloaded to my phone and up until recently the app only could play playlists on CarPlay. Recently even that ability has stopped functioning. I&#39;ve had to ditch Spotify all together while driving which has been a travesty since I&#39;m paying for premium. Could you please fix the app&#39;s CarPlay integration to allow users to listen to any downloaded music when streaming is turned off? Thanks
Need Apple TV and Apple Watch app. Im trying to use my phone as little as I can. I leave it say home on my walks. I do have the cellular Apple Watch. Apple Music works fine without the phone. As a developer I do know that Apple opened up the streaming API for the watch. Whats the hold up Spotify? Trying to build a case against Apple even if that means hurting your customers?
"Frustrated. Multiple times this month Spotify has unsaved all of my music off of my phone hard drive overnight. This is incredibly annoying if you save 3000+ songs to your phone. It takes hours to resolve, and will be the reason I switch to Apple Music if this continues.Update: reduced to a 1 star review. Spotify REQUIRES data to play your tracks that are saved to the hard drive of the phone. Even if you have the songs downloaded you will still need data for Spotify to remember which albums you have saved. Such a failure Bye bye Spotify"
"Blocks VPN in use, and practically no option to opt out of tracking. As a paying customer, theyre able to monitor and utilize account data to the extreme extent laid out in their terms.  It thats not enough, apparently. They are now blocking use  of the app when operating through VPN.  Honestly, screw you"
Great but disappointing. I love Spotify It used to plug and play into my car audio player with all information on screen..... now with the new update it has stopped working and say no data available and plays audio only. I used to be able to change tracks from the head unit and everything but now it wont work 
"Wonderful, But Needs Edits. Great platform, super to explore music. But Spotify really needs to get rid of the incredibly repetitive Turn Off Airplane Mode or Use Wi-Fi to Access Data messages when Im listening offline. The ability to download and listen later is amazing, but seeing the same message every time I turn my screen back on is driving me bonkers. I know when Im connected and when Im not. I absolutely dont need the app reminding me"
"Downloaded songs often un download. While I like Spotify in general, I have premium and can download my playlists to play offline. Very, very often I want to play the songs when I dont have data and somehow theyve just undownloaded themselves. I dont listen to my music on my phone often, maybe once or twice, but almost every time I do, this happens. Its really annoying when youre on a plane"
"Overall bad user experience. Only use this to listen to JRE. Really clunky, heaps of playback issues and app time bar almost always stalls in a single spot and play pause will resume from the paused stalled spot. Spotify seem to care more about sharing your data even when you pay for it. And they seem to think that sharing what your listening to with your friends is something we all want?BUY APPLE MUSIC, 100% better in every aspect"
"Well. It is just amazing one of my most used apps One thing though (I know not an easy fix) I listen to a lot of music and need it downloaded for (train, car, plane etc) and I didnt realise how much storage it takes My phone ran out of storage and Spotify was taking most storage, 15GB I do understand this is because it is a lot of data to download, I was thinking you could have the option to download to a Spotify cloud only for premium maybe, and you could download to phone from there? Hope I am not being difficult, many wishes for the future, app deserves this so so much and its prices are next level The family option is crazy value, recommend for these times when your getting work done ;)"
. Good but why do you need so much personal data?
"Great app, just one thing. So I have been using Spotify for around 4 years now, and honestly, I love it. It is a great app and I love how you can get customized playlists just for you, and you can listen to podcast as well as music. There is just one thing I dislike about the app. Spotify premium. AND NO I am not another person saying that premium should be free or anything like that. I get it, you guys need money because you a business, but I do think that Spotify premium should be different. Its hard to listen to the music you like because once you playlist ends, it plays suggested track, which I find very inaccurate, and then for the next, like, 2 days, I go to play the playlist and it still just plays the suggested track. But anyway, there is one more thing im gonna say, and its that there is a glitch that is really annoying. Sometimes, Ill hit skip and if I have used all my skips, it will show the pop up that says  you have discovered a premium feature And when I close the pop up, it will pop up again less than a second later. It will continue to do this, which means I cant do anything so I have to close the app. Other than that, you guys are great. Keep it up. ( youre probably not gonna read this anyway but whatever) "
"Issue with an account? Just make a new one . Recently I ran into an issue where spotify (both on app and on website) will not let me change playlist names or pictures. Small issue, right? I try doing a clean reset on both phone and desktop and it doesnt work. I email support and after demonstrating that it was not my phone and proving that it happens, was told to make a new account. I have spotify premium, and this would not carry over to the new account, had I made one, and neither would the listening history (had this account since at least 2015) and would need to use a different email unless I provided my personal information, in which case I could use the same email. When I reached out about other options in 3 separate emails, I was ignored. Ridiculous that a multi-billion dollar company cannot fix a rather small issue and yet can implement something like spotify wrapped "
"Ava L. Spotify is a great app, you can listen to music even when you arent on the app My only issue is the fact that when I have no data I have no music I love making music, although. Im not popular music is a passion of mine and without internet/Wifi I cant listen to it. Even though I cant always listen to music I can listen to tons when I can altogether 4 star"
"Support. I loved the app when I had all of my music, but I dont love it as much anymore. Recently I believe my account was hacked, I went to the app one day I was logged out and I wouldnt let me reset my password. It was very frustrating because they said I would get details on how to reset my password but I never got the emails. So I then looked up Spotify Support to see if there was anyone I could talk to, and turns out there really isnt unless you want to tag them on Twitter. This was also frustrating because I needed help and someone to explain to me what to do, but there was no number to call or email address to email. At this point I think I may have to remove my account and restart. This is very frustrating because it means that I have lost multiple playlists with hundreds of songs. Please improve support and security in the future"
Spotify premium. Love this app love the price love being able to listen offline and not use data keep it up guys love personalized playlists shared playlists being able to listen to music in groups this is literally the best streaming app for music cant stress it enough they constantly improve it best investment I ever made
I think everyone should get premium. If your trying to get everyone to use your app I may like it but we shouldnt have to pay premium we should just get and pick out music freely as some people cant afford to pay but want to listen to music and you should be able to download so you dont have to use your data 
"Hacked twice in a month. My account has been hacked twice in a month and Ive followed the steps Spotify provides, but something needs to be done about it soon. Im sick of paying for a service I cant even use. It appears, like many other services, Spotify is sharing our data including payment and subscription data. There is no way to stop this, you can only request to download it. Which may take 30 days"
"Erase recently played history. They removed the option to delete your recently played history.I let a friend borrow my phone for an hour.  They hopped on Spotify to listen to music, and now their tracks are part of my history.  I used to be able to delete that history, but Spotify removed that option.  Now my friends songs keep popping up and I dont listen to that musicBasic feature removed for no apparent reason"
Hard to Access. It used to never be like this but they keep taking away any spotify free users controls like I had premium because I got a couple of months free for it so I had it for a bit and it was so easy to do things but then I went back to free because Im broke and its like so hard to even make a playlist you cant just look at the track list you have to shuffle through songs on that album and sometimes not even on the album like its just so terrible how is anyone who obviously cant afford premium able to use this like there is no reason it should be this hard I dont have a problem with not being able to play on demand but I atleast want to be able to view track list like normal
Used to be good. Ive had Spotify for years now and I pay for the premium so I can listen to music when Im in my car or down at my shop without using my data up but here lately the app keeps un downloading all of my songs and so then I have nothing to listen to
"Great, but update problems. I really enjoy using Spotify. Ive been a premium user for years. Every once and a while theres a bug with an update, but gets resolved fairly quickly. However, lately, it seems every other update makes it so you cant listen to music that youve downloaded. The past few days I havent been able to rely on my downloaded music. I dont use cellular data with this app. If this can be resolved quickly, that would be great"
"Pay the artists. Id give Spotify four stars if it added liner notes and personal info, copyright Info and so on, five if it actually paid the artists. Fat chance"
"interaction. I really love spotify I just wish there were more ways to interact with my friends and what theyre listening to so I can expand my music horizons. I know that on the mac I can see what my friends have last listened too, or what theyre listening too, but on chrome or my phone that feature isnt available. I would really like to see my friends top artists, most listened to songs at the moment, what theyre listening to, and Id love to be able to see who likes my playlists. I think the app could be more universal and create more togetherness if there was a more social aspect. Obviously if you dont want people to be able to see that all then you can change that in your privacy settings. Music is something that has been shared ever since music became music. Music creates togetherness. I feel like spotify should reflect that a bit more"
This app. Honestly I hate Spotify due to the reason you cant skip songs. You cant listen to music you want to. Just listen to YouTube instead arent as many adds and you can skip as much as you want. But Ill give Spotify one good thing is that the cellular data is better but I hate Spotify
"Not so great on phone. I have been using Spotify for years until recently, heres why I stopped 1. It shuffles albumsWhy, just why? What if Im listening to an album that is a continuous story, also it plays recommended music from other artists whilst Im listening to an unrelated album . Why do they do that? 2. It adds songs to your playlist ( if the list has less than 15 tracks)Why do they feel the need to do this? If Im satisfied with a small playlist, then just let me have a small playlist3. Ads ads adsAds are fine to me, but these ads are head ach inducing"
"Used to be great. This app used to have an amazing feature for runners that would analyze running tempo and play music at that BPM. It was awesome. Not satisfied with just being awesome, Spotify made some simply mind blowing original running tracks. Indescribably beautiful. Then they decided to kill the feature off with no warning. Then they told customers that they will look into maybe bringing it back if there was interest. Then they decided that despite overwhelming interest that the case is closed and it is not coming back. This used to be a service worth paying for. It used to be an app worth its space on your phone. Used to be"
Compliments and complaints. I love Spotify so much because i can find all my favorite music and it doesnt take up much storage my only complaint would be that u need WiFi and it would be a lot more useful if I didnt have to use my data
"Missing one key feature. After years of Spotify it still doesnt have an option for low data use on mobile network. It only has an option for low data which is very frustrating. I work away from home in the bush for 3-5 days at a time and if I forget to click the low data mode I can go through my 20 gigs very quickly. I just leave it on low data mode, download most of my music and use my tablet at home with high quality enabled. It is also doesnt download an entire playlist. It just decides to download 50% of it. Also frustrating when Im in the bush in certain areas with no network"
Why?. Spotify is good but I find it super annoying that the app adds songs to my personal playlist that I didnt put there and I dont even like. It does that when you have a playlist of under 15 songs
"Amazing but one issue. Im a teen, {13} and I love Spotify, I use it all the time and I cant pay for premium so I cant listen to a certain song or use it without WiFi, if I do Ill use up all my data and get in trouble... so maybe dont make those things premium, yea yea yea I get it makes you money but dont you want more downloads and happier people? Its just music like come on now"
Why am I paying for premium?. Why is it that my premium Spotify account will not load when the data is turned off for the app? All of the songs I have liked are not loading at all and they are all downloaded already. What is going on? Why am I paying $10 a month for such horrible reliability?
"Not a fan of premium. After about 8 years of using Spotify free with no problems, as soon as I hopped on my brothers family plan for free premium courtesy of him, Ive had a million issues. My music often wont play on wifi or data, much less off data with my downloaded music. Its so frustrating. I just want to listen to music it shouldnt be this much of a pain"
Acc got hacked :/. Premium 1 year acc got hacked half way through. Spot-on privacy spotify
Spotify Wrapped Feedback. I love this app. Used it since 2012 and wont stop using it anytime soon. Only feedback would be for more data in the Spotify wrapped Id love to know how many times Ive listened to each song on my top played. More data the better
"Transparency. How does such a huge streaming company not have the appropriate resources to offer analytics about their streams? You have access to our data and our money, at least be transparent"
"Gotta love the. -Data saver.-high quality beats.-discord compatibility.-blue tooth device compatibility.-the linking via internet.-downloadable/ offline quality.-THE FREE MONTH AND WIDE VARIETY OF SONGSOww and dont forget the half an hour add free featureGood job too all behind SpotifyEJ - H.Edit:-I forgot, IT IS FREE TO LISTEN WITH SCREEN OFF AND OR NOT IN SPOTIFYDOWNLOAD NOW"
"Spotify is wonderful. When I turned 16 and got my first job, the first thing I bought with the money was Spotify premium. Now Im 21 and spend money on a lot more things and am still convinced the most important line item is Spotify. I love how theyve used data to transparently hyper personalize the experience. While almost every app in existence uses your data, this id one of the few that gives you your datas insights. Spotify Wrapped day has become quite a holiday. The new blend feature is fantastic. The only thing Id want to change is choosing a person AND a mood filter. For example, if Im with my friend about to chill, Id like to just see our songs in common that are chill"
"Why wont this app let me sign up?. I got this app and it asks for my birthday but will not accept it.  Or my email.  Tells me something went wrong, try again.  Guess being born in the 70s is unacceptable for Spotify use.  Oh well.  This app is useless to me as it will not accept any of my information to sign up.  I dont get it???Now I figured it out  They want me to turn off my security server so they can track me.  Big no to Spotify"
"The worst. Absolutely the most user unfriendly app Ive ever used. Theres no way to get any account information from the app to log into another device. Every 10 minutes an ad pops up in a way that they know youll click it trying to pause youre music. Its shady and has been the most frustrating time Ive ever had trying to use an app. If my favorite podcast wasnt exclusive to this trash company Id never use it again. Get it together Spotify, how old is this app? 5 years? 10 years old? Christ, just make it usable"
"Logging in complicated. I deleted Spotify and want it back, I forgot both my password and username, I just want it back, they ask for personal info but logging in never works, Ive tried and tried but it never works, fix it, and whoever owns this the play store, fix it"
Meh. I pay for premium and apparently someone went into my account and instead of taking personal information or actually playing music they cancelled my account which is really sus and Spotify was little to no help all they did was help me regain access but not restart my membership even though I wasnt the one who allowed the cancellation so now I gotta wait until the end of the month to be able to restart my account
"Horrible ui and download issues. I have been using Spotify for a few years now and everything was fine until they changed the ui. My biggest problem was the removal of the pop up ui on pc. One day I was trying to play downloaded music without reception, and nothing would play. I had to remove all my downloads and local data and then reinstall the app, and re download all my music. Also sometimes mid song, it will just randomly skip. And sometimes when you try to play a downloaded song, it will stop playing at ten seconds, and will take several attempts to fully play. You would honestly be better off buying an Apple Music subscription"
"Still not wort it, unpolished app. I used to have Spotfy premium for years until I changed to apple music. Spotfy had so many app issues back then, including deleting all music downloaded out of nowhere while I was travelling, I had no WiFi close or data on my plan so my 2 hour trip back home had no music. After 1 year of apple music I decided to give spotfy a shot again. Turns out the app is even worse. Hint Spotfy: when you user has to google &#34;how to remove a music from the library&#34; because the dedicated app button doesn&#39;t work OR &#34;how to place a music on repeat&#34; because I can&#39;t find it in the player it means you have some really bad design and user interface. You guys change things too often without a proper conditions explanation. Still a unfinished app from a company that insist on dictating how we should be using a music player"
"App refuses to work without cellular data. Spotify charges you their 30% App Store fee. Did you know that Spotify charges you $3 extra to buy the subscription from the apple store instead of directly from Spotify? Apparently they tried to tell the public back in 2015. Youd think they could have sent out an email or something. This on top of the other problems, below is going to push me cancel my subscription and go to use Apple Music. Apple gave me 6 months free anyway. Spotify used to be great. Then it started not playing my downloaded music. I have followed their instructions removing my downloaded content and then completely removing the app and reinstalling multiple times. It works great afterwards for a while. Spotifys new thing is to act like my downloaded music is all up to date until I leave my wifi. Then it requires cellular data to be turned on to play the music I just downloaded. It then often acts like I never downloaded the playlists and it has to use cell to download the new songs.Pay your artists, not Joe Rogan"
"Data leak. Data keeps getting leaked, theres someone else constantly connecting to my account, changed the email, switch passwords logged everything out even tho I only have this on my phone, sort your security out or Ill cancel premium and go to YouTube music over this app"
This is a good app but. I really love Spotify but i would love to. E able to listen to my music without having internet or data. I think that you should be able to download music (like you can with podcasts) so that you can listen to music offline. But over all a really goo app
"Would be five  but they ruined it. I had all my music organized by the year I listened to. Each playlist was named something specific to me at that time so it was essentially music chronology telling my story. Now I go to find music and my personal library has been updated so it shows either recently played(already featured on the Home Screen so its unneeded), recently added, alphabetical, or by the music creator. All of these things were a part of the app already. Not sure why Spotify thought they knew how I would like to organize my music. Because now I cant find a single playlist I made without stopping and reading each title individually"

Problems. UI problems and privacy concerns. Customer service bad at receiving feedback
"Ive A Few Issues. So. The concept of this app is great Ill start with that, because then it goes downhill. The aesthetic, the fact that many lesser-known artists are there as well as more popular ones, I like it But there are some problems that Ive gotten sick and tired of over the last few years Ive been using spotify. First of all, lets talk about ads. Oftentimes I get more ads than I do songs, or at least the same amount, which, in my opinion, is unfair. This is a music app, not an advertisement app, maybe have more than three songs before three to five ads. Then there are the premium ads. Have you thought about getting premium? Yes, I have, but currently I dont have enough money to pay ten dollars a month for it. I dont like that I have to hear ads to make the app better that I cant afford. Next, lets talk about shuffling and suggested tracks.  The suggested tracks on my playlists is fine, sometimes the songs are good and I like to add them to the playlist. But recently I was listening to a musical on shuffle, and the mood is completely ruined by the suggested tracks, which cannot be turned off, and with six skips per hour, I couldnt get out of the pit of suggested songs and get back to my musical.  I have an issue with skips as well but well talk about that later. These kinds of suggested tracks that send you down a rabbit hole of songs that arent related to the album itself.  I suggest to either make the number of suggested tracks smaller, or just not have them in general. Finally, the skips, or lack thereof.  Earlier in this review, I spoke about how I was unable to get out of the rabbit hole of suggested music with only six skips.  I find this a huge and jarring problem, because if youre going to suggest songs that the listener might not want to listen to (which, in my opinion, is more often the case), you may want to add more skips per hour (maybe 10 or 15) because that would make it easier for people to deal with the large amount of unwanted music. Either way, sorry this was so long but I needed to get it out that most of the time, this is a good app, but there are a few big issues that, if tweaked or fixed, would make a lot of people happier"
Forcing tracking. This was my favourite app until they decided to force my to allow tracking Now it is imposible to use :(
Spotify Developers please read this. I just downloaded the app. Its very nice so far I have used it only for a minute but something I realized is that you cant download songs so can you guys please make a way to download songs that we would need when we go somewhere and we dont have wi-if or cellular data. Very nice app by the way
"Our personal touches. I love Spotify I just wish adding our own personal touches like pictures to our playlist was easier instead, like on our phones so we dont always have to use our laptop"
No block feature. Cant make people unfollow you or block them. Not a fan of lack of privacy
Cool idea. So I personally love Spotify. I love the personal mixes it brings - what I would REALLY love is if one of the apps I could connect it with is my iPhones alarms. If there was an area in the app to set wake up alarms and use the music Ive downloaded through the app (or other songs if data or WiFi is available) I would 109% use it every morning
"Tracking. The answers always no , why asking me to allow it with a pop up screen and the only way to get rid of it is to close the app"
The update is trash. You used to be able to select whatever track you want and play it. Now you can only hear a bit of the track and you always have to shuffle. Spotify also adds tracks you dont even know or like into playlists you make. You didnt even like the track but you have to listen to it because it wont let you skip after around 6 skips. This app is trash now
"New annoying music-stopping pop ups. I pay you for music. Not promotional marketing and data harvesting. Now you have pop ups that ask me if I want to be tracked even after Ive said no. The only choice is choose and no exit button, forcing me to hard exit the app, stop my music and re open the app. Leave people alone and do the job we pay you for - to play music"
"Why is using so much data. Latest update now means I use 650mb on my 30 minutes commute to work. Normal quality nothing caching in background. No settings changed, but still using excessive data when it did not do this before. Spotify support were useless and just wanted me to contact my mobile provider to get accurate data logs, which I wasnt prepared to do. As a premium family customer, I expected better. Oh well, there are lots of competition to use instead"
"Spotify broken and costing me money. If it worked perfectly I would rate it 5 stars, but it does not. Every time my iPhone switches off, Spotify loses all my downloaded music. In a country with cheap data, this would not be a problem, but in South Africa data is expensive. Spotify is in essence costing me money every time my phone switches off. They have, after much trying on my part, said it was a cache problem on my account and that they fixed it. Still happening. Lately also signing out my account and saying my details are wrong. Then hour later no problem. Also the hack and time wasted every time as stops downloading when the the iPhone screen locks - surely you can sort this??? Try downloading thousands of tracks, its a mission. So looks like I will be going back to IMusic"
"Need premium. If you have Spotify premium this app is absolutely incredible. Without premium the app is still very good however it does not allow you to download music, skip a lot of songs, or listen add free. If you purchase premium which is a great price you will unlock add free listening along with the ability to download songs and get unlimited skips"
To many advertisements :( it will drain your data. To many advertisements :( it will drain your data and battery before you listen to the music. There are other valid apps
"Good App and Very Much Worth the Subscription. It took me a long to to pay for Spotify and now Im not sure why that was. It gives you an incredible level of access to practically everything ever recorded, and you have complete control over what you listen to. Just get it, for goddsakes"
"You guys are bullying non premium users. You guys need to at least remove the playing suggested tracks feature. My father passed away recently and I set up a playlist of his favorite songs and then this really sad one that made me bawl my eyes out but then the stupid playing suggested tracks thing and it played a song encouraging abusing freedom and responsibility, That they are going to drink and over  using drugs, that they will reject and ignore all the people trying to reach out to them and help them, to have intercourse with as many people as they can, partying all of the time, not caring about anything, and being lazy and using other people to get what they want. I have already used my free trial and cant mourn in peace. I have a job that can barely put food on the table and I have horrible insurance. After my father passed away I couldnt afford to pay all of his bills and things like that. His funeral had me work overtime to pay for it. I could barely pay my bills before the whole incident and I am paying off debt so I cant afford premium. I got an ad about a heavy metal band called funeral and I almost chucked my phone Across the room. Please take out the playing suggested tracks feature because it just drives me away from Spotify and to Pandora. You should add a feature where if you watch a short ad you can play a song of your choice. Please consider my story and change the non-premium BS. (PS: if you think Im fake or whatever because of the name that my reviews are sent under its because I let my nephews play on my phone and they made a funny name and I dont know how to change it) (PPS: This is a story from a friend of mine but Im just telling it in a first person perspective. The first PS is true about me)"
"Just one problem. I use Spotify on a daily basis and its great, unfortunately I dont have premium but I dont mind living without it. Spotify is great and I have numerous playlists which I listen to around the house, or in the shower. Theres one thing that gets on my nerves, and no, not the adverts, its the Playing Suggested Track feature. Ive googled how to turn it off, (go to settings, playback and turn off Autoplay). Ive done that, but I keep on getting Suggested Track. Its extremely annoying, because I just want to listen to my playlist, not random songs that I have never heard before. Spotify is a great app and I do love using it, but the Suggested Track feature is really spoiling it for me"
"If you like music then this is all you need. Best app in the world Great for creating playlists of your own fave music Great for listening to artists own playlists All new albums, singles etc etc Theres everything and everyone on Spotify the moment its out thereGo for premium and then you can download the tracks and listen whilst out and about and not use your data"
Go f yourself. Stop asking to track me or update my email it none of your dam business about my personal information
Manipulation. Spotify try to force users to subscribe by limiting functionality and deliberately playing tracks that you may sometimes skip to further irritate the user in order to force them to subscribe. Further more. Repetitive adverts serve to do the same. Do yourself a favour and subscribe to Apple Music. Much cleaner functionality. 
Rubbish. I wish Spotify would stop messing around with the app and just make it work properly. Ive come on holiday with an iPod full of downloaded albums but none of them will play offline so Im stuck here for two weeks without any music. I have no WiFi nor data connection so cannot easily reinstall the app let alone download 18Gb of music. Should have stuck to ripping CDs...at least that worked
"Im having some problems with Spotify premium. I used to just have the free Spotify and it was fine because I didnt mind the ads but For Christmas I got Spotify premium so I could listen to music when I travel without using all my data. It now doesnt let me use Spotify on my iPod at all and its not letting me download podcasts on my phone. Im not sure why this is happening whether its my devices (its only logged onto my phone and iPod), does anyone know??? As long as you dont have these problems I think that this is a great app"
"Rarely works right, always crashes. I would not recommend Spotify to anyone.  90% of the time it just crashes on opening, and when it does load it will crash after a few minutes.  Spotify also started streamlining and connecting with Facebook for some reason, so there goes your privacy as wellWish I could rate 0 stars"
"Good BUT. Love spotify but the app really needs a better UI, like a way to save albums for later without it affecting your personal algorithm and recommendations. It needs a way to mark where you are in an album,  like a little green dot on the song where you left off so you can remember where you were. It also needs more mobile functionality like removing playlists, changing the order of songs based on category without going into a hidden menu, having a separate place for followed playlists vs personal. Overall i love the experience but it makes it difficult to be a true music listener for the sake of mediocre simplicity. Lastly the search history should really be much more expansive, it has like 10 previous searches which is a joke when you are constantly looking for music"
"Its ok. Have had lots of issues with downloaded songs not playing when I go away remote bush and away from mobile signals, doesnt cache data properly and only comes back once in mobile signal area. Similar issues when driving round the city going through mobile signal blackspots the songs keep stopping and starting. Youd think if everything was downloaded on device ok there should be no issues playing those songs whether you are in mobile range or not. Would like to see Spotify Karaoke function too to compete with sun karaoke"
"No more offline. Spotify has systematically removed their offline capabilities of this app, I often travel for work and dont have cell signal, they have made it harder and harder to use the app without an internet connection, even when setting it to offline mode it still takes a long time to load playlists or podcasts that should be downloaded, and now you cannot edit playlists while offline. Its a shame..they clearly just want your data as a quib pro quo for using their app even as a paid subscriber for almost a decade"
Spying. We dont want our apps listening to us
"Cant access downloads. When I download something for a trip, I expect that content to be available when I dont have cell service. What is the point of downloading something if I cant access it on a plane or while I dont have service. Something about the app does not work properly. its probably because they want to track what I listen to as much as possible so the app doesnt function properly when service is unavailable. No matter what, I think its so stupid I cant access DOWNLOADED CONTENT without internet access. Definitely needs to be fixed. But Im guessing I dont have Spotify for much longer if that continues"
Pretty good. I really wish the premium wasnt so much. My dad gets mad at me for using data because I use this while riding my horse. It would be awesome if Spotify wouldnt charge for not using data. Good app though
No offline playback on Apple Watch. So you want us to pay to stream which also requires us to pay more for data. Ummm...no thank you? Offline playback on Apple Watch or I dont use the app at all Pandora does it. Why cant Spotify?
Features just keep getting worse. Spotify has become a barrage of AI recommendations and little utility to actually track your own use and listening history. This has only gotten worse with podcasts. I am curious if Spotify will ever get serious about user research for features that are more self directed and empower listeners
"Downloaded music?. I left Apple Music to give Spotify a chance and the one thing I seriously have an issue with is that I cant see specifically the songs Ive downloaded, Ive tried filtering to downloaded and it tells me I have none when Ive downloaded about 10 albums at this point. Consider going back to Apple Music as I prefer playing the songs Ive downloaded so my data doesnt get eaten and I can listen offline. I shouldnt have to make a playlist just to do that "
"Do downloads even do anything?. Even with all of the music I listen to downloaded, only ever playing music from fully downloaded playlists with data saver on and canvas disabled, spotify still manages to use well over 1gb of data per month. Why download my music at all if it will stream the music anyway? I would just leave it in offline mode all the time, but then itll all delete itself after 30 days if I forget. Other than that, great app"
"Best music app, but a few bugs here and there. So i have been using the free version of Spotify for quite some time on my own phone and Premium for my business for about a year. Premium is great dont get me wrong, but at one point you get recommendations of the same playlists and song, and the ones that are actually new and are based on my preferences have nothing to do with the type of music i listen to or have any prefence for what so ever. On the free version you get those videos from time to time with 30 min no ads, but guess what, 5 minutes after i tipically get at least one ad. Is quite annoying really and the main reason i never bought premium for personal use"
"Its still improving. While the Spotify app has had some app bugs in the past, its certainly solved most of them. The main thing for me is that Spotify has a data saver to help lower the data used when streaming. The ironic part about it is that the app still thinks its totally fine to update downloaded playlists on data. So thanks for saving 10 Mb from my streams and then spending 100 Mb downloading music on data instead of waiting until I connect to WiFi? I understand that I dont often open Spotify when on WiFi as I primarily use it on my commute, but a notification to connect to WiFi to update downloaded playlists could easily solve this issue. Even with this minor issue that likely doesnt affect very many users, Spotify is indisputably the best music streaming service there is"
"No VPN use allowed. I have ExpressVPN and Spotify will not play any podcast unless I disconnect from my VPN on iOS.  I would give it zero stars if I could. Its not even a good app platform.Spotify does not want me to have Internet privacy while using their product.  I was never planning on using Spotify, I only got Spotify to listen to Joe RoganI had to deleted it off my iPhone. Sorry Joe, no can-do"
Suppression of free ideas thought. Im Deleting Your app  per your decisions on Jan 3.  You are inciting division by virtue signaling and America does not need that and I dont need your App ( or data mining)
"Trash integration, UX is a bottom priority. Integration with apple watch, bluetooth controls, and lock screen are all fundamentally broken, presumably because they can&#39;t be included in a cross-platform library and would require actual dev time to correctly implement.One fun new development I&#39;ve noticed recently is that accessing a downloaded album during poor connectivity forces you to wait for the api request to time out (60-120 seconds) before you can see the album view. Spotify doesn&#39;t give two shakes of a bug&#39;s hog about your UX. Gotta record those listen counts and analytics events in real time, batching that data is for losersIn conclusion, Apple Music is affordable and available on all platforms"
Loving Spotify. Spotify always comes in handy. Even if Im low on data I can play my downloaded Songs.  My kids and I can personalize it. So its basically one gift that keeps giving all the time
"Its good but. I love the app so I decided to get Spotify premium but when I got it for some reason I cant download songs and the arrows just stay gray, I have over 1GB of data and I still cant access it"
Download music. You should let us download music so we can listen in the car and not wast Data or if we dont even have data like me
Unknown Users Logging Into Account. Ive had Spotify for 2 days now and have received 5 emails (yes 5 emails in 2 days) about unknown users logging into my account from all over the US and other countries. I have changed my password so many times I dont even know what it is currently and cant log into my account. Ive had Pandora for 10+ years and this has never happened. How in 2 days can multiple users access my info? This app feels incredibly unsafe and I am uninstalling it from my phone completely
"Let me default to private playlists. Also Bans content. Dont show everyone every playlist I make. Make money some other way, you privacy invading freaks.Dont ban my podcasts. And its not even a ban, the episodes are up, you just deleted their artist page. Horrible app"
Data collected for sale. App collects more data then needed to sell to advertisers and other 3rd parties
This app is garbage. Spotify is actually garbage. I cant listen to my downloaded songs without needed data?? Nothings downloading properly. Nothings working
Sends Information to Other Companies. Really disappointed to find out they send your info to Facebook. App crashed recently due to a bug that Facebook had. Why? Why do you need to violate our privacy like that? Wont be using your services anymore
"Hacked account. My account gets hacked on a regular basis. I contact Spotify and they reset my account and it never fixes the problem. Within a week people are back on my personal Spotify account using it as their own. This has happened to me 8-10 times and has yet to be fixed. I like Spotify thats why Ive tried to ignore the situation, but its frustrating that my information is being hacked through the Spotify platform"
"In the car. I have had Spotify for 4 years plus but recently subscribed as it wasnt great in my car. Now it is and when I hear a track or see an advert, I download it and select it as I choose. I like the compilations of artists or the NOW series. Great idea and easy to use and navigate. I have loads of folders with hours of music I like. Thanks Spotify xx Carolyn in Spain"
"Fumbles simple functionality, buggy. Across multiple versions and devices, the spotify app has proven infuriating for me. It offers a queueing system like any of the other streaming apps, but it&#39;s really difficult to communicate how bad this one is. Moving a track up next will frequently cause the app to freeze or crash, very annoying if you&#39;re playing music for more than just yourself. Sometimes the queue will inexplicably just be inaccessible, unclickable (deeply frustrating). Again, this has persisted across two new iphones, multiple re-downloads, and regular updates"
"Why download music. This app has me very frustrated. I spend a lot of time driving in and out of cell service so I download all the music I want to listen to. However, even though the music is downloaded, Spotify will still try to use cellular data to listen to a downloaded song? Since I usually only have weak cell service it means the downloaded song and album wont load. The only way to make it load is to put my phone in airplane mode and then itll play the downloaded songs no problem. Furthermore it used 50mb of cell data for a half hour drive listing to songs that I already downloaded Why is Spotify using my cell data to play songs that are downloaded. What is the point of downloading the songs This issue has been ongoing for a year or so and Ive finally been frustrated enough to write a review. Spotify, please fix this otherwise I am going to have to use a different app"
"The Power of Music. SPOTIFY is simply wizardry. To anyone who lived in the 90s its like having HMV & MTV in the palm of your hand. Tunes for any/every occasion. Love my personal playlists and recommend tracks, never fails to satisfy my need for music as and when I desire.     easy 5 star review. Keep up the good work Spotify. Happy subscriber"
"Spotify review. Vast selection , easily accessed , swift download, easily navigate through selections, no lag between track playing, pretty much all anyone can want from a music app"
"Better than Apple Music. I can actually download music here and go off the grid, but apple is a data drainer and didnt fully download in the way spotify doessuperior product. apple you had your chance with me as a music consumer"
Stupid things you have to pay for. Why would I have to pay to skip a song and to listen off WiFi Im just using data
"Dropping playback. I love Spotifyhence why I subscribe. But, these last few days - on wi-fi or cellular data, itll drop playback of songs, downloaded or not. It doesnt happen all the time..but, enough to drive someone insane"
"Please Enable Access for DenonDJ and PioneerDJ Proucts. Im a Long time supporter (4yr old account) first time reviewer, old school dj rediscovering love for music. Ive built a substantial playlist with Spotify. Own 300 shares of SPOT (ouchQ4) i believe in this brand you just need to stay ahead by making sure your platform is seen and known in all music festivals and events. Enabling access for DJs pro and home a like you cement your place in this new economy.I would gladly increase my premium if i could use Spotify over Tidal in my DenonDJ Prime4. I would love access to high quality content for personal and recreational use. Why cant i edit my profile on the iphone app? Would it be possible to add a picture in my profile?"
"My app has been unstable. I was on Amazon Music forever. Never had an issue. I was told that Spotify is a better experience and decided to give it a shot.In the week that I have had the app, I have been impressed at the ease of use and the streaming quality.... when the app works.I have only been able to keep the app open half the time. Consistently crashing, I have run every troubleshooting idea the internet has (app up to date, delete and reinstall, restart phone, cell data vs WiFi, etc.)I cant imagine why I would want to continue to pay for a service that I am unable to use"
Uses gobs of data. I find it unfortunate when the music wont load but your ads sure will
"Normally 5 stars, bc Spotify rocks my socks. Normally would be 5 stars, but, using the &#34;Radio&#34; option in my fav largest playlist (3,000+ tracks) for the last 3+ years, (I pointed this out to Spotify over 3 years ago) STILL plays only the SAME 100+- songs Why is Spotify using such a limited algorithm? ?With over 3000 different songs in my playlist to mix up my music - Spotify instead plays the same songs,over and over Why?"
"Updates. Spotify would be good if the last update didnt wipe my data and make me have to log in again. Except I tried logging back in again and it didnt work. It never sent me the Email, I had to change my password just for it to not work, and now I have 0 access to any of my playlist. All of this happened shortly after the last update"
Spotify Hacked. Someone else is using my Spotify I have changed my password 3 time and logged out of all devices yet they still somehow able to access my account. Ive been a premium member for years now and Im just ready to say forget it and take my money elsewhere
"Last Update as of June 24th 2020. Everything is great, but the personal artist section would be better if you guys just left it to what we already saved. Taking us to their page is backwards productive for us if we saved some music from them and have to go look for it. 5 star app. But Id have to give it 4 until you guys change it back "
A small suggestion. I really like the app and the premium is really worth it.What I would like to see is a feature where you could distinguish your public playlists from your private ones without going into the playlist. Adding an indicator on the playlist thumbnail or something like that would do the job.It is a bit of a difficult process when you have a lot of playlists and youre trying to edit the privacy settings on them
Fraudulent. I never had this app on my phone its not in my subscriptions but they are stealing money from my visa
"Was hacked several times, Spotify refused to do anything about it. My paid account was hacked several times last year messing up all my songs and playlists and favorite songs. I changed my passwords several times to no avail. I reached out out to Spotify because no options on the app were given to fix the problem. This to me looks like lax safety by a company that accepts payment for services. Now I feel wary to give them my credit card info again. Still, No one reached out to me"
"Glitchy and inconsistent. Overall I like what Spotify has to offer. I pay for the subscription service, but on both android and iPhone it struggles to stay connected or work properly when connecting through chrome cast. It freaks out, skips through or past songs and doesnt display information correctly (my phone will show the song at 1:30 played, but the tv screen will show 3:46 which is wrong). I dont even know how that could happen if its just supposed to be mirroring data. This has not gotten worse or better with any update"
Downloading. Big fan of Spotify but when I download podcasts to listen to later they automatically play them off of my data. Whenever I hit bad cell service it stops playing. Basically defeats the purpose in my opinion
"You wont need another music app. Ive been using Spotify for several years now, and it has never ceased to amaze me. I dont know what kind of data analysis wizardry is going on behind the scenes but I suspect theyve mastered the art of music taste prediction and categorization. With adjustment to Discover Weekly, Ive found some of my favorite songs of all time. If you like finding new music easily (and by easily I mean they do it for you), then look no further"
"vs. Apple Music. Ive been an Apple Music subscriber for a little over 2 years. I have the entire APPLE ECOSYSTEM and it just made sense. But, as a music lover (indie rock, electronic, pop, dance, and RB mostly) SPOTIFY gets me so much more on a personal level. It constantly recommend music that I actually enjoy based on an algorithm that takes tracks and artist that I like and matches me with similar artist and tracks. Unlike APPLE MUSIC, which only matches based on what I feel is genre and new artists that fall in the same genre and are currently #1 in some some APPLE MUSIC playlist or global charts. Its a generic recommendation based on overall popularity and not the real spirit of the music I enjoy. APPLE MUSIC may have a bigger song library, but SPOTIFY has all those hidden gems you never even knew you were missing out on. SPOTIFY is for the music collectors and discoverers"
"Music undownloads itself without reason- no point in paying for sub. Spotify is one of the big three when it comes to music playing platforms (Apple Music, YouTube, Spotify) but its quality is plummeting.The only reason I pay for a subscription is so I can download music and not waste data while playing music on the go. Spotify has this glitch where it undownloads your music for you without rhyme or reason. Its super annoying to go out for the day and find out that half of your lists have undownloaded themselves. To make things worse, should you choose to bite the bullet and use data to redownload your missing music, the app suddenly acts like it has no idea what the download option is at all. Its a waste of cellular data, storage space, money and time"
Love ability to share - Data privacy concern. The ability to prep playlists and share them is great. Super easy and enjoying lots of premade listsConcerned about data collection and sharing of my personal information
"Killing my phone and my data limit and offensive recommendations. Great app But recently its been using up 41GB of data for 20 min of predownloaded music Also its killing my battery Lastly the recommended songs section/songs for you is coming up with some really stupid recommendations. Ive had one or two recommendations which I find really offensive and not what Id ever listen to. Please fix or remove this feature, its really dodgie and I often have to restart the app several times to get rid of the albums with offensive names or covers which I would never want to listen to"
"Spotify. I love Spotify and the range of different types of music it offers and recommends. I also really enjoy the yearly playlists. However, I do not appreciate the quality being lowered. The quality sound of the music has significantly decreased and I do not find that adequate for the amount of money that is paid for it monthly. Furthermore, I would appreciate it if Spotify would stop selling personal information about musical preferences etc. to other companies, as this is highly intrusive to peoples privacy"
money moves. you only put ads on because you want people to get annoyed by it and force them to buy premium wasting data without premium just make it an online music and cant be played offline without premium
Its ok just to many adverts and should be able to play with no data. Its ok just too many adverts and should be able to play with no data
"What the heck. The app is great and everything, I love it. But, why does it show your friends what song you are listening to? I know its only on desktop version but wth? I bought privacy was a thing on this app. Guess its only for playlists"
I love Spotify so much. You can save albums you can transfer your data you can save your songs you can find new music was a recommended I highly recommend it and hope you have a great day
Amazing. I like Spotify due to being able to play music while not needing data so long you download the music before hand
"Spotify review. Ive been chasing music technology from behind for decades (record albums, 8-track, cassette, cd, etc) so, as much as I hate cliches, Spotifier is game changer. Now I have all the music I ever wanted"
I have Premium for years. And one day Turned in Free account settings when use it on mobile data just because . 
"THE NEW UPDATE IS AWFUL. You need to go back to how the spotify looked, theres no alphabetical scroll, the home page is more cluttered now because the recently played is there, and since i have my data off I cant listen to my recently played when im in the car or whatever, also i dont know why its liked it songs instead of a list of just all downloaded songs its stupid, switch back to the old set up please im begging you. On top of all of It wont allow me to create playlists"
Data/wifi. I love this app its wonderful for music I just think it would be better if you guys make it easier to download sing when you have no data/wifi.
"The Developers Ruined Casting. Casting is now completely ruined. For whatever reason, Spotify felt that it would be a good idea to make your phone a remote for Spotify Connect, even when youre casting music to speakers. Guess what? In doing so, your phone activity now interrupts casting. THIS IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT CASTING IS SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE. When casting over wifi, you are supposed to be able to use your device(s) independently from the speaker playing the music. Now, for example, if Im watching a YouTube video on my phone while casting music and I want to change the volume, the music playback devices changes its volume with my phone controls. I have contacted Spotify countless times and they dont care at all about fixing their screw-up. Not only is it horribly inconvenient, but it is a blatant override of my phones settings and an overstep into my own privacy, since they can make the app continue to operate even when its been force-quit and background activity is turned off"
Spotify is Spotify. Nonstop recommendations and a ui tailored around giving you new music at a touch but makes you tap 3 times to listen to music you saved. Also great discounts for students and people who want Hulu. I like Spotify but if I had unlimited data Id be using YouTube
Stop changing Tracks. I did not intend to leave a bad review on Spotify I love this app and use it everyday for hours but a few things really piss me off with this app. Firstly if I make a playlist with a song multiple times it means I really want to listen to it so please play it and also stop playing songs that arent in my playlist if I didnt put them there then I means I dont want to listen to them. Those unwanted songs play more than the wanted. Like the suggestive track for me is useless I dont want those songs and I dont have the money to pay for premium Im only in Highschool and no one else in my family uses Spotify
"An elegant waste of time and an invasion of privacy. Pandora is free, easier to use, and doesn\'t mine your data. Apps should never need access to your Facebook. Also good luck trying to delete your account, they won\'t allow you. You\'re signed up for life.Content is decent. I like the availability of interviews with fascists and white supremacists"
"Time to move on. Spotify is just has become almost unusable for me.  I listen offline because I dont have much data and Ive been having so many issues with the app, Im exploring other options.   In offline mode now I cant access my library and if I do it takes several minutes. If I forget to turn on offline mode I cannot access my music at all because apparently the songs have to re-download every time I use the stupid thing.   If I download content why is it not on my phone?  The shuffle is a flat joke. Several other small usability issues that bug me.  Probably switching to amazon since I already pay for it.  If you want to use Spotify for offline use, look elsewhere"
Disappointing App Ruins Service. Im almost ready to cancel my spotify because of how often songs - even my downloaded tracks just stop playing. I have to reinstall the app nearly monthly and its just not worth it anymore. What a shame the tech is killing a perfectly good business
Maybe when YouTube dies. Spotify is fun IF you get premium if NOT you will be bombarded with ads more than YouTube The one good thing is it does not use that much data. But Spotify Im not paying your $1.99 premium cost . This is America And aint no buddy have time for that
"Never had a problem until recently. I love using Spotify whenever I get the chance, mainly in the car driving to work Unfortunately with recent updates, there now seems to be a bug which doesnt allow the track info to be updated on screen of my BMW, the song will change forwards and back, but the Artist, song title, album art work, and album title will all be stuck to whatever was playing first (which is no major issue, but if Im listening to playlists I cant see whats playing if its a new song Ive found)"
Maybe back to Apple Music. I have full internet access but cannot play anything on Spotify except tracks I have downloaded. No point paying for something that does not deliver
"Update on July 9,2021 erased my privacy settings. Had all my privacy settings on private. The most recent update made all my playlists Public And there is no easy way to put them back besides doing it one by one. Not cool Fix this bug ASAP please"
Horrible. Always an ad ever song you play and it does not let you make a play list dont use this app it can also have access to personal info
Spying on you. They just got approved for a patent to listen to you through your microphone. Beware
5star review. I love how I can not use my data and that there is so many music options
"Used to be better. Spotify used to be my #1 platform for listening to music, but the past few months the issues keep piling up. My IOS app never connects to wifi, so I have to use all my data to get anything downloaded. The new update made it so that the app takes internet to access any downloaded podcast episodes. If I am driving through an area with no connection, I cant even access my downloaded episodes. The newest update completely changed how I had my music organized, so it is hard to find a specific playlist. Not sure why the app is so unreliable now, but I dont recommend Spotify for mobile music and podcasts"
Hacked needs to be more secure. I love spotify I wish I could still have it but after my account was hacked and my card information was stolen. Im very upset they deleted my email and put theres and thankfully I was still logged in on my MacBook. I replaced all my information I took my card off of there I called my bank to freeze my card. And got a new card. Thankfully I caught it early so it wasnt able to do some serious damage to my bank account. Spotify needs to be more secure and less hackable. I love using Spotify premium but its not worth my account being hacked and my card information being stolen. This is been happening with multiple people
What u like about it. I like how you can listen to music and you only need to watch a few ads and I listen to Spotify alit but sometimes when I run out of data but I listen to it in the car with my mum and it has any sing Jojo siwa and wiggles and sleep music name it you can play it so if you have not downloaded it then what are you doing download it you will lose stress and Iam listening to it while Iam writing this 
"Alex Jones?. Loved Spotify until they gave a platform to Newtown shooting conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan podcast. Thats about 95% reason why Im deleting the app. But heres more reasons:Spotify also failed to retain top Ringer talent/creative genius Jason Concepcion after acquiring The Ringer. Thanks for future seasons of Binge Mode :(Lastly, Ive recently read about the data Spotify is collecting on listeners and selling it. Switching to Apple Music and podcasts for the privacy policies/protections"
"Data Ripoff. I dont think, its necessary to reshuffle my playlist which keep making me to re-download my playlist every few days. It drain my data every time . This is absolutely a data-ripoff after paying for monthly subscription. "
Shame on Spotify It uses Facebook to track you and constantly crashes. Shame on Spotify. I used to love Spotify. But somewhere in the ton of updates they started to use Facebook software. It crashes and constantly gives errors. Not to mention Facebook tracks what you listen to and all ur basic info to sell to advertisers. Shame on Spotify
"Please add this function. Spotify has been my favorite music app for years, Ive had premium since I was in middle school. Never had a problem until recently when I noticed that there is no option to choose when the songs you wish to download. This is vital for users like me who have limited wifi bandwidth and limited data, because while I would like to download my playlists and songs, I cant always afford to download them while I am at home. Please at the option to pause downloads"
"I THOUGHT this app would be better. I had gotten this app so I could listen to music anytime, but boy was I wrong. I need WiFi to listen unless Im using data, i cant choose my songs in my playlists like I want to, I cant go back to a song sometimes, and I HAVE LIMITED SKIPS? All I ask now is.. WHY? I heard so many good things but I cant stand this app anymore. Before the update I enjoyed Spotify, but now all I have to say is ugh"
"I like the app but. I like it a lot but it really shouldnt kick you off when someone else is listening to music, I hate having to the off my data when my dad is listen to music at the same time"
Theft. I love paying to stream music offline and then when Im connected to internet or using data nothing will play What a rip off
Data. Hate that my data has to be on for songs Ive added. Awful
Yep. This app prevents my from going over my data plan I Love it And I can download all of my favourite songs
"Spotify App. Best for music, pretty much find any track and it work without data or WiFi"
ADD BLOCK FEATURE. please add a block feature for users who are following us. it adds a sense of privacy
Downloaded and liked songs wont play. My downloaded songs wont play without data and half the songs I pick in my liked playlist just dont do anything. What is going on with Spotify recently
"App is so frustrating but I love the service. I love so much about Spotify but I find it so frustrating to use at times. Some songs just absolutely will not play. Any other song, no problem, but a certain track absolutely will not get past 10s in. Also I wish I could add recent searches to my queue or get to them without immediately playing them"
Always deletes data. Im so fed up Im writing a review. For months now the app thinks it doesnt have any songs downloaded when I disconnect from WiFi or cell for even a few minutes. Its ridiculous because I have 60+ gb of music downloaded and pay a premium for Spotify Premium. When it connects again you can see the app recognize it has the songs in storage because it will count through downloading 10k plus songs in under 5 seconds. This is unacceptable. Please fix this bug
Terrible ethics. Not going to use a company that validates fake information
Its a really good app. Spotify is a really good app because u can download songs and once u have downloaded the songs u want u can listen to them anywhere without wasting your data
"I love Spotify. Listening to music on Spotify is really great, having podcasts in the app is really great as well. There are some features I miss and I wish could be added though. I dont think theres the option to see what friends are listening to when on the mobile version, like you can do on desktop, I like that feature. I also kind of miss being able to see who follows my playlists, I understand it can be hard to accommodate functionality and privacy, I just miss the feature. This is truely a great app though"
"Two Things. Basically what every single other review says (yes, I read some).  The suggested track thing is retarded, however, I have found if you have around twenty songs on your playlist there arent any suggested tracks you are forced to use your skips on.  The second thing is a major issue.  My music stops randomly.  Just in the middle of songs.  And when you go back into the app (when your doing other things and just have the window open you know?) it has to reload which makes you listen to the song from the start and this also takes up skips because I dont want to listen to the same song on repeat, if I wanted that Id go to Apple Music.  If you delete the app and reinstall it, it fixes this for about two hours, but then it continues again.  And before anyone says, Its because you just have the window open and youre doing other things, NO ITS NOT BECAUSE THATS WHAT I THOUGHT TOO  Ive done experiments on this.  It doesnt matter what I do or where I am or if Im on wifi or data, it still does it.  The only reason I have Spotify is to listen to music while doing other things on the same device, but if this continues, Im just going to delete it.  Whats the point of having it if it just glitches every five seconds?  Its been going on for three months now, almost four.  Fix it.  Please.       Thanks"
"Private collaborative playlists please. I have a using Spotify for years and absolutely love the platform. I have collaborative playlist with my husband and some friends, but lately Ive had random people follow and add a bunch of songs to our personal shared playlists. I would like to keep them collaborative and also keep the randoms out. "
"NEEDS SEPARATE QUALITY FOR WIFI AND CELLULAR. This is the second time it&#39;s killed my data for the month because I put it back to acceptable streaming quality while I was on wifi, and forgot to put it back on data saver before I left.While talking about streaming, WHY DOES THIS NOT SUPPORT LOSSLESS YET. Tidals search function is useless to the point of being inoperable or else I&#39;d still be using that. Spotify has been around more than long enough to support streaming in the same quality as something that&#39;s been around for 40 years (CDs).Also the interface is cluttered and frustrating in the car. There are so many features that get in the way. All I want is to be able to scroll through my albums in alphabetical order. Same for my artists. I don&#39;t need all these other tabs, or a homescreen, or for the settings button to be buried. Or for streaming quality to be buried too.The whole interface is garbage and I hate this app. I only use it because it&#39;s extremely convenient and the search works at all, unlike tidal. 320Kb/s mp3 quality for $10/month is trash"
"Its an ok app. I like the app for many of reasons. It has most songs on there but some arent findable.The ads do get annoying when you dont have premium but if you get rid of the app than go back on the app the ad that you had on leaves and you your music. You can make your own playlist or listen to someone elses. You can follow people. When you make your own playlist, Spotify sometimes adds music to the playlist which you than have to get rid of. If you dont have premium, when you listening to the app offline, you have to have your mobile data on. Other than that I find it a really good app and do recommend to any music fan"
liked songs. it doesnt let me open my liked songs when my data is off even when i have premium
"Separate Music from Podcasts on your app. I used to love spotify&#39;s app but recently it has become almost unusable, especially for non-premium members. The latest update which combined music and podcasts together is very confusing, difficult, and honestly just ugly to navigate. I especially dislike that in order to access my downloaded content for offline listening, I have to be....online to access it?? It literally does not make sense. Many folks do not have access to stable data or even wifi connections and we rely on being able to access our offline content OFFLINE in order to keep using your services. Very disappointing how little thought was put into this by your developers"
"Good music app. I like Spotify, but I have a problem. My Canvas doesnt work. Data saver turned off. Ive tried to use VPN to resolve this problem, but it didnt help me. Please help me with it"
Spotify CarPlay. So I love Spotify.. I have premium and use it in the car via Apple CarPlay but now I cant select my own playlists off the screen unless theyre in the recently played folder And when I do choose a playlist I cant scroll through to find a track I want..  yes its not advisable while driving but a passenger could previously... also why not have a song search button on the screen??
"Read this Ad (probably going to be removed anyways). This app is good except for the fact that the ads are all the time and not &#34;every 30 min&#34;Thats what I would say if I didnt have Spotify premium. Without ads, this app functions spectacularly. A stellar ability in creating a vast amount of playlists. Customizing the audio output is well done. There are only a few complaints I have as a frequent user of Spotify. -recommended playlists are rather arbitrary to personal preference-customization of the apps color scheme-automatic download of new songs to previously downloaded playlists (should have option)-recommend options to Buy music through the app -expensive monthly costThese are mostly personal nagging complaints. Overall, the best music app Ive had"
Wow i didnt expect this much. This app is amazing coming from somone without spotify premium download now
"Oh no. Spotify you are the only app I would never delete, Im so sorry last.fm for all the stupid data you have to collect. Best app ever, except it crashes like once a week so. Also please make ur own playlists/songs you listen to/playlists you saved priority when searching"
"Best streaming service. Spotify is hands down the best way to listen to music. Its great for making playlists to set moods and also for finding new stuff to listen to My only complaint is that the shuffle is annoying. Spotify will shuffle the songs you listen to most in a playlist to the front and play those first, but that means if you have a list with 100 songs and only have time to listen to 10, youre gonna hear the same 7 or 8 songs every time you start the playlist. This happens to me every time I make a new playlist, without fail. I hate it. My Liked Songs playlist has 1000 songs on it but I never listen to it cause it only shows me the same 15 songs it always does, so what is the point? If I wanted to listen to the list in order or hear specific songs, I would do that. When I hit shuffle, its because I want the order to be random and I want an equal chance to hear any song on the list Shuffling this way means Im unlikely to hear newly added tracks, which kind of defeats the purpose of adding new tracks to the playlist at all. Id really love this fixed"
Tracking. Was a premium subscriber. Just deleted because you guys wont stop bullying me into tracking with your stupid banner that shuts me out of the app. Your loss. The last thing I need is more ads in my life
"The things you find when youre not looking . This platform has ripped me away from obsessively following my so called favourite bands since being a child. Theres so much more to be heard when you stop listening too hard. Keep it coming  If this is the so called Big Brother monitoring and profiling my data and info then sooooo be it  Life is for living and all music makes it easier to love the life you live  Couldve been iTunes , couldve been Apple Music, couldve been You Tube But it wasnt ... it was Spotify You sit down, you put your ear phones in and you hear and thats the game.Ive on average another 35 years to live  Spotify got me first  Thanks a million"
Spotify. It good but u no no download so u have to use data which is bad because I cant listen to soviet feem tune in the swimming pool ):
"Bad. Spotify has a terrible report system, I find tracks with hentai as the picture and no way to report, also I made a playlist and it isnt playing any of the sounds on it when I click play on the playlist"
Premium says Im offline and wont let me play music when Im connected to data. Not sure why this is happening but its annoying af and so is trying to get through to their customer support. Aside from that its great
"Rogan on Spotify. I guess it had to come. We had so many great episodes of content. I dont like the Spotify app. Always asking me to subscribe and killing my data. Please Joe, rip up that contract and go back on your own"
Bs. I feel like Im not getting the satisfaction of using my app without data
Its good. Spotify is an amazing music app but people login and can steal your info easy
"Would like more features. Ive been using Spotify for about 5 years now. In that time, the app has evolved very little. Thank god for adding lyrics recently  That said, its still hard to get proper info about the track youre listening (year, composers, musicians etc.) Also the playlist system is surprisingly messy. The more playlists I create, the harder it becomes to navigate. There should be a way to sort playlists into categories. Finally, it would be nice to have a better social media experience on the platform when visiting a friends page"
"No Help. Spotify has been super encouraging podcasts so i tried it out and immediately started having issues with the app, randomly it&#39;ll close and lose track of what i was doing every 2 minutes or so, and through 4 or 5 months of going to support they&#39;ve offered the same thing each time, once was asked  just to delete my account. The issue stopped when i stopped using the app for a month for apple music and youtube but all my playlist are on spotify so"
"Spotify is #1 for music streaming. Spotify is certainly the most superior music streaming service available and with a reasonable price why wouldnt you switch? Apple Music is no competition Spotify gets all the freshest tracks you could want with tons of indie and upcoming artists. The more popular tracks even have information on the artist and lyrics for the more nerdy bunch like myself  Not sure what to listen to? Theres a plethora of playlists based on moods, genres, times of day, activities, places, zodiac signs, and times in history made by Spotify and other music lovers like you. Trust, Spotify will not disappoint"
New update issues. The new update wont allow me to access my downloaded songs as a premium user when off data
"Please update. I love Spotify and its my main source of music and podcasts. However, I am this close to switching to Apple Music. With the past two updates, I will put a playlist on shuffle and itll play the first 10 seconds of the song and then suddenly stop as if I closed the app. I thought it mightve been just my phone but my fiancé has had the same issues with both of the past two updates. The pause button makes it look like the song is still playing but its not. The other issue Ive noticed this update is that I cannot get my downloaded playlists to play offline. It only worked with data turned on. Normally thats not a big deal but unfortunately the phone plan Im on isnt with unlimited data. Really disappointing I cant use one of my favorite apps as much as Id like"
"Constant re-downloading & lack of lyricd. I have thousands of songs on playlists downloaded for offline listening, but Spotify will un-download hundreds of songs at random intervals, making me stream on data or re-download at home.Also, no lyrics available in-app like Apple Music"
"Great App. Only have two problems with it and one was almost solved. Compared to Apple Music, I have a hard time on Spotify looking for the music I previously played, it doesnt really keep a history behind the queue. The second problem I had at first was that theres no lyrics option. That was recently fixed but isnt quite complete, in order for it to really be better is tracking the lyrics and even be functional (switching lines when pressed). Other than that I love the interface and the recommendations are amazing"
"Not great. Spotify used to be amazing Now its just ad after ad. You cant search through specific albums anymore. When I tried to upgrade, I discovered a fraudulent account that had my info and card. When I tried to cancel it took an hour to find some means of communication with the company for help. No phone number. No email. Just a chat link that you only find when youve been clicking on page after page for an hour. I was going to just cancel the fraud account and upgrade my own account, but after that nightmare I refuse to give any of my money to this company. Its a shame. I used to love Spotify and how I could explore through music and find new stuff. Now you cant"
Amazing :). Spotify is a recommended app for you to listen to all of your favorite songs and podcasts. This app respects my privacy and has so many variety of choices that you can listen to. I very recommend for you to get this app and its free on most devices
"love this app but one issue. ive been using spotify since 2016 and i love it- its so easy to use and i much prefer it to apple music, it feels much more personal and its so great for suggesting new music. i only have one issue with the app as a whole, and even the issue is a little unimportant. my problem is how difficult it is to change the playlist picture please spotify all i want is to choose my own picture as the cover for my playlist, i was so excited to change it when i got a new laptop, but even then i couldnt do it- something about being a rockstar? anyway, amazing app, definitely the best option to choose from but would love it if i could change the playlist cover"
"Good app but could be better. In my opinion you could add one thing to make Spotify better, a sistem that identifies music using the cellphone microphone and then comparing the music you recorded with a data base with all the music available in Spotify giving the name of the music to you"
"Sotify is outstanding. As a musician Spotify allows me to access an incredible variety of music literally wherever and whenever I want to hear it. In the past Ive had music collections including record collections of over 1,000 albums and hundreds of CDs.I love making playlist and then downloading the songs to mobile devices. When we practice with the band I can quickly create playlist for sets and or share playlists with the other musicians.I find it indispensable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"only music app i've ever used. been using spotify for over 8 years now and i have to say it's one (if not) my favourite music streaming platforms. the layout is fantastic, and i love how it analyses your music choices and data to prepare personalised playlists for users... i wish artists could he represented a bit more on the platform, however, from a consumer's perspective it's amazing. even has podcasts, etc"
Besides all the privacy leaks. Pretty perfect besides all the security breaches. But hey people still go to target
"Garbage update. Ever since this update I can no longer go to an artist that I follow and listen to the music that Ive liked from them. I can only see their ENTIRE discography and have to choose &amp; play each album separately instead of being able to let all the albums Ive liked from them play back to back. Its literally impossible to just set your phone down and let the music play how you want it to, I now have to interact with my phone 5x more and keep going into the app to change albums/songs. Youve taken nearly all the personal preferences away in this app"
"Deleted 90% of my downloaded music?. I have use Spotify for a long time and have burned through lots of data gigs downloading music to my phone, only to see it all vanish in a flash. I should be refunded for the data that was waisted. And now Im about to embark on a 3 week trip to sea with hardly anything to listen to. Sorry to drop a low rating but this is a huge issue. I will definitely explore other options. I have spent almost $1000 on my subscription since I started using Spotify in 2015. Just baffled at this"
UX. One of the best uses of user data to create a better personalized experience of any major app
"Kind of annoyed. Ive been using Spotify for over a year now, and I really like it. The only complaint I have is that it doesnt play songs from my suggested track. Whenever I tap a playlist and press shuffle, (yes I dont have Spotify premium cause Im broke) it plays random songs from an artist I dont even know. I tried refreshing the app, but it kept playing random songs that I didnt even know. I even tried powering off my phone, but it didnt work, and know I cant even get my phone to play the playlist is want. Please respond to this soon. ~Cara_Lovegood"
"Used to be a 5 star, fix the app. I don&#39;t know if I am the only one with this issue, but I tend to listen to my music in offline mode to conserve data usage. So I download albums to my phone so that I can listen to them at any time. For the first few months this feature worked perfectly. I could change songs in my car quickly with the controls on the steering wheel no problem. Then all of a sudden it stopped letting me play songs in offline regardless of the setting being on or not. I would turn on an album and then hit next and the album would just stop playing. At first it only happened once but now this happens about 50% of the time. Its frustrating when you pay for a service that only works half the time. Hopefully it is fixed soon because I genuinely want to keep using spotify"
"Limited. from what I expected from such a highly rated app. I cant access my own personal songs or go through playlist that I have already liked previously freely. Having to limited freedom to not actively choose songs but instead must swipe past them and only given a limited number of swipes. Additionally you can not back track on a song. The songs that I have liked when selected only give me samples . I have to select the shuffle to even listen to my list at all. Disappointing, that makes this app comparable to pandora. :("
"Give users authority to block/remove followers they don't want following them. Until this feature is added, I can&#39;t rate the app higher than a two. It&#39;s such a basic feature and one that should have been there from the get go. Think of all the possibilities where this would be crucial - an ex following you for example. Everyone deserves the right to privacy and the right to remove followers when they feel uncomfortable having their eyes on what they&#39;re listening to. Music is emotional and personal.Please wise up and finally give users this feature. It&#39;s BEYOND overdue. I&#39;m furious in 2021 you&#39;ve still not made it a priority to correct this This is UNACCEPTABLE"
Problem. I share an account with another person and we cant listen to music at the same time even with data off
"Wish I could rate 0. I genuinely really enjoyed spotify in the beginning but as the years went by i've seen the app  get worse. Songs never load, even if they're downloaded. The app glitches too much to the point where i'm waiting 30 minutes for a loading screen to show me my playlists and liked songs. I thought it might be a network issue since that's always something to keep in mind but even with wifi and cellular data the app glitches. There are some songs that still don't play. Even if I download /undownload. I try everything and it never works. I just want to listen to music but at this point I regret paying for a subscription. There are a lot of cute quirks on the app but i'm more interested in actually stream and listen to songs. If I can't even play a song what's the point. Ranting here but this is ridiculous"
"Its good, needs some work though. This is a great app, cant deny it, although it could be improved. While I get that you have to put certain restrictions on certain things depending on wether or not you have premium, I think certain things still need to be available to those who may not have it. Take for instance not being able to pick whatever song you want, having to listen to it with wifi or phone data, or only being able to skip 6 songs a hour, I believe one of those should be removed, as it could deter people from the app"
Constantly removes downloads. The whole point of me paying for this is so I dont need to use data to listen to full albums when I dont have access to WiFi. I have to repeatedly download albums bc the app is continuously removing my albums after they are downloaded. Im trialing Apple Music now in preparation of canceling this service
Ok but. The app is overall great but in my opinion is just a waste unless u have Spotify premium. I am fine with the ads and the limited skips but the thing I hate most is the suggested songs and you cannot listen off line without premium. My play list just gets a bunch of random songs that I do not want to listen to and if I have a short playlist I just end up with a bunch of them. I also cannot listen off line with out premium so unless you are using a hotspot or data forget about listening on a car ride or other trip. I gave it 3 stars for the wide verity of songs and its easy to use interface but I think that the extra songs which I do not want is really what does it for me
"Dont get. This dumb app keeps logging me out and saying my information isnt valid, when it is"
"downloaded music. I love spotify, I can search for everything on it. For the passed few days am not able to play my already downloaded music . unless I have data on.?"
"Love the app But. Ok so I absolutely adore this app. It has a lot of options, and stuff. But there is somethings I dont like. although premium does make things better, I find it annoying how tv and iPads and stuff dont have to go through the same thing phone users do.like, I never had limited skips on iPad, but now I do on phone???and, whenever I close Spotify without finishing a playlist? My playlist literally wont restart. It continues playing he suggested track, even though I dont want to listen to it"
Hate. Ive updated this app many times and can not get my downloaded music to play when not on data. Not worth the $$ 
"Picture problem. Ive been a Spotify member for years and these last few months Ive had issues with changing my playlist cover photos and now I cant update my profile picture either. I have done EVERYTHING recommended by Spotifys support page, but nothing has fixed. Im also having issues with my playlists disappearing and all of my offline downloaded songs all of a sudden need re-downloaded. Ive been a fan of this app for so long but Im honestly to the point to where I\'m about to switch to Apple Music. Its ridiculous to have no help in fixing so many errors on the app, yet there are updates all the time. What IS there thats actually been fixed?"
"Love Spotify. Got Spotify on multiple devices, my favorite is probably my cheap Walmart phone I added my account to and mounted to my bike. Download my music on WiFi then turn it off and later I can still have all my music. Without wasting my personal phone battery"
"Love this app But the ads mess up sometimes. I have been using Spotify for about 2 years, and I definitely recommend this app for anyone looking for a good free music app I have never purchased premium where you dont have ads and you can choose whatever song youd like at anytime. So, I have to listen to ads. I dont mind it, however, recently Ive noticed that when Im offered the option to watch an ad for 30 minutes of no ads, the video plays, the music keeps playing but, the screen stops showing on my lock screen that music is playing and after a while it glitches and I have to turn my music off. Now, I dont know if this is just something wrong with my personal device, but its been happening repeatedly for a while now. So, if youre planning on getting the app without purchasing premium, just be aware of the ads Other than that, this app is amazing and has a huge selection of songs"
"Amazing. I think that Spotify is a great app to put music on. It has a lot less ads and you can skip a lot more than Pandora. It also doesnt ask for your personal information. In pandora, it asks for your email, address, and etc. In Spotify, You just need your email and for you to make a password. Its very simple. It has wonderful podcasts and its very clear. I love how you can search users using spotify and their playlists. So if you thinking of downloading this and using it, then its a great app"
FAR below satisfactory. The app only allows you to skip a certain amount of songs before it makes you pay. It also adds songs to your personal playlist and dont let you remove them. This app is NOT user friendly. Why cant we just listen to the songs we like? Huh?
"Cannot Clear Recently Played From iPhone. Unbelievable that there is no longer any way to clear recently played music from your iPhone. You now have to go to the desktop version of Spotify to do this, and it will still not clear this history from your phone. The recently played should be called even played once months ago. So if you just listen to a track out of curiosity or accidentally, it doesnt go away. I pay $10 a month for premium service, and the app recommends music based on what Ive listened to. I just spent an hour trying to start with a clean slate. I guess this is not possible anymore. I can imagine some users might also want some privacy for their listening, when others can see their account. While Spotify may have a decent selection of music, the app is no longer very user-friendly. Its become very cluttered, and cumbersome. I had to search online on how to clean up my account and start fresh, only to find out you can no longer do so. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"
Spotify . I dont like when the app plays suggest tracks.We didnt ask for you to do that.So could you put an end to this please and thanks
"Best music platform right now, but could still use a little work. I absolutely love Spotify for its incredible variety of music (ranging from timely classics to new releases and even musicals, etc.) and its relatively simple, aesthetic layout. I use the app every single day and have it on every device, I cant imagine life without it now. Spotify has helped me broaden my taste in music. Ive discovered so much great, new music even by smaller creators/newer artists on the app. Theres so much I love about Spotify, but if I could change one thing it would be to bring back the recently played (or history) function that used to be accessible next to Queue. I sometimes accidentally let a song end before I have to chance to look at its name, and Im saddened when I lose one I really liked. Finding it used to be easy through the recently played function, and I wish it was still available. Spotify, please bring it back  there was nothing wrong with it"
Favourite app. Discover weekly make my Mondays so much better and personal I really liked the idea of Spotify being able to use extra data information about you to make the song suggestions even better. Its a better use of my information than the like of fb &amp; Instagram using it for marketing
"Spotify is an incredible app. I usually cant find apps for the right music. Thats when I heard about Spotify It had ALL the songs I like, and its free to download No password needed"
"Trash. Dont bother if you are hoping to use Spotify on your Apple Watch, it doesnt work at all. For some stupid reason, when you try to play music on your Watch, this app insists on instead playing the music out of the iPhone speakers, not the AirPods connected to the Watch. Why in Gods name would install an app on the Watch.and then want to play it on the IPhone? Are your engineers that dumb? The whole point was to play music on the Watch, offline, without paying $20/month for Watch cellular data or having my phone in the pocket"
"Lovely. I am a minor and I have had this app for a few years now and out of anything, it is my favorite music app. I love the option to make playlists and how you can have your privacy respected. (I find it better to listen to music by having premium.) One of my most favorite parts about it is having Spotify Wrapped once every year and how it reflects. Thanks for listening, I hope you decide to get this app"
"playing random music mid-song. i thought i was the only one having a problem with my music from my playlist shutting off and skipping to a random song thats not in my playlist at all, nor have i ever listened to whoever made the song. i thought that my account got hacked which is actually kinda worrisome since my personal info is linked. but, im gonna keep continuing to use spotify. still gonna give it 5 stars. i really love this app. the skipping is kind of annoying, but tolerable, and i can wait for the big fixthanks"
"Used to be a 5 star. I don&#39;t know if I am the only one with this issue, but I tend to listen to my music in offline mode to conserve data usage. So I download albums to my phone so that I can listen to them at any time. For the first few months this feature worked perfectly. I could change songs in my car quickly with the controls on the steering wheel no problem. Then all of a sudden it stopped letting me play songs in offline regardless of the setting being on or not. I would turn on an album and then hit next and the album would just stop playing. At first it only happened once but now this happens about 50% of the time. Its frustrating when you pay for a service that only works half the time. Hopefully it is fixed soon because I genuinely want to keep using spotify"
"5 stars for functionality but 1 star for the amount of tracking. Wouldve given this 5 stars but with the lack of privacy using this app, it deserves only 1"
Doesnt update in the background. I love spotify as an app and service. I however download playlist to reduce data usage and the app stops downloading if i minimize the app in to the back ground it stops downloading which defeats the purpose
"10/10 but theres one thing-. I use Spotify because its got all the music I like in comparison to the old app I used. Not naming any names  but there is one suggestion I would like to give. And that is- you now have the option to filter out your playlists and artists in your library, but there is no way to filter it to just YOUR personal playlists. By that I mean, you can filter to where its just playlists, but it includes the playlists you follow as well. I think it would be wonderful if you could add a filter called my playlists maybe, where it would not include the playlists you follow. Other than that, 10/10 music streaming service :)"
I use this almost everyday. Spotify is such a wonderful app and i enjoy using it so much. music is a big part of my life and this app is incredibly easy to use and understand. the customization and everything is incredible and this has to be one of my fav apps
"Needs some work. I really like Spotify but I wish so much that it was more like iTunes in that it keeps track of play count you can see, recently played lists, most streamed songs, etc"
Spotify ( my favourite musical app. I love using Spotify because I love to listen to my music offline to download with WiFi or with data on my phone
"Spotify Review. I enjoy the app as much as one can enjoy an add-riddled music app that selects/adds random music to your liked songs/PERSONAL playlist, not the daily mix. You guys give us 6 skips every day unless we send you money for premium features which i can understand, but then you guys start adding music weve never even listened to in our lives to our playlist saying playing suggested track then give us a limited amount of skips so were stuck listening to a song we never even added to the playlist. Think about it, maybe ill re download one day, most likely not"
How Dare You Track My Data. The Subject Line says it all
"There are pros & cons for this age 17+ app that feat. Pornography Album art. Cons:This app is not for teens or children. The app recommends pornography album covers no matter what you could be listening to. Advertisements can contain countless Trojan man commercials back to back as well as f words IN the advertisements with ladies in thongs twerking or sexual content. Parents beware. Also you cant block followers and your privacy settings are limited. Followers can see what you listen to even with all privacy settings. So this app is not for those who are trying to avoid pedophiles, sex offenders and stalkers. Once again parents beware.Limited security settings there is no two factor authentication for accounts.Pros:It is the best music service for free. Most variety and customization without parental controls.There is a kids app you can try instead called Spotify kids but it requires premium family account for 15 bucks a month.Apple Watch support Works like a remote control its not a stand alone watch app. Its a great feature and voice feature with Apple Watch too"
Keeps deleting my downloads. It keeps deleting my downloads like every two weeks. They must have a deal with Comcast to ensure I go over my monthly data cap
AMAZING BUT UNDOWNLOADS. So I have had premium for a while but just recently my downloaded playlists that I use when I have no data or anything UNDOWNLOADS and this is so god damn annoying. Like Im paying for this and Im sick of logging out and then logging in again this is obviously a Spotify issue so please fix this
"Data collection. The app is great, only issue is why do they need things such as my location and search history? Seems rather sketchy"
Spotify track list. I love the app ima keep it short and simple when Im listening to my playlist or especially my liked songs I hate when it plays a suggest track and I use all my skips trying to get back to my regular playlist. Please take this away I want to listen to my playlist not a suggest track please I love the app but your ruining it because of this
"Could be better. Its very annoying how I download things, or at least I think I did only to find out that all of it got deleted and has to be redownloaded constantly. Particularly annoying when traveling around and the WiFi is bad, which is why I pay to have the ability to download things in the first place. Unless you keep an eye on the app and make sure stuff redownloads all the time you may find yourself without music. I also hate how its streaming so often when its not necessary because it uses a lot of data. I have to constantly keep it turned off in settings so the app can only use WiFi or else all my data will be gone in a heartbeat thanks to this wonky app"
"Id rather just use SoundCloud. I cant choose the song I want, I cant skip any song I dont wanna hear and I cant use cellular data without having to pay"
"Loved the app UNTIL. Ive been using Spotify premium for YEARS now and I absolutely love it However, recently my songs will only play for a few seconds and then stop. My membership is paid, my wifi is connected and my playlists are downloaded for when Im using my data. Ive tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the app and signing in and out but nothing works"
Its a good app. Its free. Its free. I listen to music with data when Im out so all I have to pay is for data but I have it anyway so I like it
"Get hacked Constantly. Their security and privacy systems are so out of wack, the best part is getting hacked and having to clean up the mess that the perpetrator left because things can only be solved on users end what a joke. I spent 45 minutes deleting Music off a queue one by one that a perpetrator has created"
"Im not buying premium. so stop advertising it. Just because I get 2 minutes of ads every other song doesnt mean Im going to give money to you guys. Ill spend my money on a company that actually makes me happy and doesnt have me searching around for better, free music streaming services. Also, let me listen to the music I put in my playlist and dont interfere with this whole suggested track. If I wanted to listen to a random playlist Id use pandora"
"Annoying downloaded library optimization. I run around a lake where I dont get cell service. I explicitly told the app multiple times to keep certain albums downloaded to my device so I could listen to them while running and not receiving cell data service. However, every time I did this, about a week later Spotify would  optimize my on device library and I would end up running in silence. Terrible experience. Apple Music is much better"
"App. This app is so good It lets me play all of my favorite songs, and its so easy to make personal playlists. I just dont like how it adds songs onto your playlist without your permission, I hope they remove this feature"
New UI updates make it much less user friendly. Until a couple months ago I loved Spotify but the new interface is so confusing and bad to use. The personal library now has massive icons and weird sorting that mean I can never find playlists I want The main page used to suggest music based on time of day etc now its just a jumble Undo all these annoying changes please theyve made the app so much worse
"Downloads. Every time I download an album or a playlist, when I wanna listen to it again using my cellular data I have to download it again, is a cycle to make us spend more data, scam"
Spotify:. Spotify is a exceptional music app. The music is good quality. It needs lots of data to run if you are not running premium. Ad breaks can be repetitive and become slightly annoying. You only have 6 skips an hour which is not enough for me.   But overall my personal opinion to Spotify is it is a very good app for music. 
Would love it if the app would open. Spotify has been the way Ive listened to pretty much all of the music I listen to for a long time and it does have some incredible features but today for some reason the app refuses to open. Paying for premium becomes pointless if I cant access the app
"take my advice. have premium, i highly recommend u use spotify for all ur best songs, u wont regret it. its good to listen to all ur music offline, without using any data if, of course u have ur songs download ((;"
"Too hard to delete unwanted tracks. Too hard to delete unwanted tracks, including ones on Spotify playlists. Very annoying Very much need simple thumbs up and down like Pandora has had for YEARS"
"Bring back djay integration. Third party integration is the future of DJing, theres no denying that. I will happily pay another 9.99 a month for that feature, and many up and coming DJs will agree with me. PLEASE reconsider this. Much of what I spin is low-key Japanese indie stuff that is not on Tidal, Soundcloud, or anything else, and I cant afford the privilege of paying for these individual tracks. Sometimes, I dont even have the option. Keep in mind that Spotify will be hacked for our benefit anyways. Youre better off just charging us a 10usd"
By far the worst music streaming app. So garbage wont let me listen to my downloaded music with no data and I have premium :/:/
"Stops and skips - premium. Keeps skipping tracks, on albums and playlists and then when it does play it runs for a few seconds and turns off. Paying premium for what Used it for years and loved it - but this is awful. Rollback your update Spotify. This is awful UX"
"Stuff they should fix. When the app is free, please stop adding music to peoples playlists. I dont want to see ANYONES music archives forcefully flooded with recommended tracks just because they cant pay for the premium version. Plus, it jacks up anyone who misses a payment for whatever reason, as they suffer the same excruciating inconvenience. We like listening to familiar tunes. Bottom line, recommending music is fine, but shoving it into peoples personal playlists just because they arent paying for premium is petty. Please fix this, cause I know theres someone out there who can relate"
"I only pay for 2 apps. Spotify and Glo are the only apps worth paying for. I dont know what I would do without Spotify. I love all of the playlists that get curated based off my likes, listens and follows I find so much new incredible music and the interface is easy to use. Thank you so much Spotify for everything you do and providing me sanity. For your wellness, yoga, meditation and fitness needs, get Glo"
"Issues with the privacy of playlists. Great app but I wish there was an option to remove the random people that add your playlists, from the playlist. I have mine public and collaborative so my s/o can add things to it and listen to it. But its weird when random accounts follow the playlist and add things to it. As well as people I no longer talk and have blocked in the app can still have the playlist and access to it"
"This app is amazing, but. I love this app. I used to use it every time I work and I didnt  mind the shuffle. But now when I listen to my playlists it plays suggested tracks and random songs. If you could maybe make it so I could stop these it would be nice. Until then I dont think I will used Spotify"
A person. I love this app but it would be nice if we could save the songs so we can hear them with no data or wifi other wise Im switching to Apple Music
"Double dipping. I used to love Spotify and was a premium user for many years - thanks to apples update I now realise that this company has been double dipping - it used to be if you dont pay for the product, you are the product(YouTube for example) now it turns out Spotify werent happy with my £120 a year and also wanted to sell my data - and even go as far as patenting technologies to listen to my voice to gage mood to better recommend music. GET A GRIP. Stop tracking and just provide a seamless music service and I will return- double dipping mofos"
"irritated. You need a report an issue option on the app. I cant listen to even 30 seconds of music without the whole app crashing. Ive updated it, that didnt fix it, I tried using wifi, that didnt work, my cellular data, nothing. Im so sick of this. Not to mention the ads are getting rediculous. I wont be tricked into buying spotify premium like this. Messing with the quality of your app wont persuade people to buy premium, its only making me not give you money"
Spotify. I dont know if its just me or what but I play my favorite songs right then the appPlays songs that I did not like and of course I cant skip so I try tap my favorites again and I doesnt go back to my favorites it just plays songs that I did not Like and its annoying. Also the app stopsplaying music in the middle of a song then I go back to the app and itsstarts the song all over I thought it was my Wi-Fi or My data but I was reading the other reviews and it does the same them to them. The only this I like about the app is its free and it has all the songs I look up
"love spotify but. sometimes after downloading music, i try to play said downloaded music and it loads then notifys me that there is no internet, try again i then have to turn my data on in order for the music to work. not okay "
Best music app Ive found but. The privacy needs work. I have went three accounts like crazy cause some low life with no life keeps stealing my accounts. Pretty sad that some life forms cant think for themselves and make there own playlists.its not hard on this app cause there is pretty much every band and or song you are looking for at your fingertips. Or maybe the 10 a month seems like outta somepoeples budgets lol. Cut down 1 smoke a day and at the end of the month u would be able to cover 2 months of something way more enjoyable. Or go back to kindergarten to learn how to push buttons. Great app tighten up security and it would be a no brainer. To bad these lowlife dopers cant make there own music playlist but have the ability to hack someones account that enjoy my music and am getting sick of losing all my good playlists. Thanks for the music I listen to everyday.it part of my everyday life just hope u can get rid of the bottom feeders stealing others creations
Annoying. Consistently deleting downloads and not playing songs forcing me to delete and re download the app. Deletes downloads so I use more data

"Terrible and getting worse. This app is trash. The user interface is cluttered and clumsy. The connection is bad. Podcasts skip like theyre a scratched cd. They force you to use data for video podcasts instead of giving an audio only option. If they hadnt bought the rights to so many podcasts I wouldnt have it downloaded. F*** you, Spotify"
App is a data guzzler for no reason. This app is terrible. I download podcasts to listen to offline. The app never remembers its place when a podcast is paused and the app is closed. It cannot find or recall episodes saved to my device (iPhone 12 pro max) whats the point of downloading episodes of you have to turn on cellular data to recall what is downloaded. And lets say you have data turned on but play a downloaded episode it will not play from memory but instead stream the episode over cellular data. Go ahead play a Joe Rohan experience and watch this app use 5 or more gigs of data in 3 hours so that you wipe out your monthly allotment and have to pay overage fees. If I could rate with negative stars I would
The BEST Music App. I have discovered so many great artists that I otherwise would have had no clue existed if not for Spotifys personal mixes
"Reasoning for my 3 star review. Im addicted to music so Im always on Spotify, however I wish it offered more songs. And didnt have some ads and that I didnt have to use data sometimes considering that I have premium that shouldnt be happening especially for its price. I definitely would recommend Spotify to anyone who didnt have"
Premium. I wish I was free to use the app offline without having to use a free trial or pay for premium. I love listening to music with my ear buds in while Im riding on the bus or subway. Now I cant unless I use my data which could be used for I hate to say this more important things than music. Advertisements every six (?) songs is killing meeeeeee.Only being able to skip six times? I cant even find the song I searched up with those six skips.Thats my take on it. Please make it offline 
"Downloaded music wont play. I have spotify premium, and recently only one of downloaded songs will play without service or wifi. Everything else needs some sort of data to load in even if i have it downloaded. I thought with the recent update itd fix it but it didnt, so i want to know why im paying to download songs that still need internet to play"
Leave me alone. You are getting weird if this company and Facebook the parent company was people I would file restraining orders for stalking You might think this is funny but more people than not have decided you are kind of creepy I just want to listen to music I dont want to Dance in restricted zones or say anything to get me thrown in jail The future you are offering make me happy I have bone cancer that is how sad things are becoming I choose cancer over what you offer Now data mine that I guess go in bathroom on break squeeze one off and have a good day
"Why did I come back to Spotify?. Years ago, Spotifys library page used to have the best layout and features of any music app. Now it is a disgraceful shadow of its former glory. Why does it go to the artists profile when I click on them instead of showing me all the tracks I have saved from that specific artist? Why is it so hard to find tracks that I listened to recently but didnt happen to save? Why does it all feel so inconsistent?"
"Premium is a scam. While it does remove commercials and random music being added, the offline music part is complete bull, and sometimes cant even play with full bars of cellular data"
Privacy issues. It should have a two factor authenticator. It should have more protection for the password
Why I hate this app. This app does not have all the music and there is to much ads and mostly it uses all my data
Awesome. Using Spotify for 2 years now great app lots of music and the fact you can download tunes on wifi and not use data I use it at work all day every day
"Updates. Had enough of the app updating every 3 days, its using my data and I cant contact anyone about it. Pissing me off"
Good (plz read my review Im desperately waiting for reply). Ok dont get me wrong I love this appI can save my screen time (I have 3 hours) by turning my phone offI have a sorta channel in there and it has great songs and some I have never heard ofBut what really bugs me is that some COMMON ones are not on therePersonally thats only happened once to me but some of my friends have had it happen several timesThis is why Im only rating it 4 stars Also when I do the thing to save data it glitches out. Though it doesnt use to much in the first place sooo...I hope you read my review and take on mind what I saidLover of Spotify Xxx
No respect for privacy. Cant remove followers despite it being a request from users for years
"Still consumes data even though podcasts are downloaded. So I see that joe Rogan is on Spotify. I download his new podcast through WiFi, got the green tick by it in downloads and seems good to go like all podcasts before Start listening to it at work (off the WiFi) and it used all my phones data streaming the video while I listened The app was running in the background and it still ate over 3 gigabits of my data until I had none left My phone was locked yet still it runs in the background downloading and eating all my Data.  Whats the point in downloading a podcast if i cant listen to it without streaming the video. Im not watching anything thats 5 hours longFIX THIS OVERSIGHT"
"New update is trash. 10+ year paid subscriber here. With that being said Im about to delete this app and cancel my subscription to find something better. Why give people the ability to download podcasts and songs, but then make it impossible to access them without a GOOD (my 1 bar of 4G lte doesnt cut it) data connection? This is frustrating Beyond belief, as I rely on having music and podcast to get through my day. If this isnt resolved soon you will be losing a loyal customer"
I cant even get on the app. For some reason when I got the new update Spotify wont even let me get in the app with my WiFi or even if I am using data yes its a wonderful app but until this doesnt get fixed I will be unsatisfied with this app and I even tried turning off my phone and deleting the app and now I cant even log back in :/
Sad really. I used to have Spotify on my ps4 and phone now I cant skip songs unless I pay and all my songs start around the middle of the track I cant enjoy any of my music smh thanks Spotify for ruining music
"DO NOT UPDATE. Spotify just simply refuses to work on any older IOS so if you dont have IOS 14 do not download this app. Lost access to my playlist Ive been making for 3 years because of this. What a joke, cant even open the app???"
"No Apple Watch streaming. Spotify is incredible. In my eyes the best music streaming service around by a country mile.......which is why I find it inexplicable that with all the resources and I.T. Technicians you have at your disposal, you would alienate your loyal customers, by failing to support the market leading smart watch. Please, please, purrr-leasesee resolve this, so that customers like me arent forced away to lesser third party platforms, that do choose to support Apple Watch. (Im fully aware that you dont want to pay Apple again, just for the ability to stream on their watch - but everyone has to play to Google / Amazons / Apples tune, when wanting access to their different ecosystems)"
"Constant Glitches. For a large publicly traded company this has to be one of the worst apps Ive ever seen. It has constant glitches where itll lose your place in a podcast if you close and reopen the app or if it disconnects and reconnects to data. Visually its ehh. Overall annoying and underwhelming. They have a few podcasts that I like so for now Ill deal with this mess of an app, but please get your shot together Spotify and create an app that doesnt operate and look like it was a high school class project"
Spotified. All i would say is that is a must for anyone who enjoys music.Such diversity this app is truly incredible and i cant think of not having it
downloading songs. PUT BACK THE BUTTON TO LET US DOWNLOAD PLAYLISTS TO LISTEN OFFLINE. NOT EVERYONE HAS DATA
"Downloads are useless. I live in the mountains. I dont have signal when I leave my house. Due to this I download playlists of music and podcasts that I can listen to at work. Now for some reason Spotify requires you to connect before a downloaded podcast will play. Well guess what, I CAN NEVER CONNECT BECAUSE I DONT HAVE  S E R V I C E. Believe it or not I download things so I can listen to them without a connection. The only way I can remedy this is by switching to airplane mode and then, like magic, my podcast will play immediately. In fact, Im sure the reason its set up like this is so this company can always collect data to sell. Another problem is Spotify logging me out, but when I restart the app Im logged back in, but now every one of my music playlists are deleted and I no longer have music to listen to. How about we fix this? -sincerely, a paying Spotify customer of many year(who is now looking at Apple Music instead)"
"Too Many Ads. For a company that is publicly traded, has a pay service, uses your data, and pays the artist very little royalties, they sure do have an awful song to commercial ratio. Maybe its better if you use the pay service, but what Ive experienced for free makes me very reluctant to commit. If you want a free streaming service for like work and stuff, I would recommend Pandora. But also, just curate your own music collection. Its much more satisfying"
COVID 19 info. We are not stupid. We do not need Covid warnings. I dont need Spotifys help finding information on Covid 19. Stop trying to please the woke mob
"Adoration & Appreciation of the Upliftment of Hearts. Spotify is life-changing. It is a wonder to finally have access to the music that one before could have only dreamed of. To be able to immerse in the sounds of the beautiful & benevolent human spirit, and to be able to share it with loved ones is an incredible joy. Was rather dismayed when it was found that the some incredibly talented & empowering artists are not paid as they deserve. Spotify needs to honor these beautiful souls who give the world so much by sharing their genius to uplift & inspire humankind. They deserve it & even if it means we members pay more, so be it: Let us make it right"
"Forced to get Premium. The Spotify app for iOS refused to play what I tapped on. It kept playing other tracks so I thought the app was glitchy. Uninstalled then reinstalled the app, changed settings to turn off autobplay and recommendations, soft reset the phone... nothing worked. Until I subscribed for Premium. Now everything works perfectly. Basically, Spotify forced me to have to upgrade my plan. Thats a lousy move"
Stop spying on me. Stop spying on me China
Spotify premium. Great Spotify premium is amazing. Every song I need and lets me download music so I dont use my data Highly recommend Spotify premium
Really good. Spotify lets me listen to every song I like and that is why I love Spotify just that you need internet to or just have ur phone on low data mode
Not what I expected. I installed this to listen to my own music without using my mobile data and in my actually playlists majority of the songs I put in dont even end up as the song I play. It is much easier to search up the song on YouTube and I will still get less adverts
Number of ads is ridiculous Im so sad 8tracks is gone. Spotify is significantly inferior to 8tracks and so I refuse to pay more for a lower quality product
"Its ok. It will keep stopping my music randomly, and will add songs I didnt ask for to my playlist. They wont let me listen to my liked songs, they take me to a suggested radio track instead"
Offline uses. I should at least be able to listen to my whole play list offline cause I dont I still use my data but like what if I dont want to
"Getting tired. Starting to get really tired with spotify and the need to re-download all my bloody songs after an update. It puts me in a really good mood when I go to play my songs and I either have to spend an eternity downloading everything again, or use my data to listen to my music. The old platform I used to use before spotify, not once did I ever have to do that. Not once in years. With spotify, it seems like every update, I have to re-download everything. You guys are really starting to piss me off"
"Love Spotify, but the app takes too much data. I can watch music videos on YouTube no problem, but Spotify is slow sometimes if I dont have great service. Doesnt make sense to me how I can download a video of the song faster than the audio. I love Spotify, I often cant use it seamlessly even with decent service"
"Its very bad. When you dont have premium, theirs a add every 2 or 1 song. When you have it playing for a period of time, the app closes out automatically. Takes a long time to play music if you are using data with no premium"
"If you dont have premium, youre kind of screwed. The non premium version of the app is the worst thing you can have on your phone. You cant play certain songs, you cant play albums, and you cant even have a run of songs without a add coming in between each track"
"Absolute garbage. Downloaded this as my wife has started to make products with Spotify and youtube links to favourite songs embedded. O my god what a load of rubbish, you have to go to a completely different site to obtain a barcode then when you scan it the stupid thing plays random unrelated songs I've never even heard of (or wanted to) I'm assuming they get paid per play by the artist or something.Its such a rubbish looking, cluttered front end its hard to understand how they have got to this point. Probably unconcerned with how usable or unusable it is and just concerned with data grabbing for sale. Deleted and wont be re-downloading as will stick with youtube as their links work like clockwork every time"
"Progressively worse. I havent used Apple Music so unfortunately I cant compare but as an 8 year user of Spotify and a huge music fan, I have become progressively more and more disappointed with the company. Seems theyre much more occupied with collecting data and turning their music platform into a social media network. Over the past year and a half, my albums (over 100) have started undownloading randomly, I use to be able to play off one device (my laptop) and control the music off another (my phone) but the function has become so glitchy I dont even bother anymore, in general the music often starts stuttering and is only fixed by closing the app, and the app stores so much data on you that you regularly have to delete it and redownlod the app and all your music to clear the gigabits it stores up in its caches. All in all, as a music lover I would encourage others to try SoundCloud or Apple Music first. Only reason I havent switched is because the hassle involved in transferring playlists and such"
"I love it. I love sound cloud so much i use it daily and i love how it doesn&#39;t use data, way ahead of amazon music apple music and spotify"
Your better than YouTube. We have limited data and you dont use much data this is way better than YouTube because you dont have advertisements and Spotify is the best. You are way way way way way way way better than YouTube. From BEZZA
Complete scam I need a refund. I paid for it and was ok for a week then albums went missing and all my songs changed to a 5 second preview version and instead I get random songs that Ive never added This is kinda advertising for other singers I dont care about. My money is gone Spotify used all my data and I cant listen to my songs
"Music keeps stopping. Ive been using Spotify for years, my phone doesnt do this to any other music platform. The songs continually pause a second into it, no matter of every other app is closed or Im using data for the app"
"Updates Are Ridiculous. I am a premium member. I use to love Spotify. Not anymore I dont have unlimited data, so I loved being able to download podcast episodes at home before my commute. To me, downloaded means downloaded, no data needed. It now takes 10 minutes or so for my downloaded episodes to load once I get on the road, and it wont load if my cellular data is off.  Dont call it a download if its not actually downloaded. And this new library format is stupid Not happy at all"
"Continuous playback is annoying and wasteful. I pay for Spotify Premium because I don&#39;t like listening to a bunch of random music or being unable to listen to an album in the correct order. So I really don&#39;t appreciate when I get to the end of an album and a bunch of random stuff starts plying after, and as of the last time I checked I can no longer opt out of this. It wastes my data and phone battery, and it honestly ruins the mood a lot of the time. If I wanted to listen to the radio, I would have picked... a radio station"
Feedback. I wish that you didnt have to have Spotify premium to be able to have unlimited skips. But other than that I am really liking Spotify and love it so much
Loading issues. Spotify is very slow to open and play my music. I already have it downloaded so I dont need data to listen. Its frustrating
Ruinous updates. Ive lived Spotify and use it hours per day listening to podcasts but am shopping around now after the last update.  The library changed in a way that prevents me from listening to my download list like it used to and now theres a useless episodes tab that just adds every podcast I download even after I delete it...I dont want that and cant make it stop.  Cant get my list of just my downloaded podcasts back either and there is no contact info on the app.  Your welcome for my money I guess but how dare you take it without having contact info on your app.  Are you a company or the mob?   Im only writing this because of how disappointed I am.  This app was great 6 months ago.  Now its an inconvenient mess
Podcast eating up data. How hard is it to provide an option to disable videos on podcasts at least while streaming on data?
"Became trash. It was grate until it stopped playing downloaded songs offline. I need music when I travel and I dont get I signals while on the road. The app wont work offline at all which defeats the purpose of getting the premium. The whole reason why I got this app was to save Data, FIX IT"
Non stop party. Spotify is my go to for music. It fuels life for real. They make it simple and easy to take your favorite tracks anywhere. User for life
Best song app. About 2 years ago when I was at least 11 (Im now 13) I didnt really know how to use Spotify. Last year I reloaded it onto my phone and now is one of the #1 apps I use because I love it so much. I definitely recommend
App is not working. Ive always used Spotify but recently my downloaded music wont play unless I have wifi or turn on my data
"this app does not have standard privacy parameters. I would like to permanently enable private session. It toggles off sporadically. Its just an overshare of information. I would like the ability to BLOCK certain followers or accounts. There are folks out there who sleuth, stalk, and peer into what you choose to listen to in your free time. Read reviews of your product. Users want these features"
Great app. Spotify if the best music app Ive ever used you can subscribe but honestly theres not a reason to expect youll have to watch a little video and I need data to listen with no WiFi other than that its a really good app you can even search songs
Easy Listening on Spotify. I recently purchased the  Spotify Premium family  . Absolutely happy with the features and offers of privacy and controls for the younger children. Makes listening to my favourite music a pleasure especially when Im marking and grading my students work or cooking . I love the skip button when Im out on my run and that it links to my Nike run app. Highly intoxicating(in a positive  way )and would recommend Spotify premium
ADD BLOCK FEATURE. app is great but it really needs a block feature. just so i can keep a sense of privacy especially since i have someone whos been stalking me
"Proceed with caution. Its ok in terms of hearing songs you want, but if you use the free version its annoying.  You may get to hear 3-4 songs then you get to hear loonng lengthy ads.  If you try to use a trial period carefully cause even after you cancel that subscription before your trialIs over they will keep your info & still charge you.  If you go to the website to try & talk with support you get whole oh connection is bad please try again so much that you reach the point of saying eff it take the $10.81 you sneaky effs.  Subscription & app are deleted & out of my lifewhen CS gives me the run around Im out"
"Easily hacked. Really liked Spotify until my account was hacked like 15 times. I got sick and tired of changing my password 15 times. I had to change my email password, iCloud password, etc. and Spotify was always hacked. Theres an issue going on at Spotify and its not worth paying for if your personal information and account is being hacked"
"great but buggy. love everything about spotify apart from the fact i cant listen to more than 10 seconds of any song regardless of whether its downloaded or not. i pay £10 a month just for all my songs to be unplayable for no reason. ive tried reinstalling, using data, using wifi and using downloads but every time i press play on a song it plays for 8-14 seconds then stops and i cant click on it again"
"I would like to know if you need me to contact you for tracking information. Always plays music I like to listen to drown out the noise around me. Knows just want I need to hear when I need to hear, y to see u"
"Amerikas medicine to soul. I come In peace to you Spotify, my name is Amerika . I love how Spotify allows me to create my own playlists. Sharing what I listen to on IG is essential since its how I connect with people. I just wish it played the song as I shared it on my IG story instead of just the image of artist &amp; info of song . Music is necessary self love maintenance to my soul . Thank you for providing an outlet to fire it up  I literally listen to my Spotify music on a daily as I drive for Uber lyft and for my personal driving . Much love "
good song selection. im able to find certain albums that arent on pandora. i just wish i had the option to remove a track when i get tired of it. i know theres an option on the desktop version just not on the phone. it would be nice to be able to block certain songs/artists from playing. 3 out of my 5 top played songs were songs spotify kept playing itself and i dont even like those songs
"Apple Watch. Uhhh, guys.... you are flagrantly lackluster on the Apple Watch. The complications show zero information (current track?), and/or are ugly (infograph inner circles - shrink the icon). But seriously, none of that matters compared to the fact that you cant stream music without your phone. Boo Dont make me use Apple Music its sooo bad"
"Space Garbage Spanish? Not mine. 4/2021: Still two stars, still a great tasting feces sandwich Still playing random music in a huge playlist and now the ads are being pushed like every two tracks. Still building my personal music and got over 200gb, most not recognizable by Spotify. The artists are coming in tho, thats all thats good.  Stop the random Spanish ads cuz thats just ignorant. Still two stars tho, been years and come back here and there. Never paid version of any app - its music. Released to the public Most artists arent worth paying for the whole album anymore. 2018: I have a large capacity phone, it&#39;s a 5-star app, I can find almost all my music that I&#39;ve search for so far with some exceptions, BUT needs almost a gig of space? I sign in, need to build my selection still, have  limited skips or change playlist - it&#39;s fully open on Google devices and iPads, even rewind.11/20/2017:The app works as expected other than playing a random track rather than something remotely related. When listening to DMX one does not expect to listen to Pillar (some new kind of rock). Still takes a lot of room for info not on my phone, cant find every song since based off the artists I guess, sometimes the commercials are random. Usually after the first song whEn starting a workout. "
"PANDORA PLEASE READ. They seriously need to stop adding songs to YOUR personal playlists. Its not their playlists, its yours. Thats the reason I deleted it and switched to Pandora. Pandora is way better, I recommend it. You only have to listen to 1 add a day then you can play 200000 songs of your choice and you can restart the song or go backwards if your using a playlist. And better yet, they dont add songs to your playlist"
Ultimate platform. This streaming app is very good and I like Spotify connect but the app takes too much data space on my iPad 
Data needed. You should be able to play music without WiFi or Data
"amazing. I listen to spotify everywhere, on the bus, in the house and in the shops its gr8 cus i dont burn my data or batterybe better if u didnt have to pay for premium"
Awesome 5 stars. Couldnt ask for a better app than Spotify. Tons of music to chose from and playlists galore. I recommend you buy a subscription and make your own playlists; you will have music that plays even if youre out of wifi or in a low/no data area. Plays beautifully on your vehicle audio - like being at the concert itself - audio quality is 100%. No buffering issues. Also faster access to new releases including music from tiktok. Join up and live the experience
"Seriously. I only had the app for 12 hours and I just now deleted it. 1, the ads. Come on. I dont care if you want to show ads but they are way too repetitive and way too long. 2, I looked up one song I wanted to listen to, clicked it and it played something entirely different. Stop playing suggested tracks and let me listen to my music goddamn it. 3, I want to be able to organize my playlist, skip songs etc"
"No email, no music threats. Not at all happy with the message I got saying that I wouldnt be allowed to continue using the app if I didnt confirm my email. Yes, I get the whole thing about privacy and hacking and all that, but dont appreciate being threatened and having to stop and confirm my email to continue listening to music. Im paying you. Be nice. Hope that doesnt happen again"
"Terrible. My account got hacked and all of my songs were gone and replaced with the hackers songs, thats right he was using my account. Dont recommend unless you want your private information leaked"
"The personal recommendation algorithm is terrible. No matter how much input you provided, how many songs you have marked as dislikes or likes. The recommendation just sticks with what it is. It is so unbelievably dumb. The UI is not intuitive either. For example, not consistent among similar views. Sometimes you can find shuffle sometimes you cannot. Same for button like dislikes"
"Account Hacked, Cant Delete the History. Ive used Spotify for a few years and had premium for a good chunk of that time. My account was hacked recently and whoever it was listened to a bunch of spammy fake-looking playlists that I cant delete from my recently played, which messes up my recommendations.Especially if Im paying for a premium account I should be able to tailor my listening experience, including deleting songs from my recently played. Now Im stuck with random junk on my listening history"
Enjoying my subscription. Really pleased with Spotify. A few years ago I sold my vinyl and cd collections a new home with little storage was the cause.I never let on that I missed my tunes that I had amassed over 40 years.Spotify has allowed me to play the old tracks l shouldnt have let go. The search range is amazing and l have explored into international music and classical worlds. The subscription to Spotify is priceless
"Misinformation. To choose someone who deliberately misinforms the American public against science based information that could stop this pandemic in its tracks, is nothing short of irresponsible. No one is saying he cant have his opinion, but thats all it is. There are no facts to back it up. Why does it always come down to money? Why couldnt you do the right thing and advertise that youre taking the interest of the American public to heart? It could actually work for you"
"Spotify. I have had Spotify for years now and I still love it, highly recommend to friends only thing I wish was to not play the suggested track as much"
The offline. I want to play my song outside of my house and its says offline and Im using data and I dont know what is going on
Great but. Ive been using Spotify for almost two years now and I love the app. It has all the music I look for when I want it. My only problem is recently when Ive been listening to music while on another app the music pauses and closes the app. I thought it was an update so I check and updated the app but a few hours later it started doing it again. Its really annoying to stop what Im doing to reopen the app and reshuffle my playlist. Another thing that I hate is suggested tracks. I go through all the songs on my playlist instead of going to the radio based on my playlist  where I can reshuffle it plays suggested tracks that arent related to my playlist and music taste and I cant reshuffle it so I have to find a new playlist
Meh. Used to swear by Spotify but lately its horrible. Nothing is loading (says Im not connected to wifi or not using data (which I am using).) Also I cant even play downloaded song because nothing is loading. Im seriously thinking about canceling my subscription
100% better then Apple Music. This app actually works. Also when you download to your phone it doesnt continue to stream off your Data like Apple Music. If you cant tell I hate Apple Music. You guys are hands down the better provider
"Great app but. I love listening to music, especially on Spotify. After the last few app updates, Ive had to re download songs and whole playlists. I got tired of the app using up my data so i turned off the internet option in my cellular settings. I hope they fix it soon"
Great app but needs changes. On phone it doesnt let you access your songs I know this isnt major but it is really annoying. Other than that great app
"Downloaded just for JRE. Got the app for JRE and found that not only does the podcast stream but so does the video in the background, sucking up all my data. You can download, but only if you pay for premium. Then to add insult to injury, Spotify removed his controversial episodes. They wont be getting my money"
"WONDERFUL WAY TO LISTEN TO YOUR FAVOURITE MUSIC. Spotify ticks all the boxes when it comes to listening to your favourite songs and genres of music....millions of tracks at the speed of sound From a personal perspective, I would love to see a genre under  the Dance - Electonica section of Dance Remixes and a max of 20 seconds fade out/fade in on tracks, when putting playlists together. Otherwise, a brilliant bit of kit"
"Good content, terrible player. Why cant I sort my playlists?? Why cant I sort by newly added instead of scrolling forever to the bottom?? And why does Spotify insist on downloading the video if Im on cellular AND I forgot to download it previously AND selected dont download video under data saver? Where is the dont stream video option?? This is basic functionality people dont let Joe Rogan boss you around"
"Not happy with the app for the last couple months. My music will randomly stop, the app will crash, or the songs wont play at all. I pay a subscription for access to this app and the ability to download the songs so Im not using up my data when Im driving. Considering switching services if theres not a solution in the near future"
"I find spotify great, but I do have premium. ive never really known spotify without premium, but spotify with premium is amazing you can play songs even if you have no data (as you can download them) and it has no ads which is great I really recommend spotify"
"Great app and experience. I love Spotify. I really like the suggested tracks it throws up, in the various ways. Ive discovered music I now love this way. Info on gigs for artists useful too. App works excellently and reliably, including premium"
"First to worst. Apple Music is so much better, so glad we switched. Was good in 2009 now it plays the same tracks over and over. Spotify officially lost what made it great. My playlists now are only songs I liked previously. Continuing to fail, Ive canceled my family plan and were using Apple Music and loving it"
Pay artists. Pay artists. Stop stealing my data. Ads terrible
"Hacked. Hi, I hope this review finds someone who can help. There have been NUMEROUS times when my account has been hacked by freeloading idiots. For example, I could be listening to my playlist and all of a sudden, the music stops, and there are other people accessing my Spotify account using a created room Family Speaker. Ive checked every song last one of my Bluetooth devices to make sure it didnt link to one of them somehow, and the conclusion is still the same, some hackers are accessing my account Please, I dont pay for this application to be intruded on, so if there is a way to enhance security measures that will protect people like me, PLEASE DO IT Id hate to end my subscription to move on to the next competitor. Thank you for your time"
"If you want a music app THIS IS THE ONE TO DOWNLOAD. I love Spotify, Im always talking to my friends about what song Im listening too, and I love how you can make your own list of songs you like. Im a BTS lover and this app is easy to press play and blast BTS in my ears I listen to my list almost EVERY day, and ALWAYS enjoy it, every time I go somewhere for a couple days that doesnt have internet (because I dont have data) I get REALLY REALLY sad because I cant listen to music. Sorry Im getting side tracked. Anyways this app is absolutely amazing So if you need a good app to listen to music, this is the one."
"My thoughts. As much as I think that Spotify is a good app for listening to your favourite artists, I honestly think it would be better if we could navigate the album and choose tracks without it being stuck in shuffle. I hope this gets fixed and that way I dont have to go through the trouble of connecting another device"
"Would be nice if it could connect to the servers. This app is great, but only when Im connected to wifi because thats the only time its able to reach its servers. No wifi means Spotify is always offline, even when I have full bars of data and every other app on my phone works just fine. Ive troubleshooted this issue with every solution listed as an option and yet the app is always offline. The only option I have is to download music and play offline but you need a premium subscription for that, and Im not sure if its worth paying for an app that cant connect to its own servers half the time. The playlists are still better than Apple Music tho"
"FAVOURITE APP ON MY PHONE. Spotify is amazing. Yes its annoying getting all the ads without premium but thats how the world works these days ads are everywhere. Premium is well worth it in my opinion, especially with the family plan. Virtually every song you could ever imagine is here, I even found some songs my mom would sing me as a kid that I had forgotten about. Tons of podcasts that are amazing to fall asleep to as background sound. You can download songs and listen on the go without using up data. Best music app ever"
"Spotify. Brilliant great variety of music, looks really well when connected to Internet the only thing with the free account and not premium is that you cant listen to music off-line as youll have to use your data but overall no a brilliant app wouldnt really fault it and works well with strong connection lags a bit when theres only a small amount of connection but overall a very very good app"
"Its like they want money. It was great when (on WiFi) you could do anything like unlimited skips, only listen to the songs in your playlist and use it like YouTube with choosing songs. But now (on WiFi) you have 6 skips an hour have to listen to other songs which you cant skip. Of WiFi you cant even play songs so have to use data. Its great for laptops but not phone or iPad. Premium is like £120 a year and basically you have to get it for mobile if you dont want ads every song. Spotify used to be good but now its a money grab. Would not recommend it to anyone unless they are willing to pay £10 a month. Amazon or Apple Music is cheaper a month and Apple Music can be used for garage band and IMovie"
"Hacked. Received email from Spotify that I was hacked by someone in Russia, who began creating and playing playlists via my account. Had to change all personal passwords for Spotify, Amazon, Apple and Google"
Bad. After not premium support data load song is too bad maybe time for change apple music
"Not bad. I enjoy the premium service, but its currently crashing every time I try to open it. Ive also been hacked before because I left my personal hotspot on and someone used it to hack my Spotify while I was on the public bus... itd be nice if Spotify had at least one more step to verify youre the account holder when logging in, or so that you can change your password if the hacker changes it and takes your account. They wouldnt even be able to change the password if the extra verification step was good enough. That being said though,  I  did get my account back after a bunch of emails"
"What do I do now with my 100s of CDs and records. I have a vast collection of CDs and vinyl collected over 40+ years of music appreciation. Now that I have a Spotify account I can access millions of tracks from artists around the world and across the decades, not to mention all the new music and am now exposed to. Spotify has made my collection redundant, even though you still cant beat a cracking Bowie album on the turntable"
"Spotify. Fantastic app for old &amp; brand new work. The best. Love Spotify playing constantly,has never failed to find my track. Thank you very much"
"Spotify. Fantastic app for old &amp; brand new work. The best.Love Spotify playing constantly,has never failed to find my track. Thank you very much"
"KEEPS DELETING MY DOWNLOADS. Not sure if they have a partnership with ISPs, but the app keeps deleting the music I have downloaded every few months, forcing me to redownload everything periodically, which eats up my data allowance. Scummy"
"Suggested track. Spotify is a great app not gonna lie, and I like the way u can go to ur favorites and choose what type of music u can listen to(but I wish u could listen to a certain artist) One thing I hate is the suggested track. I hate how when ur whole playlist is rap and the suggest track plays these slow songs and heartbreak songs, and then I run out of skips( also we need more skips) and then i gotta go on a whole different playlist and its just two much. So in sum u should make the suggested track more like ur liked songs or just het rid of it in whole, and give us more skips"
"Great winds of change. After many years of downloading music using another medium, I was greatly annoyed at being charged a monthly fee as well as a charge for every song downloaded.  Hooray for Spotify I have subscribed to Premium and can download or listen to all the music, podcasts etc I wish without additional charges. After a slowish start, the range of music is now huge and personal recommendations are greatly appreciated"
"Spyware. Its a shame Im gonna have to loose my finely crafted playlists, or at least downgrade from premium after hearing about your recent patient to spy on your users. I cannot support your app when you do evil things like this"
"Has potential. I understand the advertisements, but I cant stand the double dipping with these recommended tracks. After a certain point, I don&#39;t get to choose what I listen to. Im forced to waste my skips, and Im not paying $10 to unlock a service that should already exist. What is the point of creating a playlist or choosing to listen to one if half the content is something I dont want? This isnt the way to make me interested in your product; locking what the app should be behind a paywall. Again I understand the ads, but I refuse to pay $10 a month to be able to skip recommended track. It annoys me, and its bullsh*t"
Idk. First of all I dont think its only me but sometimes my song will stop playing and the app has completely restarted. Second Im not really liking the recommended songs in my personal playlist. I only want to hear what I put in. Its ok to show them but I dont like that I have to use my skip for the recommended songs. Third its a little annoying with that watch this video to get 30 minutes of free listening because even if you choose not to watch it they end up giving you ads
"Playlist Photos + Ads. Spotify is extremely easy to use and I love listening to music while I go about my daily tasks. I use this app all the time, but theres some things that bug me. First, the Ads. I always watch the ad for 30 minutes without them, but lately, its been either not working and I cant watch the ad OR it plays but I still get ads five minutes later. Please fix this, its really frustrating. Second, this is just a nitpick but please put an option to change playlist photos on the mobile app. Third, the suggested tracks. God, I hate these. I just want to listen to the playlist I set up, not a bunch of random songs that dont even match the playlist. Its very annoying, especially since it wont let me play the actual playlist once the suggested tracks start.  Please get rid of this featureThank you for your time"
My Apple Watch and AirPod pro. I dont wanna have to switch over to Apple Music when are yall going to give the option to access Bluetooth devices such as AirPod pro its a personal preference amongst peoples of Spotify including myself to not have cellphones on our persons during exercise or keeping up with cardio you could potentially lose many customers please send out that update
Horrible for podcasts. It only works if youre playing something all the way. Whats the point of downloading a podcast if Spotify will keep using data to play the video version. Im in an area where I lose service sometimes and the app doesnt know what to do. Itll will freeze and not play until I have service again even though I downloaded the episode in advance on wifi
"Bug? Hacked?. Ok Ive been a premium user for several years and Ive always loved Spotify, but recently Ive been finding random songs that Ive never even heard of start popping up in my personal playlists. Anti Social Club and Ur Not Cool are two songs that keep appearing out of nowhere. Also, sometimes when Im listening to a playlist, my music will just start playing one of those songs and its irritating and a little creepy. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look into this, thank you. I would like to continue listening to my favorite music app in peace"
"Great Balls of Fire. I have been through vinyl, 8 track, cassettes, and CDs. With Spotify I now instantly have access to all the music I ever owned, and a whole lot more that I had wished for along the way. My favorite app ever "
"SHUFFLE BAD. Your biased algorithm is interfering with MY personal playlists of DOWNLOADED songs, on my PREMIUM account"
"Complaint. Get rid of adds, I dont care for the who the what the when and why. Dont advertise everything or anything because there are other ways to grab someones attention and Im sick of paying data thats just wasted on ads I dont want"
"Progressively worse. About a year ago there was an update that made it so to search your library for a specific artist you had to be following them like this is discount Twitter. Annoying but fine, Ill just follow my artists and then I can still search my library for a specific one and play them when I want. Now thats not even possible. Searching YOUR LIBRARY for an artists will show you that artists ENTIRE catalog, regardless of how many of those songs youve actually saved. Why even have an artists tab in your library if that tab takes you to music that isnt in your library? The artists tab takes you to the same place that a regular search takes you. If the goal was to streamline the app then you just made two routes to the same destination, while removing a vital feature.Now, if you turn off data and click on the artist youre given a downloaded songs option. Was it really too difficult to give this option when data is turned on as well? Why do I have to cripple my phone to make the app usable?"
The best app ever. Its has all the Music in the word and more.I was on a trip nothing to do and YouTube its up too much data Spotify doesnt.plz get this app
Great app but needs these updates. This app is great to listen to any song well not all songs but still it is awesome. The only problems with this app is that you cant delete your recently played history. The thing about this is that you dont know if a little kid might grab your phone and see what you been listening and they can tell an adult and that is going to someones personal space I wish you guys can fix that because it would be great. Basically that is the only problem that I have to be honest. I hope you guys take this in mind because it might be really useful
"The quintessential music app. Spotify. An app that everyone should have. Apple Music I hear you say, neigh I reply. For the simplicity and ease of use that comes with Spotify, it wins my vote and the vote of many others. Chief among its impressive capabilities, is its incredible ability to set an algorithm based on what Im listening too. Almost every track that it comes on during a shuffle session is a track I would consider  an absolute banger and it never ceases to amaze me. It also has a great selection of lesser known music/artists thats Ive had no problem finding. Simply, the perfect music streaming app. Anyone who disagrees is childish"
Great place to get info. Come here to get real objective information.  Other tech platforms are suppressing you and the suppression comes from young people who have an agenda
"Best music streaming service. It works off data from the music you listen to to give you what you want, with an easy to use interface, and millions of artists"
"Spotify is by far the best music app ever. In my opinion Spotify is the best music app Theres so many playlists, artists on there. I also like the fact that you can download playlists, songs, albums and play them when you dont have a wifi of data connection"
Very unclear. I cant seem to be able to listen to the playlist I created in the order I set it. Spotify also added tracks to it and wont let me skip to tracks I prefer. I had been reluctant to download the app since it is paying artists so ridiculously and I am so far not convinced
Missing features. This is the only app I have ever used that does not allow you to block and/or remove people from following you. This is a serious privacy issue. There is someone that I do not want following me that has a playlist with a picture of my face on it. Ive reported it and nothing has happened. I do not want this person following me. I want them blocked but this is not possible
"A huge flaw. It usually works great, apart from some minor UI annoyances.The huge problem with it is that it gives no options for video podcasts. You can download a video podcast, but it doesnt download the video, just the audio (and it doesnt tell you this). So without realizing it, you can get killed on data, or it suffers performance issues while playing.Theres also no option to turn off the video, even though Spotify is for audio. Why cant I just download the audio part? This makes video podcasts pointless unless youre on wifi. This needs to be fixed ASAP, but its been months and they havent done anything about such an obvious issue"
"Personal Favorite Music Mixs. Hello, I love the fact that with Spotify you can make as many music titles, categories, and favorite group collections. As a point of reference I am 59. As a kid being from Metro Detroit, my female cousins all listened Motown . My mom and step dad listened to Country. I listened to Rock in Rock. All types. Well I listen to everything nowadays. Back then you had to record your mix tapes on cassettes. We had 8 track tapes too. The music industry has made big money off of me. I had to buy my favorite albums on all the newest platforms. I wonder what will follow Spotify? And will Spotify be the company that pushes the next Platform. Steve Zarycki signing off"
"Fix the Facebook login. Despite not using Facebook to log in, Spotify constantly pings Facebooks graph API due to how the login API is implemented. This is a huge invasion of privacy and effectively allows Facebook to track the location / IP addresses of non-Facebook users"
What it needs. I like it better when the library was titled library instead of liked songs and why do you have a limit on how many songs can be downloaded? I frequently have no internet and I would like access to ALL of my music AND why dont you allow  uploading of music to a personal play list I have Some tracks that I would like to have on here that you dont offer
"Stop deleting our songs. Im really frustrated that I pay for the premium family plan in order to download music and play it offline but our songs (different songs on 2 different phones under our user IDs) keep getting deleted and we cant play them offline as intended Based on the community forum this has been going for years What are you doing to fix the problem? What support are you offering for this?? Would really like to continue to play my song offline and use the features I pay more money for If you cant fix it, will you at least pay for my data plan on my phone in return so that I can stream my songs?"
"Incredibly disappointed. Spotify was one of my favorite apps to listen to because with premium, I could listen to music in low data areas. But now,  the music that I have downloaded never loads and never plays. Even when Im in high data areas, it still doesnt load. I have cellular data on for this app, so this shouldnt be an issue, and a year ago, it wasnt. But as soon as its off the WiFi connection I cant play anything. At this point I might as well get SoundCloud. Even without paying anything at least it loads"
"Communist nut jobs. This is no longer about music.   This company has turned into a psychopathic control freak.   Time to go back to CDs and records so your not being tracked, traced and controlled.  It's time for big tech to die"
Love it BUT. I had this app for YEARS. No issue at all until I switched to my new phone and logged out of the app. I tried to enter my information and it wouldnt let me. I was highly upset especially when I tried to update my information
"It keeps on stopping. Whenever I dont have the app open, sometimes my music stops randomly and the app restarts. I have to open and close the app multiple times to get it to work again. It mighty just be a bug when you dont have enough internet, but its still a little annoying.Also, it always plays suggested tracks, and theyre so annoying If I wanted to listen to those songs i would put them in my playlist. Although it might help expose us to different music, its honestly annoying. If you dont have premium, then you only have SIX SKIPS PER HOUR. And then I waste it all on trying to get past the suggested tracks. Some people do like this feature, so I feel like the best way to solve this is to make a way to turn it off in settings.Overall, Spotify is a nice music platform, and I actually like my music in random order since i dont know what to expect. These are just a few things that bug me.TL;DR Music randomly stopping, suggested tracks"
please help. i like using Spotify but recently i cant even listen to one song without sone random song popping up and not letting me listen to the sing i would like to listen to. the stupid part is you cant turn it off. i tried everything. please tell me how to turn off the suggested track
"My Expanded Universe. My experience using Spotify has opened up a whole universe of musical discovery. Being able to view artists, their discographies and most listened tracks plus access to history notes from music journalists, as well as scouring playlists has introduced a myriad of new sounds and artists and expanded my range of musical appreciation beyond belief"
"Not good  Doesnt do what is promised. Ive had to cancel my phone contract in order to save money where due to recent circumstances of unemployment at the moment, this means I have no data and have to rely on WiFi. Spotify promises that you can listen to music offline which means you can listen to downloaded music no problem but this HAS not worked , so when Im out of range for WiFi I cant listen to my downloaded music? Why not ? Please can this be fixed, this used to work so why didnt it work now , when its probably needed the most by people all over the globe"
"Why cant mobile users delete data. Okay, I would like to remove some of my recently played or some podcast as I dont really enjoy as i only went to listen once and know the podcast is in your shows it kinda annoys me as i dont want anyone to know that i had listen to that podcast. I am aware that i can do this on pc although it doesnt to the same for mobile. I am a mobile user and cannot remove or block podcast or playlist and it would be easier than having to make a whole knew account which I will be doing, as I heard as this feature was removed for mobile users makes me a bit angry but i will not be fustrated"
"Unscrupulous. I havent had an active Spotify account in a decade. I recently got a new phone and for some reason all previous apps were reactivated. Noticed on my credit card statement that I was being charged the monthly fee again. Dont remember any of my account info because remember, I havent had an active account in a decade. Shady:("
Enjoy. I do love this app &amp; customizing my own personal song choices..however the ads can be irritating sometimes
This is great. Spotify is great. You can find so many artists and podcats. They have so much music and artists its so hard to keep track The random song artists are so common and related to what song you are listening to. I overall love Spotify. I like being able to play one specific song makes playlists and so much more. This is such a great app
Wont play downloaded music. The app wont play downloaded music anymore unless Im on wifi or data. Why am I paying for a premium family plan if I cant even play downloaded music? That was the whole point of premium
"Stop deleting our songs. Im really frustrated that I pay for the premium family plan in order to download music and play it offline but our songs (different songs on 2 different phones under our user IDs) keep getting deleted and we cant play them offline as intended Based on the community forum this has been going in for years What are you doing to fix the problem? What support are you offering for this?? Would really like to continue to play my song so offline and use the features I pay more money for If you cant fix it, will you at least pay for my data plan on my phone in return so that I can stream my songs?"
"Needs fixing. This app is great for listening to music and listening to new tracks but on the IOS version there seems to be a bug that keeps stopping my music without me closing the app. it is so incredibly annoying that it makes me give this great app a 2 star review. I would like to also add that the ads on this app are incredibly repetitive and annoying, every 2 songs Ill get 3 ads. There is also hardly any playlist customization on IOS although the PC version of spotify does allow you to customize your playlist (remove tracks, edit playlist picture etc). Please fix this. Thank you"
"Saved 60% of my 16GB iPhone space. Well, I have a 16GB 6S and I prefer 320KBps mp3 downloads. I was always on a full iphone and often couldnt take pictures.I listen to Rock, Jazz, Acoustics and HipHop mostly. After a VPN gave me access to Spotify I have removed 20 albums from my Music folder rendering my phone mostly empty.The automatic quality option works fine for me as data is pretty cheap in these parts of the world.UPDATE: Rocking an XS-Max with a 12 pre-order still with absolutely no music stored locally. Apple Music may take me off this soon, I dont need VPN and Target vouchers for that as it is available in my country"
Changes to personal library. I really dont like the update to the personal library. The way its laid out with all of the liked artists albums is now the same as when you search the band. It was way more user friendly when you could download single songs and have them show up on a list under that bands name. People leave out certain songs and albums for a reason
"Videos. Why cant I not have videos accompany the songs, its killing my data"
gr8 app BUT CAN WE PLS BLOCK ACCOUNTS. i luv this app like ty ty BUT can we PLEASE get a feature to BLOCK accounts ??? i would like that extra privacy bc ppl i used to know can still monitor my acc and try to communicate with me through this app  i get anxious knowing they can still observe me when i dont want them to. and yes ive privated everything. i would just rly appreciate the extra privacy
Needs improvment. 1. Maybe we can allow an unlimited song limit for a personal library?2.  Some artists I try to follow do not stay following.3.  I can no longer access my queue.  Other toggles work fine
"Great but theres an issue. Love the app but recently Ive been having an issue where my downloaded songs wont play offline without using cellular data. Or if they do, its only some of them. This didnt happen until the spotify session feature was added. I used it once and ever since then Ive had to uninstall and re install the app multiple times"
"Thankful. Coming from Amazon and Apple Music, Spotify has been so much more personal and easy to use. I am exceedingly thankful"
"Something went wrong. So i signed up for spotify on my ipad but it wont let me log in on my phone, it keeps saying something went wrong. Ive even tried making a new account with a different email and it still says something went wrong. I tried deleting the app and getting it again,  ive tried switching wifi to data and ive tried turning my phone off and back on but this app still wont log me in. Please fix this"
"better than apples options. Wish itunes hadnt bit the dust (interface is unusable) and we actually got to own our own music collections still, but the Spotify app gets the job done, though they compensate artists very poorly. Sometimes the app randomly will erase everything ive downloaded for offline playing, so i have to manually pick and download it all again, but i guess that keeps things fresh. Just is unideal when im out and dont want to use data. Unlike apples podcast player, has a 1.25x speed option, which is nice. Search and sort options for what youve liked/downloaded are lacking"
"Spotify Review. Great AppHowever, on certain accounts and/or phones some downloaded songs wont play offline. Using data or wifi often fixes issue. Other than that very easy to navigate and use. Please add a function to add your own downloaded songs without needing to sync via a computer"
Can't pull up the song lists anywhere. When I view an album or the playlist made by someone else I can't pull up the songs lists. It's been this way for the past several updates and hasn't been fixed. It's really inconvenientThe problem has progressed to me not being able to pull up the track lists in my own personal playlist. I have used spotify on android and pc so this is glaringly looking more like an iOS issueIm still using this app because its the only service that lets me listen to music in the background. Dont expect me to spend any money on spotify premium with these annoying UI issues
My review. So far this app has been aboloutly fantastic but my only recomendation is that it shouldnt  be an app were you need data and whenever the adds pop up it is quite anoying but i would still 100% defenetly recomend this app
"Amazing. Used to have regular Spotify, then switched to Premium.  Best choice I have probably made.  I can download all of my playlists and listen offline.  I also have unlimited skips and with the family plan, more than one member can have a premium account.  Never has glitched on me, there has never been issues for me.  I am in middle school and we have school issues chrome books and it lets me use my premium personal account which is amazing.  Probably my favorite app ever "
Spotify. Its great if you get Spotify premium. No ads and you can download your songs on your playlist if you dont want to use data or wifi. 10/10
"What Happened??. I have Spotify downloaded on my my personal Samson Galaxy 10 phone and my work iPhone. Starting in September 2020 on both devices it has started to constantly pause, glitch and freeze. It has been so bad I barely use Spotify anymore. You guys used to be amazing"
"This new update has crashed Spotify on my phone. Spotify crashes as soon as I try to open it. Ive tried to reset my phone, re-download, and wipe saved data. Very upset since I listen to music constantly and have a paid subscription "
best music provider. can we PLEASE be able to change the playlist covers to personal pictures on ios?
"Issue with downloaded songs. I have had Spotify premium for a couple years and only recently have I started to have issues with it. The songs I have downloaded to listen to offline,(which are 3,000 or so) are not loading unless I have the app open when I have WiFi or data on. I have never had this issue on this app. Its almost like my songs have to pre-load with the app open in order for me to play any song I have. Its not an issue with my storage as I have a lot of GB of storage on my phone. If you guys could fix that bug or whatever is causing that issue thatd be great. Thank you"
"EDIT: SUPER BUGGY. Ive had Spotify ever since it came out. Ever since the new update, its been super buggy. Keeps freezing and crashing. Also wont let me listen using my headphones in offline mode unless I have my data switched on. Used to be able to listen no problem while in offline mode. Hope they change this, but otherwise I love the features"
"jacked up. Is there a person employed who can&#39;t leave well enough alone? I am  blind and with the newest update, my playlists are  rendered useless i&#39;m usingPremium playlist songs put on can&#39;t access my own choices.Are you going to fix the problem in the personal song list, mobile phone, premium, or should I go some place else?"
"The ux is a disaster. The ux of the official app is a disaster. It plays songs you didnt ask for, then you try to get it back on track and it plays a snippet of a song you log out and back in, restart the app, etc to try and clear it, all to no avail.All I want to do is listen to my playlist in a random order, high school coder level stuff, no chance. The ads work perfectly though, so you have that going for you"
Spotify. Have again started to enjoy this incredible music app enabling me to listen to my favourite tracks and artists with ease which I highly recommend
GET ITT dispite the adds. I love Spotify its better then YouTube music. It allows you to have your phone off its available on Android laptop and iPhone and Roku .I just love it and it never takes so much of your data or battery. it has so many stations for so many things and for any emotion you have. its the best app tbh its even better than YouTube .it dose come with adds and things but it dose allow u to have 30 mins of no adds for free .  but overall its beautiful
"Great app, has one big problem. This a a really great music streaming app. I have a free account and use this app all the time.My one peeve is the &#34;Similar songs&#34; feature (or problem, depending on where you come from). I listen to a very set group of songs, because there is some music out there that I think is a little crude. Yes, I have the &#34;no explicit songs&#34; feature turned on, but I&#39;m pretty strict with what I like. I don&#39;t like how when I listen to an album, the app will start to play songs from some totally different band. I look through what songs are in the album, and the one that&#39;s playing is not on the list.If I want to find new music I&#39;ll go look for it. I don&#39;t want to be doing my schoolwork, listening to songs that help me stay focused, and all of a sudden get distracted by wondering what the heck this song is.I have the &#34;Don&#39;t play other songs when album is finished&#34; set to &#39;on&#39;, but this is coming smack within the middle of the album. I haven&#39;t listened to all the songs yet. If you guys can fix this &#34;playing suggested track&#34; problem, this would be a hands down five-star app. But the suggested tracks are really that much if a problem, so for now its three stars"
Eh. I have premium and for some reason when Im offline music doesnt work unless I turn on my data
suggested tracks. my spotify keeps playing suggested track in the middle of my albums. like its mixed in with my songs. it used to play them after the album was over and i dont know why its doing this now. i turned suggested tracks off too and it wont stop
Ok but. It would be 5 star if you didnt need data to listen to music when your not at home
"pausing at 10 seconds FIX IT. okay so spotify is great. love it. love music. its fricken amazing. but latelyyy it will pause at 9, 10, or 11 seconds and not play at all after that. its extremely annoying. PLEASE FIX THIS. (btw i have premium and it does it for downloaded songs, normal songs, with wifi, without wifi, with data, without data: AKA ive tried lots of things and it always stops at 9 10 or 11 seconds.)"
"Not impressed. This day and age I feel like apps produced by companies as large as Spotify have a common theme, ease of use. This app is not easily navigated and takes more time than normal to feel comfortable to the user. The home screen is very cluttered and overall very busy. Now for the only reason I downloaded the app in the first place, podcasts (for Joe Rogan). No option to download audio only??? You mean to tell me you thought it would be best to have users download 3 hours of video to listen to a podcast???? From what I can tell  is that they are working on/testing and option for audio only?? Why didnt they start with that and work up to the option to add video if you want?? Either way the app seems to be filled the bugs especially when using without data and streaming downloaded content (on an airplane)"
Data Saver Option for Cellular?. I really enjoy using the app but I really wish there were options to enable the Data Saver like Always or Over Cellular Only.Otherwise great
best music provider. but can we PLEASE be able to change the playlist covers to personal pictures on ios?
Review. Absolutely brilliant love this appIt hardly uses any data well on my phone
"Deep Cuts. I dig that Spotify goes deep to fine rare cuts. The only suggestion/request is to be able to play back tracks for free, even if it means to watch another ad. I also dig that Spotify offers to watch ads for free 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. Thank you"
More money for Artists. I love having all my favorite music at my fingertips- but Im gutted the musicians dont get money every time I download a track... I will leave Spotify as soon as a fair deal for artists music app comes out
Review from Spotify user. I absolutely adore Spotify Its amazing But I would love it if u could send notifications and keep us updated on new trending tracks and songs
"VPN Blocking - Worst New Feature. Spotify started blocking Nord VPN yesterday (Jan. 24th) and I am now unable to use the app. Whenever I try to load any page the app says Couldnt load the page. Try again?. Im a long time premium user, but if Spotify isnt willing to let privacy conscious VPN users access the app, then Ill switch to Apple Music"
This is the best. This app is the best music app ever its really easy to navigate sure u cant skip with subscription and u get ads but you can go through that other apps have it to and not to mention that spotify has so many different genres like english kpop bollywood jpop and podcasts like get real and so much more Not to mention u can save podcasts and songs so u can listen to songs offline with no wifi and data
"Downloads wont work without data?. Why in the heII did I buy premium if I cant even watch or listen to stuff without cellular connection???? My god its annoying..... penny pinchers at its finest... keep getting adds even though Ive payed to remove them.... whats the point of this app?? I downloaded this because some say its better than iTunes,,, my azzzzz"
doesnt work. my spotify hasnt been working for a week and i cant figure out why. no matter if i have my data on or im using wifi none of the songs will download or even play. when i stay off for a while it logs me out on its own and is very frustrating. please help because i need music
"The Watch Needs Streaming. Great service, but one bug shortfall. Weve asked in the community but you refuse to provide answers. Why cant we have streaming on our Apple Watches? When will we be allowed streaming on our Apple Watches?You are losing customers to Apple Music and frustrating the $#+ out of your customers. Do it, already"
"I loved it But now. Ok OK, Spotify was a great app. I loved all the song options, and I got to experience premium features for a month. The best part was the fact that there were slowed songs on there. I LOVE slowed songs, and since I can&#39;t have YouTube on my phone, I could still listen to the slowed music I liked. The slowed music was technically under &#34;episodes&#34; but I still loved listening to it. I had it for a week, all was well. But then I forgot to download a song. Into you by Ariana(it was slowed). I tried to listen to it with my data, thinking everything would be fine, but then, out of NOWHERE, ALL OF MY SONGS DISSAPEARD. And I had like, 25 FLIPPING SONGS(when I say songs, I mean slowed songs under episodes) I was MAD. And this has happened like, 3 times And the only ones that are left are the downloaded ones. I tend to find the slowed music when I&#39;m offline and using my data, so I wait to download them at home, but then I forget. So it is kinda my fault, but not EVERYONE IS GONNA DOWNLOAD THEM So this makes. Me. MAD. I hope this gets resolved, and I wonder if anyone has experienced this as well, or if it&#39;s just me"
"Why Spotify is the best. Spotify is the best music app out, hands down. Have all the music I want to hear and the opportunity to pay a fair price to download and save data. All the daily playlist and playlist in general are on point"
"App not up to par with other UIs. Really annoying that I have to go on my PC or desktop just to see my friend activity, also I think its dumb that my car play offers listening to music by genre, but no other platform does. Why is it that in my liked songs that Ive been accumulating for years, I cant just have it neatly divided by genre if I deem it necessary. Clearly the algorithm knows enough about genres to make playlists, so it must have enough data to simply allow me to choose all rock songs from my liked songs into a queue or playlists. Also allow us to make playlist folders on mobile. Used to think you guys were more creative than Apple before you were so big, stop spending capital partnering with Hulu and focus on fundamental UI"
"So calming. So calming to be able to put Spotify Premium on and listen to the great range of songs and genres available I listen inand sing and dance along in the privacy of my home or car, on pretty much a daily basis. Great background music to flood my day with as I go about various tasks. Background to boom as I raise the volume"
"Almost great. Ive been using Spotify for years now, and its been a pretty decent experience. For some reason, recently(past month or so) Ill try to listen to a new artist or any artist I havent played on the app, and it wont play any music. If Im connected to data it just wont play period and if Im on wifi, itll just constantly give me ads. Its very aggravating and I just want this to be fixed please and thanks"
"Blend. The only issue i have with spotify is the blend feature. every time my friend and i try to create one it says blend not found. weve tried clearing data, reinstalling the app, restarting our phones etc. the customer service reps werent really able to help so im guessing this isnt a common problem. doesnt take away from the app, i love it and use it everyday, just more of a disappointment"
Lose Rogan. Harmful information being spread by this malicious app. Listed as SPOT on the NYSE. Remove the app and sell your stock if you own it
"Music. I use this app so much, it takes up very little space when looking at how much music I have downloaded, the quality of the music is high, and I can make my playlists public or private. Would recommend this app Ps Im not a robot"
"Personal playlist. This app is very well rounded but there are some things that should be fixed. One of them being when you are listening a playlist you made it gives you songs that you might like. Its a cool feature but if I liked the song then I would have put it in my own playlist. Another think that should be fixed is the when you are listening to the song if you like it, like the preview of it, they should make it longer so we get a better fell of it"
"Worst. Every 3 months it forgets my banking info and makes me spend 15 minutes re adding it, most recently the app will play the first 40 seconds of a song and close app. Been using it for 4 years now and just switched to Apple Music"
Thanks for valuing my privacy. You cannot playback anything while using a VPN. Thats retarded
"Spartafy. Im a middle aged jaded guy, and my hip wife just turned me onto Spotify. The terrible guilt I sustained after selling off all of my incredible vinyl collection is waning, thanks to my angel"
"Its alright. I do think this is a pretty good app for listening to music, but it would be better if there was a option to block users or remove followers. Some people just like their privacy, and dont like when others follow them. Its kinda hard to explain, but I do think some user would appreciate this if someone they used to know is following them and they simply dont want them following them"
"This app is revolutionary to music. Spotify has got to be, by far one of the most powerful and influential music software programs ever. But of course all apps come with their imperfections. A problem for me is a bug that me and many others have faced. The app closes by itself a lot. Ive tried turning off power saving, restarting the phone, reinstalling the application but I always get the same result. It boots up and plays about half a song and cuts off. Strangely enough the only way Ive found to avoid this problem is to keep my phone on airplane mode while listening to music. But other than that small bug, the download speeds are incredible, the audio quality is top notch, the amount of influence it has on EVERY music community is phenomenal. Just a couple of tweaks to the performance of the software and this already beloved application could revolutionize the way we see music, podcasts and other audio entertainment forever. Furthermore, maybe a couple of tweaks to the shuffle algorithm perhaps? Feel as if I get the same songs every time around which is strange considering I have more than 2000 songs downloaded"
Great app. The only thing is that it can&#39;t be used offline or else it would gobble up all your data
"Its good, but theres a bug or two. For the most part Spotify is working just fine. Ive encountered an issue where a track will just stop at random or a track will skip to the next track at random in the middle of playing.  When the track stops, it will make me play from the beginning if Im using headphones. It also usually restarts without headphones as well.This used to happen occasionally, but now it happens constantly. If this doesnt get fixed Im not paying for premium anymore. I use music to help me cope. Its doesnt exactly help when it abruptly stops in the middle of a track"
"Good but. Spotify is a good app and all, its my main choice for music. But, it been pausing my music recently, with wifi or cellular data. This has only occurred on mobile devices for me. when I open the app again, the song I was listening to has started from the beginning. I tried refreshing, reinstalling, and resetting my phone, but the same still applies. please help"
"Love the app use it all the time but. Omg I love this app I use it all the time and its my most used on my phone. One minor issue, I dont have premium and I accidentally skip my favorites all the time. If you can give non-premium users the ability to back track their songs  it would be a 5 star review. Again keep up the great work this is my fav music app of all time "
New update?. You guys used to have songs based on playlist made for you after searching a song. Why would you get rid of that? Its so much more useful finding music that way rather than going to a song radio that over half the songs on that playlist are already on my liked songs. I dont need to see them there if I want to listen to them Ill go to my personal playlist. Actually super frustrating my music keeps stopping on its own. Which is super annoying while Im working or doing things around the house or even driving. Put that feature back and the world will be in a better place
"Apple Music all day. Used Spotify for 11 years. Switched and could not be happier. Dolby Atmos is amazing, lossless. Keep that shady data collection, happy using half the battery on Apple Music. Cant dislike tracks anymore? Forcing crap podcasts on us? Nah, we can do better"
"Disappointing. Whats the point of downloaded tracks library if you cant access it when offline. 7 days in a place with no reception, Spotify blocked my access to my Saved tracks. Not like the payment was overdue, I had no reception, hoped to listen to the tracks that had downloaded. Highly disappointing"
Spotify Apple Watch. Unusable on an Apple Watch 3. Can not play songs consistently or have the app track fitness with awful playback. Just dont offer for watch 3 if specs dont work. Its just absolute Trash
"Much respect. Thanks for continuing to keep Joe Rogan on your platform. It has never been miss information, its always been information. And the last I checked we live in America and we all participate in the first amendment. Its simple if you dont like something you dont have to watch or listen. Anyway thanks for standing up to all of this cancel culture"
My downloads keep dumping and the app WONT LET ME DOWNLOAD USING CELL DATA. If my wife didnt like this app I would delete it in an iheartbeat
Closes. Sometimes when Im using mobile data the app just closes itself stops playing music and the song I was listening to goes back to the start. Also adds random songs to my playlists that are nothing like the type of music I listen to
"Not working. I absolutely love Spotify but its just not working on my phone, its closing as soon as I open the app so I cant use it anymore, I have tried everything such as closing the app, uninstalling, turning my device off and even cleaning all my data in setting If anyone could help and let me know how to fix it, that would be great"
"Missing obvious features. 1- why cant you see your play history ?  Spotify, do you have any idea how annoying it is to play a track, and then get distracted or the playlist changes, and there is no way to go back and see the history of what was playing so you can go find your song again.2-Why cant you say you dislike a track?  guys, there are loads of tracks out there *I know* I will never want to hear again.... why cant I be doing the process of saying I dont like (or dont ever want to hear again) and I know that I never have to worry about them coming up again....?"
Needs improvment. 1. Maybe we can allow an unlimited song limit for a personal library?2.  Some artists I try to follow do not stay following.3.  I can no longer change the order of songs for a random shuffle?4.  There should be a filter option for unplayable songs
"App just closes after update. Loved spotify before, I pay for the upgrade and I can download songs to my library without using data. However, since the recent iPhone update; I believe Spotify automatically updated as well, it randomly shut off maybe 30 seconds into a song. Frustrating. If it doesnt get fixed, will definitely unsubscribe"
"Needs Personal Play Count. Cant fault the app at all, HOWEVER, it needs a personal play count"
"Offline support is really bad.  I mean really bad. Download your music to enjoy it offline and save on your data usage is an awesome feature. If it worked Be prepared to download your already downloaded music over and o er and over and over again. But wait it gets better, the app only downloads when it has focus so also be prepared to baby sit your phone every time you need to download (which seems to be every time I go on a road trip and realize all my music was deleted)Its frustrating, I actually enjoy the service otherwise but am considering something else"
Fraud. Horrible app they stole my bank info and used it to drain my bank account I thought I could trust them since they were a big company but I was sorely mistaken
"Its the best app so far. I have Amazon, Tidal, Apple Music, and a serious collection on Plex. Its Spotify that gets the use. Its user playlists, recommended tracks, and speed of delivery are spot on, and its access to media on any bandwidth is excellent. If only it paid artists properly"
"Does NOT respect my music choices by adding other songs to my playlists. Does NOT respect my music choices by adding other songs to my playlists Its MY personal account  You ruin the whole experience of listening to FAV music, plus there are more ads than ever ? PS dont make it any harder to review"
Ads. I dont mind the ads just wish they werent videos it is sucking up my data turn to audio only the I will come back
Review. Personally I think Spotify is one the best apps to Listen to music and podcasts etc however my only issue is the adds I know  you can buy premium (which I have recently started paying for) but people who cant perhaps not  afford premium are stuck to listen to several adds In between songs and you are also forced to use your mobile data so if there is an option to fix all that I would have give it a higher rating
"Too much ads. Too much ads, dont you have enough with collecting my data and selling it to third parties?"
"Downloads removed. Hi. When I updated the app, all my personal playlist downloads were removed. I have checked the Support and Im doing all the right things (going online within 30 days, etc). Why does this happen every time I update the app? Should I not update? I listen to music most of the day and dont always have internet access so need to be able to listen offline with my downloads"
"Keeps crashing. I have done literally everything from hard reset, to deleting all data and starting anew, to logging out and back in, literally everything imaginable and the app still crashes. I know its not my storage because I dont even use 25% of my storage on the phone or in icloud. Whatever is going on, i am probably going back to Apple Music even though some music through them is regionally restricted, i need my music at work. Until spotify fixes the crashing, i will be looking into getting my subscription cancelled"
"Not too good. Im confused as to why I cant choose a specific song to play or when I play an album it doesnt play the actual album but a track of the artists songs? Might be me not knowing how to use the app, if so its not as easy to use. I only downloaded Spotify because GooglePlay isnt on anymore, but seems likes Spotifys layout isnt as good"
"Poor value. Im paying for a family access package, but we cannot listen to different tracks on different devices. Changing to Apple Music"
"ADs. Pay 10$ monthly to listen to music with no ads, except have to pay additional just to play tracks (downloaded) ridiculous expensive service"
5 star for a reason you can play every good song and no need to use data in the car. 5 star
"Horrible for podcasts. I switched to Spotify to follow my favorite podcast that went to Spotify exclusive. The app is so awful that Im leaving my favorite commute podcast to get rid of it. -It always accesses cell phone data or wifi. Even if I download an episode theres no way to use the app and avoid this. My data usage has skyrocketed because of it since I listen in my commutes -you cant set it to automatically download new episodes of podcasts you subscribe to. You have to manually click each episode to download-it doesnt automatically delete a download when youve listened to it, you have to lanugo in and delete each episode"
Some suggestions for you. Songs lyrics needed as an option. Shazam type feature needed. Better links to tv/film suggestions based on other media data history. If you know what Im watching youll be better able to understand what I like to listen to. Netflix style account profiles for better sharing of accounts amongst the family (eg. Kids vs adults accounts)
Love Spotify. I used to buy music for 79p a track now its a one payment for the year and I can listen to anything I like as much as I like  Needless to say I have never looked back 
"Songs download. Spotify is my favorite music app, it will be perfect if I can download the tracks one by one not the whole playlist or Album.Thanks for opening in Iraq"
"Spotify more like Rob me fy. Absolute dogs dinner of an app.I could write compose record sell a song before Spotify has drawn breath. THE ABSOLUTE WORST EVER MUSIC APP, that takes ur money in seconds sometimes early yet makes u wait two weeks for laggy skipping track or just playing whatever the hell it wants. Avoid like the plague"
"Songs refuse to play. Im on the latest iOS and app version, more than half of the time a song comes up it will play one second and stop at 0:00. It happens on network data, wi-fi and even when the song is fully downloaded on my device, so it is definitely a Spotify issue"
"Good, but not enough control. I use it all the time but find that Im always looking for more controls within the app. For example, I cant just simply access the data I produce like song plays, history, etc. I also cant make folders of music, only one level of playlists which make it hard for me to categorize the music I listen to. Little things like that would make it 5/5"
"New update is buggy. Ever since updating my app recently so I could use the Blend feature, I can no longer listen to music when Im connected using mobile data. All my songs and playlists are greyed out which is extremely frustrating considering I pay for a premium membership each month. Might have to cancel my subscription and go back to Apple Music if this issue isnt fixed :("
"Wow. Spotify is amazing especially family premium its so good and helpful if your reading this and you dont have Spotify get it now you listen to podcasts, music, it even makes a personal playlist based on my favourite music and related to it"
I have a lot of complaints. I have a lot of complaints but my main complaints are when I make my personal playlist they will always add songs I both 1 dont like and 2 I never add and always skip them if I hadnt already wasted my other 6 skips on songs they added that I dont like my other complaint is shuffle play in general why do we need to pay for ability to play songs in the order we want them in it should at lest be a choice to put it like that my last complaint is how if you dont have premium you only get 6 skips a hour and when shuffle play is on like always for people without premium it gets annoying getting 7 songs in a row that you hate and its happened multiple times
It meets all standards. No ads it has quality music easy to add a song onto your playlist another good thing is that you can download the playlist so you can listen to it offline for incase you dont have mobile data or dont want to use it up
"Wish you could still listen offline. Its very good, but I wish you listen to songs offline without having to use data"
To many ads and annoying suggested tracks. The ads are non stop and repetitive there all ways the some ones to plus it dose the annoying thing where it plays a suggested track its never related to the music Im listening to. for example you could be listening to heavy Metal then it plays Christmas songs and to skip them you have to use your skips which doesnt always work because theres to many songs there never good songs to or I just dont like that music please just add skips remove the suggested tracks or make them completely skippable honestly this app would do better and be better if there was less ads and no more annoying suggested tracks the suggested tracks and to many ads are driving me away from using the app I feel like this company cares more about the ads then the app quality just stop with the ads
There is something better. So if you use an apple produce like a phone or iPad the is an app called Musi and you can listen to it the exact same and you don&#39;t have to pay and there are no adverts in the middle of your music it also works when there if no internet if you have mobile data
Changed the music industry forever. Simple to use Personal customisation of my music Affordable Podcasts are easy to access Works on multiple devices.Up to date with technology
Since updating I cant click on songs while using mobile data. All the settings are right. iPhone 12. Mobile data enabled in-app and in the iPhone system settings. I can still play songs and flick to the next song on a playlist but I cant click the sing as it is greyed out. Not greyed out on wifi. Looks like an update bug
Apple Watch. Wish it would work alone on my Apple watch with data so that I dont have to take my phone with me on my runs
Okay app. Uses To Much Data
Personal Playlist Covers. Hello Spotify is really good to me and I use it all the time I also recently found myself making a lot of playlists and thought to myself How cool would it be to let playlist covers be a gif. Sounds pretty cool. Hope you consider this idea as part of a new update to make playlists more personalized
"Why did you add songs to my personal songs. Why did you guys add songs to my songs, Like I have a song called Miss me More and i like replaying it to listen to it again but then it plays a song that says We added. I hate that you added that and I dont know how you take off the ones you added"
Refuses to play some songs. I have had premium for maybe a year or so now and havent had many problems until this update. Other than the issue where it wont let me play my downloaded music that hasnt been downloaded within a week the app now flat out refuses to play certain songs even with connection. I dont know what the problem is. Theyre some of my favorite songs too but Spotify just wont let me listen to them. Ive tried shutting off my phone re-downloading the app and everything I could think of but this issue wont resolve itself
NEED WIFI FOR MUSIC?. You literally need to be CONNECTED to wifi in order to listen to music. Cellular data doesnt cut it . Also a lot more ads 2-3 play every 5-10 minutes. Its ridiculous. Going back to SoundCloud
"8.5.56 not working (Edit: working fine now). Edit (5-9-20): No more issues since first editEdit: (1 minute after submitting) And it&#39;s working again.Title says it, was playing fine then just stopped. Tried to close app, restarted phone, nothing works. Turned off data and the app will stay open, turn it back on and the app closes. iphone x, ios 13.4. Spotify stations is working, but I&#39;m paying for the service for this app"
"Love Spotify. I love Spotify so much, I use it almost everyday. I make playlists and enjoy that they will introduce you to more music based on your personal taste and likes. 5/5 stars, in Australia we know this as the southern cross. Kawabunga dudes"
"Algorithms. I find the spotify experience is much better when its not tracking what songs I like. Once I deleted all my likes, my daily mixes were more improved at listening to new music of styles/genres that I like. Otherwise, they are filled with shuffled liked songs and I never discover anything new. I wish there was a way to download an album offline without having to automatically have the album added to my liked music. Most often I simply want to give an album a listen offline as I dont want to use up my data plan. Also, please fix new album release notifications. This worked only a few times the last several years. What happened?"
HACKED. It was decent for a couple years and then I got hacked putting my personal info in danger along with my credit information. Id highly recommend iTunes over this app. Customer support is horrible as I tried to report it but it sent me to the same page for how to report it. The solution took awhile to find as well
"Great content but piss poor functionality. It takes forever (1,2,5 mins) to load just the names of tracks or podcasts. Spotify often is offline even with full bars of data and cell service and all other apps working fine. Material that was downloaded will not play offline. Thinking of switching to apple music or something. Very dissapointed"
"Bye-bye. Companies have an obligation to shut down things they know to be false-pretending-to-be-real. This company tracks and sells all of your info then when you want out, there is no avenue for unsubscribing (on the free version). Boo"
Personal playlist. I wish I could move songs up or down in my personal playlists. Other than that its great
"Kills my data. My downloaded music doesnt play without mobile data turned on and it just kills my data. If I turn data off, the music just doesnt even play even though it shows as being downloaded. I hope this will be resolved soon"
Its okay. For me personally it wasnt really that good because I need offline music as I like to listen to it in my bus and I dont have lots of data to waste on music everyday. If you just need to listen to music and you have data/WiFi then it works like any music app
"Get it together. Honestly how can your app be so inconsistent when you have so many users? Regularly songs will just not play, same with podcasts. This is regardless of Im on data or WiFi the app just doesnt work. Paying fro premium just to avoid ads doesnt get you much in terms of reliability for an app thats meant to play music and podcasts. Because its just does not work all the time. Pathetic guys"
Premium vs Free. I really love this app but the fact that you have to pay $9.99 a month just to choose a specific song or have unlimited skips with no ads seems kinda ridiculous. Other than that the app is decent but to listen to music offline on the free version you have to use data. Some might not enjoy that
"Brilliant. I was using Apple Music for a long time but certain music tracks was never available, however moving over to Spotify was best move as so much content available. Will be a customer for a while I think "
Use to love premium. I use to love this app but recently Ive been having to reinstall the app bc it doesnt load my downloaded songs and I pay to listen to music offline but Ive been having to use my data bc the music doesnt even play and when I reinstall the app all my downloads are gone. Im gonna have to use Apple Music now. Idk if its bc I have an iPhone but its never done this until now
Review. Love the music but dont appreciate the political and personal health care commercials
"Lyrics, downloads. Should offer lyrics on all songs, also some albums have additional tracks which you do not carry vs. Apple. Can be kind of complicated to download songs to have saved to your phone"
Spotify Slowify. I have trouble getting it to play the already downloaded albums and I dont want extra tracks added. More information and the lyrics would be nice but I suppose I would have to pay for premium plus extra supreme with tassels
Seriously?. My app just signed me out on its own and is now refusing to sign back in saying the info is incorrect. And the only way to contact them is by being signed in? More trash of 2022 
"Needs to be better for one thing. I go look up a certain song to listen to. But instead of going straight to said song, the app goes to a playlist that has it and plays a different song. It also applies to picking a song on a playlist I get being able to listen similar tracks to the song I want to hear, but it doesnt mean much if I cant listen to my chosen song first. The app should get an update that lets you listen any song of choice without having to skip several different tracks to get to it. And DONT LET IT BE PREMIUM ONLY"
"Love the app. I personally love the app I only got it around 4 months ago but Ive been using it almost every single day on the bus ride to school and back. The only problem is that you need premium to skip and listen to music offline. If youre limited to a small amount of data a month, then Id recommend using something like sound cloud"
"log in account problems. the app greate but logs you out with no reason and when you devided a 10minutes to listen to music it takes alot to find among facebook apple or login tabs which was yours and log in back. it notmally says your password is incorrect and to revive it, for some, no password reset link you recieve.i cant understand why this serious privacy for a simple music app. it took 30min for me to log in back and listen to a music"
Killing my phone and my data limit. Great app But recently its been using up 41GB of data for 20 min of predownloaded music Also its killing my battery
Great analytics. I play the songs I like and team Spotify puts together a great track for my listening enjoyment:)Much more in tune with my taste than competition
"Making your own sound track. I recently was using pandora and found out it cost money to make your own sound track. All of my friends told me to switch to Spotify, so I did. And that was probably the best choice I ever made I love creating my own sound tracks and playlist for every season of the year I definitely would recommend this for anybody who is picky with their music I literally use Spotify everyday on my way to school"
"Premium is a total disappointment. I paid for premium only to be able to listen without using up my data. But every time I go to use it, my playlists arent there I should not have to download everything repeatedly every couple of weeks, it is total nonsense. If Ive downloaded it and paid for the privilege to do so, it should be there until I cancel my subscription"
"Super Hot Spotify. I AM NO LONGER A HUMAN BEING BUT ACTUALLY AN ALGORITHM.  Help me, Ive transcended to hashtags and key words- its a thing and its not funny. Ill see all those more-magical moments that were shaped by your bots mining my data , and raise you those same moments BUT without the (albeit, unintentional) paranoia that is oh-too-commonplace in todays internet purgatory I am now trapped in. Ignorance is bliss. And so are the Violent Femmes. It all comes out in the wash. Whatever"
To many ads and suggested tracks. The ads are non stop and repetitive there all ways the some ones to plus it dose the annoying thing is where it plays a suggested track its never related to the music Im listening to. for example you could be listening to heavy Metal then it plays Christmas songs and to skip them you have to use your skips which doesnt always work because theres to many songs there never good songs too or I just dont like that music please just add skips remove the suggested tracks or make them completely skippable honestly this app would do better and be better if there was less ads and no more annoying suggested tracks the suggested tracks and to many ads are driving me away from using the app I feel like this company cares more about the ads then the app quality just stop with the ads
Lack of VPN Compatability. Title says it all. How can I support a paid service that doesnt allow always on VPN? Ill download songs but that isnt a solution for me. Im not a fraudulent customer so dont make my experience worse because Im following basic personal privacy standards
Best streaming music app. My personal favorite music streaming app. Less bugs and more songs with the free service than others
". Sometimes the app dosent work for me but deleting and re-installing it usually sorts it out, great range of songs, podcasts and playlists to listen to and i like how its a different expirience for everyone as the app is personal to you and your taste "
"Cant play music while outside/offline. I am writing this hoping that an employee of Spotify will notice this. Ive had the app since 2017, there have been no problems with the music or the app until recently. When my phone isnt connected to any WiFi or data, all of my downloaded music wont play. In fact, all the songs Ive downloaded act as if they were never downloaded onto my phone in the first place. If I close the app, all the songs I tried to play and listen to while offline now need to be re-downloaded. Ive had nothing but good things to say about the app but this just makes me question continuing to keep paying Spotify as this has been happening for a good while with other people I know as well. If theres something I need to do or if this is something that is being looked at then please let me know.(I saw that the best thing is to delete the cache on the app but Im still have the same issues)"
data. you should let us use this app even if our data is slow because mine is right now and it isnt working
Premium. My premium isnt letting me listen without data
"Lacking, and annoying. Seriously lacking on the voice assistant integration front. Cant add to playlists in either Siri or Alexa.The lack of privacy settings, such as the ability to block followers or to keep private sessions is atrocious. Forces you to but a family subscription if you want to avoid having music you play for toddler messing up your playlist. Hey Siri, play The Wiggles on Spotify. It will play a one wiggles song, and then a mix of random kids songs and pop songs. Does this for a lot of requests.Completely ignore their community. Go look at the community suggestions and you will see what I mean. Key features with no movement for almost a decade.I really cant believe this app is as popular as it is. Its completely lacking to the competition"
Username and password combination does not match. So I recently upgraded to and iPhone 11 from my iPhone 7. I transferred all my data to my new phone and tried logging into my Spotify account. It says my username and password combination is wrong. I have my username and password saved on my iPhone and it still says its wrong and I know Im putting in the right username and password but it still wont let me log in
GREAT BUT ONE PROBLEM. Its a great app I love the personal taylored playlists The mix of new is great for the morning and the wellness mix is AWESOMe for relaxation BUT if I block an artist I want song they are featured on to be blocked too even if they made a song with an artist that I liked That is my only problem Other than that I love this app
"Spotify Rate. I love Spotify so much and here are some reasons why-you can stream your favorite songs for free-there are podcast -you can create a library full of your fav songs-it keeps track of how much you listen to it every year -to download it, it is completely free Those are just a few of the reason s Spotify is so awesome "
Problem. Every time I turn my data off and then turn it back on for what ever reason my music stops and change to another song and thats really annoying
Needs improvment. 1. Maybe we can allow an unlimited song limit for a personal library?2.  Some artists I try to follow do not stay following.3.  I can no longer change the order of songs for a random shuffle?4. Now my app keeps crashing
"Glitchy and wont play podcasts. Spotify is the worst, least user friendly podcast app on the market. It regularly doesnt play episodes well or at all, nor does it allow you to play the episodes as audio only and forces the video. This incurred me expenses by going over my monthly data rate. Literally the only reason worth having this app is Rogan and they cant even do that right"
App info sent to Germany. I received a notification that my information was being sent to Germany. Since I am otherwise unable to prevent that from happening I am removing the app. Sorry
"Love the app but. It was so much better before  Honestly the colour in the corners when you swipe up on the track is SO ANNOYING, I really hate the shuffle button where it is, and why the album art on playlists? Plz stop trying to fix what aint broke and bring og Spotify back cuz it was so much better "
Good but . I found this app grate to stream my favourite songs and podcasts and i thought it was great and didnt use that much of my mobile data like YouTube but  when premium ran out I found it hard to find my songs and when Id click on the song it would come up with a nother one instead of the one that I wanted and that bugged me and also loop stopped working when premium ran out so I had to keep rewinding it .it hasnt had a bug fix I quite a bit and the app is very slow for me mad when i come on it just keeps saying connecting.. all the way through when i was playing a song and it would always stop at at a certain point on the song out out by Joel Corey and that would annoy me .So thats why I rate it a 4 star
Ease of use. Not quite as user friendly as Amazon Music so far but does have certain tracks that Amazon have removed from my playlist with them so will continue on
Personal. Best music app ever
Yes. I wish you could go with no WiFi or cellular data because I want to listen to music on the bus but I dont have unlimited data
"Why is there a suggested track?. I was listening to my music and all of a sudden three songs I didnt put in my playlist started playing, I ran out of skips and couldnt get past them so I could listen to my music. Wth Spotify"
"Good. I love this app but the only downside is that it uses data when ur out and about so if u r on a train ,bus etc... u cant listen to anything without data"
Very convenient and personal. I enjoy the personalized playlists and recommended artists/podcasts that seem tailored to my tastes
"Too much data usage. Great app, but taking up too much data for some reason"
Download. This feature is so good because I dont have to use data all I have to do is download the songs on wifi
"FAKE app, will steal your money. I paid for premium and now the whole thing is locked down and my account no longer exists to third party people. You can hit buttons all you want NOTHING happens. Ive deleted a playlist 5 times and its still there. Click on a song and the screen blinks and nothing happens. Ive contacted my bank about fraud. I thought this was a real app with so many people who SUPPOSEDLY use it. But nope. Its another scam app stealing your info. How is this even a thing? How big is this scam that literally THOUSANDS of people are in on it. Contacting the FBI and CIA now"
Uses to much data. Why does it play video?  I just want listen
Does to much. I was trying to make a playlist and Spotify added music I didnt like. I was annoyed so I was trying to delete the music they added but it wouldnt let me. So instead I downloaded pandora
Spotty service. Was a paid member then I was hacked. Ever since my listening experience just stops at random spots because who ever has my sign in info plays while Im listening
Trash. The app used to be fine but recently it wont even let me listen to my own playlist and plays some suggested track. Probably switching to Apple Music
"Disgraceful. This app used to be okay, but recently theyve revamped their agenda of corporate greed, to the point its made the app nearly unusable without shelling-out for premium. (Ive frequently had to listen to 15 minutes of adds before getting to the content Im trying to enjoy). For the price of premium, I suggest you get more data, and just use YouTube. Its free, the adds arent 15 minutes of your time, and theres a much larger variety of content. PS. I had two accounts, one with premium, but when I saw how outrageous the adds have become, I canceled my membership, and have deleted the app. I dont give money to people who try to bully their consumers like this, and hope no one else will either"
"Excellent. I love Spotify, my access to music and conversation seems limitless. The addition to having Podcasts is huge So many different conversations to listen to, so much music to hear Let freedom ring baby"
"Watch download featue not working. I bought an apple watch as soon as spotify announced that the feature was available. I tried on my iPhone and the app won&#39;t download anything to the watch. Now I&#39;m stuck with a worthless watch, and a worthless premium subscription.Don&#39;t tell customers you can do something when in reality you can&#39;t. This is fraudulent behavior, and Apple should remove your app from the App Store until you fully support the feature"
"New update makes downloading nearly impossible. Ever since Spotify updated my songs and podcast that I download to play on my walks(so I dont need to run data) will take hours to download. A week ago I could download episodes and songs in seconds. I dont know what they changed but it is really frustrating, I have to start downloading three or more hours before I plan on listening. Super inconvenient"
"Overall great, but. I love using Spotify, I can keep track of my favorite songs and do other things on my phone at the same time. However, there have been multiple times when Ive been in another app or my phone is off and the music just stops. I turn on my phone and it appears the app keeps crashing. If it werent for that, Id give it 5 stars. Please fix this Thanks"
"Whats the point of paying for an app that doesnt let me listen to music offline. I pay for this music app, and I download all the music in my liked songs yet as soon as I run out of data it deletes all my songs, whats the point of paying for an app when I cant listen to it offline"
"Too much data got it glitched up. Get a strong developer team if you want to go harder creatively. There is a lot of data going on like art canvas, lyrics and all that. It can be possible but it has become a whole glitch problem. This is the future of music so keep up. It crashes everything I close my screen then restarts the song so annoying going to use Tidal bro"
"Won't stop crashing. I&#39;ve been a Spotify Premium member for many months. The app broke or something today I guess.It won&#39;t stop instantly crashing as soon as I open the app. I tried refreshing the background, restarting my phone, and deleting data and reinstalling the app. Still keeps crashing.If this doesn&#39;t get fixed soon I&#39;ll have to unsubscribe to my premium"
"Spotify keeps crashing?. Spotify has been my go to, and has never acted out until recently. Every time I open the app using WiFi it kicks me out. Only allowing me to use cellular data. Ive tried deleting and reinstalling the app which has no affect on the issue. Ive even tried turning off the cellular data option for Spotify and it still hasnt worked"
Its ok. My biggest problem is that I cant skip more than six times I also cant listen to music without data
"Really good app. Ok so this app does need premium for all of the features (which I do not have) but despite this it provides high quality music which doesnt require a lot of data and doesnt take up a lot of battery. My liked songs playlist was working in a loop but suddenly they started to add random songs which I didnt know in as well but otherwise this is a really good appP.S. when you use Spotify on laptops or iPads, you can play whatever song you want and dont need shuffle play (but u can turn it on if desired) which I think is kinda unfair for those with just phones but I would still recommend this app to everyone."
"Pretty Good. Its pretty good, listening to this app pretty much since i was able to own a phone. Ive got my own peaces with it, ive got my own problems. I guess since this is a review ill list the problems first, first of all the amount of ads. Youll get 3-4 and 2 of them are usually spotify premium. And they have these 30 minute breaks for watching a video. Well, i have unlimited data, but it still gets throttled like most services. But you dont have a choice wether to watch these videos or not. And sometimes it doesnt even give you the reward, just makes you watch it. And that of course, is a drag on data, in a week i can rack up 1.5 gigs of data used from just listening to it every once and a while. Oh yeah, and the inability to be able to buy premium with the app. Thats not very cool, you advertise this great service every 15 minutes in 3 different ads, but im sadly unable to buy it do to not having a computer to do it on"
Sorry have to remove. Due to the support of spreading of information I will be removing this app from my phone
Always one star until they allow me to delete my recent listening history.thats my data right?. Mmmm not as much as you think. Try finding and storing a few radio stations
To many vape ads also stop saying a dont know what an a track tape is. Yeah
"Lack of support for mobile users. As a mobile user, Ive had this app for 3 years, and theres an incredible lack of tools. You cannot change your playlists icon picture unless youre on desktop, you cannot write a bio for your playlists in the app, and you cannot purchase premium from the app. It just seems like the creators pay more attention to the layout of the app than the actual control abilities for users"
"Great but not 5. I dont give the app a five I guess because Im used to xbox spotify, you can start with anysong and replay it as much as you want as well as skip ,Thats all spotify Premium benefits on here. Idk Thats just my personal reason. Its great though bc Im coming across old songs I have in the back of my 500 song playlist"
Ideas for you guys. Be able to edit personal album covers on the phone app and have more song meanings along with each song
Best streaming app Except w/ Apple Watch. I have this and share it with all my family Its great and my family is super thankful. Love sharing music and staying up to date with my favorite music and concerts I just wish that it worked with the Apple Watchs data plan Thats the only thing that grinds my gears because I have to have my phone with my internet order to stream music I hope it changes sometime soon :)
Music pausing. I have been using Spotify for a very long time now and have never had a problem with it. Recently my account has been pausing a lot and Im not able to even play a whole song befor it pauses. My account was also hacked and someone got my card information where over 500 dollars was taken from my credit card. I used the strong password suggestion and when it was hacked the first time it worked for about a week then it went back to pausing all the time. There are clearly some bugs that need fixed. I updated my app and everything so I just dont know whats going on. Not happy at all
"Cancel my account, I dont want Joe Rogan sharing bad info. Joe Rogan does not deserve to spread false information"
"$15 a month and more bugs than a free app. The algorithms are a joke, my discover weekly regularly consists of artists I already have on playlists.. how am I supposed to discover someone I already listen to? Ive spent hours of my life searching for playlists because the search function is completely broken. Pages of playlists will come up with literally nothing in common with the search terms. It requires genuine effort and planning to make an app this clunky, and its incredible that they actually CHARGE PEOPLE MONEY to deal with this neglect. I cant even search for users on the PS4 app, and on mobile I can no longer see how many songs are in a playlist. Why would you restrict so many features that would LITERALLY COST YOU NOTHING to users who PAY FOR THE FREAKIN APP? You get some kind of sick thrill out of watching me struggle?"
Hello. The only problem is that it always goes down for me it tells me theres no Data I never have this problem using Amazon music o Apple just this application see if you guys can fix it
Skips tracks half way through. Ive had Spotify for years and love it. But after the most recent update i cant listen to a full song. Around halfway to 3/4 of the song it skips to the next one. Its really been annoying me since i use the app for every part of my day
STUPID I HATE UR APP. IT SHOULD GIVE U YOUR ACCOUNT INFO IF YOU HAVE A NEW PHONE TO LOG IN SUCH A DUMB APP I HATE IT
"Lots of room for improvement. For being the official app of the biggest streaming platform in the world, the app has several issues which are just inexcusable in 2020 and hamper day-to-day use. One example is browsing your music with a spotty Internet connection. Even if the music&#39;s already downloaded, you can forget browsing unless you&#39;re completely online or offline. Instead, the app will just show a loading screen that doesn&#39;t go away until you turn off WiFi and/or cellular data. Isn&#39;t the point of offline downloads that your music should be available regardless of Internet connection?Same goes for album covers. If your device isn&#39;t online, your collection will be a mix of album covers and empty, grey boxes"
"very disappointed. I like to listen to music especially when i exercise, but these days, ive been exercising inside my house. However, whenever I use Spotify, its always crashing even if I have three bars of wifi. So I decided to use my data since it keeps crashing when I use wifi, but even with data, its crashing. I cant even listen to a full song because it keeps crashing. I would give this zero stars if I could"
"Still crashes, not buying premium again until this is fixed. The app used to be good but since around iOS 14 release the app just closes if I leave the app while listening to music so I HAVE to leave my phone on regular power mode and turn off auto lock and stay within the app in order to listen to music its very sad because I can just do that with YouTube. I cant lock my device or switch apps without Spotify crashing and logging out/deleting data/reinstalling/resetting/powering off phone does not fix the problem. My 3GB of RAM on my 7 Plus should be more than enough for your app"
"Its pretty good, improvements could be made. - Would love to be able to create folders and organize playlists on mobile. - An option available where songs that arent downloaded may be played only when selected or queued while using cellular data may be helpful. I find it irritating to either turn off the auto-play feature, turn off cellular data for the app, or use offline mode for only a couple hours"
Songs gone. I cant play entire playlist without turning on data and the only reason I got premium is so I would not have to use my cell data. Then all my songs I downloaded is gone Puff just gone. Im starting to dislike this app
Disappointed. Also my Spotifys personal songs that I put in not happy
Amazing. This app is really good I can listen to music without using up my data when I am in the car because I have downloaded my playlist
Great App. No ads it just feels good to listen to a music app where they dont give you a limit to skip a track
"Offline Is Broken In Current Version. Always make it a point to download albums Id like to listen to throughout my workweek without using my data (duh). I download the albums as usual this past Friday and start one, only to find that it stopped playing after a single track, even though the entire album is downloaded. Please fix this ASAP, yall. Offline is the best part of Spotify and this is really a huge downer"
Lyric and download to offline. Post the lyrics of the trackAnd provide an offline option so I know which tracks I have on cloud and my phone
"Fix the UI for music that I interact with: playlists and liked music. I need a consistent interface for accessing my likes music and playlists that I have created.  I am sick of you hiding the playlists that I have created.  Let me order them.  This frustration has me near the point of canceling my subscription for one of your competitors.  Why dont I have a filter UI for my music??? I like songs and you keep that data for your own use without giving me the ability to select my liked songs that I want to listen to. Why cant I filter songs by playlist, genres, and songs that I have liked into a list?"
"Stop it. The app is good but whenever I try to play an artist, liked songs, or even my own playlist, it automatically goes to play suggested track, which is very annoying because it takes hours of playing to cut it off. If you fixed this problem I would be able to give the app five stars, but right now Im staying at two"
"So simple. Brilliant, easy to use.Just to say I appreciate your new data baseUser friendly"
I sold my records and 8tracks. I can find almost anything Im looking for on Spotify and it weighs less than a bookPlease fix shuffle to actually shuffle playlistsIts the only annoying trait this program has &lt;3
"8.5.56 not working. Edit: (1 minute after submitting) And it&#39;s working again.Title says it, was playing fine then just stopped. Tried to close app, restarted phone, nothing works. Turned off data and the app will stay open, turn it back on and the app closes. iphone x, ios 13.4. Spotify stations is working, but I&#39;m paying for the service for this app. L"
Simply awesome. Spotify literally has everything and the audio quality is always top-tier. I really appreciate how it also keeps track of your top artists and songs etc. I really enjoyed the Wrapped 2021 (Spotify users will know what I mean) and look forward to more. It felt really personal and Im so appreciative because music means a lot to me. So thank you x1000000 ur the best
Deleted songs . So Im in the military and I go extended periods of time without WiFi and there are some bases on deployment where you cant have data on... with that be said its particularly miserable. So when I found out all my downloaded songs were slowly deleted I was very upset
"Music Doesnt Play and Support Is No Good. My music constantly stops playing even when it is downloaded. I can be online, offline, have a playlist, or an album. It stops in the middle of songs and Ive downloaded playlists while online them change it to offline to save data and half the playlists arent there or downloaded. My mom had the same problem and Spotifys help staff said it wasnt their fault and it was hers. We have deleted the app and re-installed it as well as tried downloading while offline and online. Nothing helps. We are cancelling Spotify and getting something more reliable. This is ridiculous"
Great app. This is amazing takes up almost no data thats what matters to me really
The app for false information. Its the Joe Rogan app
Great app. I love the fact that it also has podcasts but its privacy policy
Unhappy. Periodically this app stalls and doesnt play my music no matter if Im on WiFi its been downloaded or using cell data .. VERY FRUSTRATING considering canceling it
"Love the app, but its buggy & takes up a lot of space. I have to close and reopen the app a few times to get everything to load, including the option to add specific podcast episodes to my own playlists. Today, it kept crashing and lagging  especially more so when i had the data saver feature turned on. And, tired of this app taking up a lot of space  over 500MB?? I know i save a lot of stuff, but it used to never be that big. The cache this app collects is utterly ridiculous, and thats probably part of the reason why its so buggy. So, i hope the developers look into that and have an update solution. Overall, this is my favorite app to stream music and podcasts; i really love the suggestions and made-for-me playlists Spotify puts out, and im psyched at how much variety in content that it has "
"Its amazing to use but. I love this app, its fantastic except I get ads every second after watching the 30 minute un-interrupted listening ad I keep getting ads. Also, I dislike the suggested songs the app gives me so I made my personal playlist on Liked Songs except I keep getting more and more suggested songs that I dislike if you really could do something about this I would be extremely grateful"
Just download it so u save your music on an apps data base rather than iTunes. Yeah mad
"Krapp App. Agreed, completely useless if you just want to listen to a track or album. Serve your customers what they want. Downloaded the app and then five minutes later, deleted it. My mate says Apple Music is much  better"
"Could be better. Ive been using Spotify for years, and its been great until recently. The app has been crashing a lot lately. I can get through only a few songs before a song cuts off. Sometimes I cant even get through one. Also, I dont like that as a free member I cant view the track list to albums. I dont know if thats just a mobile thing. But it was nice being able to view and preview the songs when I clicked on the album"
"Deleted all my downloaded albums. I deleted a tonne of music to listen offline and then one day, none of it was downloaded anymore. In SA, data is expensive. We cant stream all the time"
Optional video. I came to Spotify for JRE but I do dislike it because of the video connected to the podcast. It makes loading the audio that much harder in low data areas. The video should be optional to have a smoother listening experience
"please fix the collaborative playlist. okay so this app is good for me to make playlists with my significant other. we have had a collaborative playlist that was started 6 months ago and it serves as a comfort playlist. however lately we have had people finding the playlist and adding random songs that add up to hundreds upon hundreds of hours of songs we have to take the time to remove. this is becoming a huge hassle and both will cancel our premium subscription if this issue persists. it cannot be that hard to select profiles that you can collaborate with, so that no strangers can add onto them. just for a bit if privacy please fix this"
this is amazing. this app is really good for people who like listening to music the only thing is that you can use it off of wifi and data only and you have to listen to adds but that is okay
"My personal opinion. I like Spotify. Ive been using it since 2015 I believe. Its been my go to app to play music. And yeah Apple Music would be much easier to use and simpler, but Spotify will introduce you to new artists and find other playlists made by your favorite streamers or friends and listen to the same music as well. Spotify helped me through so much. And I will advise you to try Spotify and the premium if you can"
Premium is the best. Ever since I got premium I use nothing else to listen to music I downloaded my playlists so I dont use data when Im in the car its the best
"Suggestions that would make this five stars:. 1. Simple: Make it so we can change our playlist covers on mobile.2. Make it so we can open the artist mix and that artists albums again? Im not sure why that was taken away.3. Separate the artists we follow from the personal profiles we follow.4. Make it so non-premium members are able to rearrange the song order of a playlist on mobile.These quick fixes would make the app absolutely brilliant, with or without premium. I highly recommend you heed my advice"
"spotify. i like this app but it has suggested tracks playing in the middle of my playlist and theyre songs that i dont even know much less want to listen to, they should have an option if you want to discover new music or would rather listen to your original playlists"
Dont download waste of time. Why would you add music that I dont like on my playlist and I can listen to music I want you dont put it on shuffle dont add music to my personal playlist until you fix this I will keep this review up you ruined the app no one download it it waste your time
"My app has issues. A day ago I wanted to hear some music to help me relax then it said as if I didnt have data(wifi but I did have wifi, for some reason it didnt let me so I tried to delete it then download it again but now for some reason it doesnt let me"
couldnt play music without using my data or wifi. I couldnt play music without using my data or wifi
Spotify. We are 71 and love Spotify. Use soundtracks our kids make up or just search for selections we like. Play sound tracks from Spotify too. Use mostly with Google Play but also use in the car.  Have playing through phones all the time
"Love this App But. I do pay for the Premium version, but loving music like I do, for the price I get not only the portability, but also the access to a vast variety of titles. There are a few exceptions where I have put the app to the test, and found a few songs that are not available, but again we&#39;re talking of some rare latino titles. However, it annoys me when I already have a track available, and all of a sudden, it gets eliminated. In general, I recommend the app over other music apps I have tried"
"Everything music. Its makes you ur own personal playlistGives u a weekly update on ur most listened songs SOO many amazing podcasts MORE GOOD PLAYLISTS PUSH TO INDIE/TALENTED artist like Ill get recommendations from artist who have less then 100,000 ML and love the song. Ive found MY FAVOURITE artist through Spotifys. Playlist I just live"
"Format. My biggest annoyance is that this app wont transition to a horizontal format. I would also love for it to be more user friendly while driving, I know this works connected to certain vehicles, or esp with android, but I want to be able to switch to a drive mode so I can find and access my music while driving thats safer than having to scroll when I want to listen to something or change a playlist. Oh, I think itd be nice to see folders that Ive made when I share my collection with others. Everything else I love. I use this app for work and personal use all the time so these issues I deal with frequently"
"could have a more social option. i love this app and its super accessible, but im just BEGGING to be able to have chats on it (or on desktop) or be able to sync listening to songs with a friend maybe the option to change usernames, or have a personal isabel profile would be cool. furthermore, the ability to edit playlist covers and descriptions on mobile would be great. thanks"
Love-hate relationship. Loved this app until yall put updates that arent needed thats been causing it become buggy. Like now no matter where I play my liked tracks it always goes back to the top. Plus the music quality is subpar compared to Apple Music. Who needs visuals when youre driving? Nobody stares at their phone that long looking at a repeated loop
"Still more problems. I was listening to my music when Spotify stopped playing music for no reason and then the song restarted again. I thought that is isnt a major problem, but it kept doing it on the same song. This means that this same song is constantly repeating and if I skipped it then it would happen to the next song. This problem has been annoying me for a few days now and the suggested tracks dont stop coming. I turned off auto play to stop the tracks from playing, it didnt work and I am still getting suggested tracks"
"keeps pausing?. spotify has been pausing every song and podcast i stream on here every 30 seconds and it has been getting really frustrating. ive deleted the app and re downloaded twice, ive restarted my phone twice, ive cleared the cache, ive toggled the data saver option. nothing is working. please fix this problem, this is my only music streaming platform i use and id hate to switch after 5+ years"
Video Podcasts is a Waste of Data. Would appreciate it if you allowed us to disable video playback for Podcasts. Dont like seeing 13GB of Data used for streaming Audio Podcasts only to learn that video was streaming in the background too
Data. Way too much data being collected
My personal playlist gone. All the albums I had on my personal lists goneThe new interface is horrible So much more confusing nowCongratulations of ruining what was suppose to be great.People are complaining online but you dont really care
Data Storage Issue. Can you guys just make something to cap the amount of space downloads will take up on my phone? Partitioning drives is f**** elementary

"Offline Musics. Im really disappointed by this new update, before this update I was able to listen to offline music. For example, lets just say Im in Daven Port beach with no data... NO PROBLEM offline musicBUT NOW , I need to have some sort of data to login in to my offline music, which completely makes no sense"
"Podcasts. Not a good app for listening to podcasts. Always downloads video content along with audio which kills your data allocation. Podcasts, for most, are for listening to not for viewing. Also, Bluetooth keeps dropping out and so does playback. It is too much of a pain to have to keep meddling with the phone just to keep listening. All advise offered appears to be for USA users not Australia. Such as options under data saver does not exist on our version. Goodbye JRE. I have listened to you from the very first episode. No longer"
"My opinion, dont let it change yours. Adverts are pointless , only 6 skips  Should make it more like sound cloud minimum of advertising and able to skip more also it works a lot better without data"
Miss info. Stop making money off of toxic liars. Im going to cancel my account if this isnt corrected soon
"GREAT for the most part. The biggest complaint I can make regarding this app is that the UI is getting too user hostile. Mixing music and podcasts onto a single page was a horrible idea. I cant think of a single situation where someone would be flexible with picking between listening to music and listening to podcasts. They are two completely separate types of media??Also, the social element barely exists on the mobile version of the app? Its so nice seeing what your friends are listening to when you are on your laptop/computer. Why cant we have this on the mobile app. The feature is incredible, PLEASE implement it Other than all the complaints, I have been using this platform for almost 5 years and dont plan on switching, unless a competitor really addresses the points above"
Data usage. Uses a lot of data
Play on data. I cant play and choose my songs from any playlist when Im using my data. It just works when I am connected through my Wi-Fi
"Ability to remove recently played. Great app but why did they take away the ability to remove recently played albums/tracks? And why are they so prominent on the home screen?If I play a quick song to calm down my baby siblings, it shouldn&#39;t stay there forever. I should be able to clear it"
Great app but has issues. I love the access to all the music available but when connecting to car the info fails to shows up or is corrupted since the last few updates. Would give 5 stars if that was a fixed
5 ads in a row. Nope Im out you have lost my business Though I will give you that they werent all your own ads reminding me how annoying this app is because you have to pay to listen to actual musicUpdate: I decided to give them another chance.... I got one of their watch this ad and get 30 minutes with no ads I watched the 3 ADS THEY PLAYED then listened to 2 songs(that were not 15 minutes long) and then was put through 5 adsApple Watch app also refuses to use Bluetooth so thanks for messing up my run
Fix your collaborative playlist. Really several threads open with 10s of thousands of votes and your response is Not right now. Im paying 11$ a month just so spammers can spam their music on all my playlists. Imagine your watching Netflix and another user starts modifying your watch and continue watching list
"Needs offline support for Apple Watch. I like Spotify, but I wanna be able to go for a run without my phone and play music from Spotify to my wireless headphones from my Apple Watch. Very disappointed that this feature doesnt seem to be a priority"
"Spotify has been good however. I absolutely love Spotify. Except now for some reason songs sound really messed up and grainy except for a few that I downloaded recently, also I cant load anything even though its all downloaded when Im not on data. Its like all my music files went corrupt and Its really pissing me off. Please fix this or at least help me out so I can keep bumpin the way Im used to"
There is no video off option. I drive for work almost every day and listen to joe rogan with my mobile phone. Now it is exclusive to Spotify so here i am. It works great but there is no option to turn off the video. This is a podcast with no video option. Hello?? . It not only kills my data plan but some areas i cant get signal to finish the file because it is too big Itunes stop showing audio podcasts and now i am here. Please add the no video option
Downloads need data for playback?. Why do my downloaded podcast need a connection to play? Whats the point of them being stored on my phone if they wont play unless connected to a network. I have 3+ Gb of podcast downloaded that refuse to play
"Great app but a lot of ads. Works very well, is free and very easy to use. This app needs WiFi to play songs. Only issue is that there are a lot of ads, and the only way to stop them is to buy premium. You also need premium to download songs to listen offline. If you have data though, then not having premium is perfectly fine"
"Incredible But. I love this app It has many great features1. The playlists to share around with other people You can them as long as you want with any songs you please.2. All the different song choices is great as well, I can find almost every song I want. Sadly it fed the have some which is okay as well3. You can make these storys and make them about anything you want. Which I think is really cool though I dont Listen to them anymore.4. How you can add your own pictures to your playlists, you can sometimes edits other playlists that people made, you can block songs if you dont like them ( this choice is mostly for parents in my opinion.) you also can leave like on other playlists.For the problemThere are many ads. I know you want the money so you put in several ads so people will buy the premium but to be honest, not many people are going to want to especially sense some people come on here to escape the pay for other music apps. I am mostly okay with it but it also plays two 30 second ads which in my opinion is annoying, especially when you are taking a bath and just want to listen to some nice music.I would recommend this app, but unless you dont want to pay for a subscription, prepare for the ads"
"terrible. I just wanted a way to listen to music on the go without using too much data, this app looked like the perfect one because it was free. Im fine with adds and not being able to skip songs but what really made me hate this app is that I adds random songs to my playlist and I cant get rid of them. Also whenever I search for a song their will be a song with the cover sound and name but when I click on it the song isn&#39;t what i&#39;m looking for, its just garbage. Very frustrating, beware buyer"
"Fine but not working with Discord. So Spotify works really well aside from the fact that afte recent updates it refuses to play while I'm in a Discord call-It'll rapidly skip tracks, completely make whatever I'm listening to disappear, or just spazz out in general and kick me out the app"
"suggested tracks. I love spotify and Ive been using it for years, but recently there have been suggested tracks popping up when im listening to my liked songs. This wouldnt be a problem, except that the only way to get back to my liked music is to waste my skips. I just feel like when i want new music ill go find some in my daily mix, or look for it elsewhere on the app, but when I am listening to my l i k e dmusic, i only want to hear the songs i have actually liked, no new suggestions"
"Good but. I cant play individual songs It makes me listen through a whole playlist before I can even put ONE song I want. I dont wanna pay premium for that It adds songs to my personal playlist and it gives me such a bad experience. Like seriously, isnt that over the top? I get that you want to make money and its a business, but it gives me such a bad music experience. Im considering just deleting it"
This app is pay to listen. The app has an add almost every song. It is especially annoying when working out because your song ends in the middle of your set. Garbage app. Also I was in a Clash Royale game and it started lagging. Sure enough the app targeted all my internet to play the stupid little add. It resulted in my loss. If it wasnt for my awesome playlists I would have already deleted this app. As a matter of fact I have unlimited data now so I might just switch to Musi
Best free music app. Just wish you could listen to music outside without data but its amazing and helps you with favourites
In any log-in device. Good apps affirm to any devices its good easy to access in other web or app.easy to find music I disadvantage to this app to add more music at playlist .rate 4 to leave a comment or discussion.
Spotify. Overall it is a very good app. Very good at collecting data and making playlist that you like. One thing I like about it is it will take the songs that you like and collect data and find out what kind of podcast you would like. Its has a vast selection of songs and podcast overall though. The only thing that I dislike is the limited skips and the adds the could do a little better than that but overall its a good app and I would use over pandora any day
"LOVE IT BUT JUST ONE THING. I absolutely love the app. Everything from recommending songs to me, keeping steady playlists for me to listen to, to updating music all the time. I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS One, I would absolutely love it if there was a faster option to add music to your own PERSONAL playlist, as I love to create my own personal playlist for family and friends to listen to. On occasions, I frequently add music in playlists but usually end up being time inefficient. I was wondering if there was a faster way? And 2, for my own personal playlists, I would like to separate it from other playlists I follow from &gt;Playlists &gt;Music &gt;Playlists. If possible, I would highly recommend having playlists you follow in a separate category and having your own personal playlists in their own category. That way itll be way more organized on keeping a clean plate if that makes sense. Thanks"
Video playback for some plays list wastes data. No way to disable video playback
Disappointed with off line problem. Its doesnt play song from downloaded without using mobile data. Very disappointed with this
"Was great, became something terrible. Spotify used to be great, but now all they do is push podcasts and display ads to paid users. I was also very unhappy with the number of Spotify tracking cookies and other tracking technology used. I didnt expect my creepy DJ to follow me around the web, but it seems thats what Spotify does. No wonder they have such good recommendations, I guess. Spotify went from being something I looked forward to as part of my day to something I wont give another chance to"
"please fix the collaborative playlist. okay so this app is good for me to make playlists with my significant other. we have had a collaborative playlist that was started 6 months ago and it serves as a comfort playlist. however lately we have had people finding the playlist and adding random songs that add up to hundreds upon hundreds of hours of songs we have to take the time to remove. this is becoming a huge hassle and both will cancel our premium subscription if this issue persists. it cannot be that hard to select profiles that you can collaborate with, so that no strangers can add onto them. just for a bit if privacy please fix this.UPDATE i am changing it to one star as someone deleted all the songs from the playlist. absolutely ridiculous. we arent paying money for no customer service and no one cares about our issues on your community tab"
10 years of song history gone. Went to reset my password and all my song data got deleted. Something to do with apple login.. please help
Have people answer your phones. I have another account that I can not remember my log info and Im getting charged each month for it. So I tried calling your company about it and I guess you guys are to cheap to have anyone answer your phones. So a automated person answers sending you to a useless website
"Deletes library. App constantly deletes tunes Ive downloaded already. Forces me to use data all the time when Im driving. Completely defeats the purpose of trying to save music o listen to frequently. I dont care about the playlists, theyre all bad, I dont care about suggestions, theyre never good. Just let me listen to what Ive downloaded, I pay for the app"
"STOP IT. Spoti-Flipn-Fy PLEASE STOP PROMPTING ME TO CHOOSE??? I faithfully pay you 10Bucks a month for commercial free, market free, tracking free platform If I am in Control, then Dangit Respect the Payment you get from me In order for me to close the Dang window, I must click the Choose button or close and reopen the dog-gone app. JUST STOP IT"
"the problem. cool app except for the part where you harvest my data, you snakes. Also recommendations and radios based off songs used to be better"
Covid information warnings. Get rid of covid information warnings
"Apple Watch app. I LOVE Spotify, but when I got my Apple Watch and downloaded the app, I was VERY disappointed that any of my Bluetooth earbuds didnt show up as an option for devices. I know Im not the only one who has this problem"
Love the app hate that is doesnt play through smart watch. You really need to update the software for mobile data enabled devices to work with the app. Being a remote isnt enough
"Spotify is the Best. Incredible, I love using this app so much"
Doesnt support Tune2air Bluetooth anymore. Im a Uber driver and I use Spotify 8-12 hours a day When I connect it to my car I could see the song titles and artist information With a recent new update I cannot see any of that details. Song keeps playing but track information doesnt show up
Data. I like it a lot but I wish it didnt coast data
Here till the money runs out. Dont pay in full for a year membership after reading the reviews and having about 95% of the problems of other users its not a safe steaming service anymore.It would be good if they can fix it but its going on too long now and on changes PLEASE LOOK At WHAT THEY are selling off of yours when you pay them MONEY so so wrong.That means the information they collect and sell to a third party
"Amazing. It is amazing just on its own, but you do have to listen to a short-ish ad every once in a while. This is great, I get to listen to all my favorites, including podcasts. I would recommend premium to anybody always on the road, because then you dont have ads, and you can download songs so you dont use data. All in all, Spotify is great, and would definitely recommend to download the app"
"Feedback. The ads are SO ANNOYING I dont have the money to waste on that. Also, it takes up too much data"
Need to include being able to play a song on demand without paying. The other stuff that only comes with free I understand. Also should have the option to play in cellular without WiFi if you have the means and data to do so
"Glitchy last several times. On several occasions, my app will stop playing music and close itself on my phone. Im using cell data to stream when this happens. I like finding playlists people create, this is perhaps my favorite feature. Until the glitchiness is fixed Ill be using Amazon music"
This app is AWESOME NO REGRETS. This app is amazing soo good so fun they have hundreds of thousands of your fav songs this app has a great u wont look back there will be no regrets downloading this app is my favourite app on my phone and probably the number One it the world this app is a MUST download this app is also 100% FREE with Spotify you can follow your friends and music artist and people can follow you unless you make your acoustic private with this app u can like long by pressing the heart next to the song with this app you can also make playlists that u can make public (everyone can listen) or private (only u can listen) so you will have NO REGRETS DOWNLOADING THIS APP
"Great library, bad data management. Was thinking 3-4 stars recently, but they removed the option to disallow playlist downloading over cellular data without any warning or replacement. Meanwhile they still havent fixed the issue where already-downloaded daily mixes always expire on the next day, even if they havent been listened to and/or offline mode is engaged.And they still have issues with making it clear whether or not all selected dailies have downloaded. Put it all together and it gets really easy to leave home thinking that youre ready to listen to any of your dailies without spending data, only to either discover that you have almost none of them or inadvertently spend a bunch of data on lists you thought were already downloaded"
"App. This app is so good It lets me play all of my favorite songs, and its so easy to make personal playlists"
No Apple Watch streaming. I love this app except that it it doesnt have streaming option for the Apple Watch that was the main reason I bought an Apple Watch. No offline or data streaming compatibility ... I now use Pandora because they have offline listening on their app. Step it up Spotify
"Bad changes. Unsure who gave the green light to these changes, but heres two glaring issues:1. Even if youre trying to reference offline music, the app attempts first to connect to the internet. Thats a problem if youre on a bad connection or on an airplane where the WiFi is being silly. Instead, a great development team would have it attempt to reference offline app data first and then reference online data next for a better UX.2. Recently played is now a side scrolling function that is entirely dependent on the app being online. So, not only is it bad UX for side scrolling and moving it to the home screen, it is bad UX due to already stated #1. Also recently played is 100% depend on an internet connection now. What the hell is the point of premium if these clowns cant allow me to see even basic functions in offline?"
"App crashes and plays ads relentlessly. I use this app daily and it crashes several times per day. It does not matter if I am on wifi, or cell data, I have data saver turned on. It will be working fine and then stop and when I open it back up again I have to listen to 3-4 ads before it will play a song. It plays about 3 songs then crashes and I have to listen to 3-4 ads again even if I just watched a video for 30 min of ad free listening. I have an Iphone xr and ios and the spotify app are all up to date"
Love music hate the beliefs. So I loooove the music the country music on here is awesome but all the pride and LGBTQ+ gag me if they could stop putting that stuff on here if they could just make it around music nothing political nothing personal just MUSIC That would be great. Other than that its really good
Its.. okay. Omg this app is killing me . Im telling you it wasnt as bad but now like the ads are non stop . Its so annoying. Btw nobody wants the Playing Suggested Track/album Thats also annoying too. And 6 skips? I mean I was okay with that for a while but I mean its kinda a small amount. I mean I still prefer this over pandora but this stuff gets annoying and I hate when  it keeps stopping
"So simple. Brilliant, easy to use. Just to say I appreciate your new data base User friendly"
My personal music buddy. I wish I can get it for free
"Great App, Not so great profit sharing. App is great. Easy to use. Doesnt take up too much data. Makes it easy to listen to music you like, find new music and more. I rated 3 stars due to Spotifys business model and how little profit it shares with artists. Other companies like Bandcamp do a much better job at supporting all members, not just generating huge money for the megastars on the platform"
"Free version isnt super great. I remember when this app was free to use. of course, theres nothing wrong with separating that with a premium feature. but theres such a huge jump between the free trial and the free version. I have no problem with 30 seconds ads, but i feel like it takes up most of my time. even when i get thirty minutes uninterrupted, which is nice, im bothered that i cant skip more than a few songs, change my own personal playlist, or even choose which song i want to listen to. the free version makes it really hard to listen to a music app ive always liked. If Ihad the money to buy it monthly i would. its just dissapointing. 3/10 with free version. wouldnt recommend"
Star rating. Star rating should be added where your highest personal rating on a song gets added to a playlist
"ADD LYRICS TO THE SONGS. I love the your app, I have been using it for years. I think that the several playlists for the different genres or occasions are awesome as well as the recommended songs according to your personal playlists. One thing that I would absolutely love to see and I think would make the app a lot better would add lyrics to the song thats being played on the screen"
Love this app. Have had this app for over 4 years. Its great for keeping track of the music you love and putting you on to something new
"Its pretty good but. I dont know if this is just me but I listen on two different devices, a tablet and my iPhone. I use the same account on both of them, but for some reason it dosent really share information so when I go on with my phone i see what I was listening to last time I used my phone, not just the last thing I listened to, and it gets pretty annoying so help please mabey?"
Downloads. Literally has one job: play downloaded music offline. Literally have cellular data right now to write this review and still cant play music... $10 a month btw
"Some dope vibes. I just love Spotify, its so much better than any other music service out there and you get exclusive Twenty Øne Piløts tracks."
"Doesnt play downloaded music. I download playlist to avoid using excess data, but it doesnt play any songs unless Im using 3G or Wifi.. which defeats the purpose and of downloading songs to olay them while Im out running errands. It forces me to turn the data on"
"Not playing. So I normally love Spotify, but recently it has been glitching and if I dont have a good internet connection or wifi, nothing will play. I have premium and I have my playlists downloaded but even then, nothing will play. Ive tried turning on offline mode, turning on and off wifi, data, airplane mode, closing the app and restarting, but nothing works. This has made it very difficult to be able to actually use the app and its very frustrating"
Needs improvment. 1. Maybe we can allow an unlimited song limit for a personal library?2.  Some artists I try to follow do not stay following.3.  I can no longer change the order of songs for a random shuffle?
"Account deleted. I was listening to music in my car and when I got home and got back on wifi (I dont have on data for Spotify on my phone) I was logged out of my account. I tried logging back in and it prompts me to create a whole new account, even though the app still has the saved songs in its memory. Saw a Reddit thread and apparently this has happened to a few others in a short span of time. Please fix, this was a premium account"
Lost my password info. Had my account logged in but it kicked my out and wants me to put in my info when I had my phone attached to my account. Trash company whats the point in enabling 2fa if youre just gonna remove my account now I cant even login and dont know if I want to make a new account
"Its ok. I bought the premium and when I leave and dont want to turn on my data .I would like to use the offline mode but it doesnt play all the songs that download ,thats crazy"
1 star. This app used to be good but now is trash. Now you cant skips songs (its now 6 skips a hour) and they add songs to your personal playlist
"Love it but. This is a great app, but I really wish there was a feature that allowed you to add your own personal description to each song on a playlist"
. This app is so stupid I dont know whats wrong with the makers The only this is good in this app is song qualityWhy the makers make the simple features like play music play liked track so complexI am very disappointed I will never pay for this app
"Nice but could be better. Great service, but remote feature is annoying as it constantly drops out if you listen to a single song from your libary and the music stops then you have to reconnect the remote function to get it working again, major pain in the bum is the scroll feature a little bump on it and it jumps though your list then you have to go track by track to find were you were, now just needs proper streams full 44.1khz 16 bit and not at stupid tidal prices"
"App borders on unusable. The app wont play music, or let me see what Ive downloaded, if it isnt actively connected to the internet/servers. I have background data on, cellular use on, but it will just stop connecting, and leaves me with a bricked app. I have to turn airplane mode on and off to reconnect. This happens frequently when Im driving, especially in mountains. Defeats the purpose of playing downloaded music if I have to connect to the internet to hear it. On top of this, the algorithm makes extremely poor choices, and recommends a ton of music I actively dont like. Thoroughly disappointed in my paid subscription"
"Best music app of all time. They make personal playlist for you, thats all i gotta say"
I love it. You can download the songs so that you can listen to your songs if you dont have data
"Crash fix needed. Ive been a long time listener to Spotify. I have it on all my devices. But for my phone and google home mini the songs will pause and will refuse to play without anyone touching it, it will play twenty ads or so and then stop working freezing, or just down right crashing, I cant even listen to five songs without it having some problem. It works on my laptop but not on the other two devices. Please work on this. I have no clue why its doing this. I will edit this review if things change for better or worse. (Running 14.2 IOS and 8.6.20 for the Spotify app on the phone. Dont know the other devices info)"
"Bugs?. My Spotify keeps crashing after about 2 minutes of being open? Dont know why and has never done it before, Ive tried turning my phone off and back on and checked for updates, also Ive got premium but most of my songs I have downloaded wont play unless Ive got my data on or am connected to wifi... whats going on?"
"The worlds music at your fingertips. It still amazes me that we can listen to virtually any music at the tap of a finger. I also love the algorithmic DJ which has introduced me to music and artists Id never have otherwise come across. The Daily Mix is a great feature. Pleased to note that the app still lets you play an entire album without shunting you off into listening to promoted tracks.A couple of serious reservations: 1) the composers or performing artists only get a tiny fraction of the revenue streaming generates, i.e. a few pence per month unless they are heavily promoted. If you listen to LArpeggiata exclusively all month, most of the small fraction of your monthly subscription allocated to the content creators will go to a handful of heavily promoted artists and your favourite group will still get next to nothing. A user-centric model of revenue distribution would go some way to addressing this.2) what about the old CD booklets crammed with info? Thats the next thing streaming could fix for a wide variety of genres.We want to know the story behind the music and we want to know whos playing each track - theres a lot of work to do, especially for classical music"
Incredible app. I started using Spotify way back in 2014 its super easy to use and the algorithm for music is great it somehow will always play music with the same vibe on shuffle I liked it so much I even bought the full version its a fantastic app wayyy better than Apple Music
"Amazing. Ive had Spotify for around 2 years and its amazing. Definitely worth the $10 a month for premium. No adds, create your playlist, download music so you dont have to use data or WiFi. You can also search for your friends playlist and Spotify gives you daily mixes based off of what you listen to"
"Remove follower option?. The privacy of this app severely lacks. The option to remove followers for subscribing users needs to be added. Thousands of your users are requesting this feature. I have searched countless forums trying to figure out how to delete people or block users, there are no solutions available online"
Low Data Mode Failure. Used 2gb of data in 25 minutes even when on low data mode. Good thing I was paying attention. Used to be a great app when low data mode actually worked. Way to kill my data plan
Playlist. Ill be listening to a playlist of my personal music that I like listening to and other songs that I dont like and that arent on my playlist will come on please fix that :) and sometimes to even get back to my playlist I have to skip a few songs or completely restart the app
"Hacked. This app has been great for me, but recently someone has figured out how to get into my account, and although I have no personal information on this app, its still frustrating when I now can never listen to music. If theres some way to get rid of these outside devices that somehow found their way into my account, let me know, cause nothing I have tried to do has worked, and Im getting annoyed"
"App keeps crashing. In terms of being able to use the app, it keeps crashing It is SO ANNOYING. it has happened MULTIPLE times. I have removed all other background apps, made sure the Spotify app is up to date, I have great cellular data service, and my iOS is up to date It is quite frustrating, PLEASE fix this"
"Really?. Okay, I use this app a lot, yet I cant skip songs in a track? I have to buy premium? Thats literally stupid. Thats the biggest mistake Ive seen a music app make. Other than this; its great. Its just this is so annoying and frustrating to me. Im honestly very disappointed. I might go back to using SoundCloud even :/"
Love it. its great and I can use it wherever with data theres just a lot of adds
Ad free listening. I love the music selection and personal made playlists but when it comes up with an extra long ad that says listen to this ad and get 30 min ad free listening it rarely works which honestly frustrates me worse than if they didnt offer it at all. Usually you watch the ad listen to a song and then it turns around and immediately plays 3 more ads
Great but. This app is great i use it on a daily basis. But theres something i wanna talk about. when you dont have premium why do you just add random songs to my playlists or played suggested tracks i wanna listen to the album i picked. not whats on the radio for it. thats all bye 
". Overall its good but I do have some problems, for example I watch a video to get 30 minutes without ads but if I leave the app and than come (back during the 30 minutes) but I still get commercials? Like you remember where my song left of but not that I watched an ad? Sometimes when Im listening and my phones turned off, out of no where it stops and I have to go into the app and click start Im not sure if this is a personal problem but I know this happens on my dads phone too, so? This is starting to happens regularly too so its getting annoying . Overall good music and some songs they recommend than become"
"Very easy to understand. Very easy to navigate app with a ton of cool features including the equalizer, low data mode and the fact that you can download songs wasnt sure at first because i switched over from apple music but this is way better love the app, continue the great updates and constant support"
"STOP SUGGESTED TRACKS. This app is excellent; it gives me easy access to music and I love that Im able to make my own playlists. If you dont want to pay for music, the ads accompanying the free version are a small price to pay for this amazing app However, it is EXTREMELY irritating when the suggested tracks start playing. There is a reason I am listening to a playlist; to listen to the music that I have chosen to be in it When I am listening to my selected music, I absolutely DO NOT want to listen to some random song. I tried turning auto play off, but it did not work for me. I would suggest to the app makers to make sure that if I turn auto ply off that the app actually honors my request. Other than that, this app is amazing :)"
Please helppppl. It wont let me download it after I deleted the app everyone I try but it wasnt billing information please fix this I dont have premium
Review. It is to good better then anything else but how do you down load songs so they dont waste data
"Wifi. Works perfectly with data but it crashes with wifi, its been doing it for a long time. I even emailed the Spotify help and they didnt help"
Is it worth buying premium?. Worth paying for premium I use it everyday and dont have to worry about wasting mobile data
"Could be better. This app is pretty darn good, but needs a way to turn off the video for podcast like joe rogan to save on data"
"I want my data?. Ironically, for the amount that apps track they claim to not have any music data past 6 months. One of the most precious things about music is hearing a song for the first time and attaching it to a time or place. I want to know when that was. I want to know which summers day was spent discovering that artist or listening to the same song shamelessly on repeat. Alas"
"The best music app ever. And I never write reviews. Honestly though, 5 stars for aesthetics &amp; functionality. However, still waiting on being able to block other users. I noticed the competition has this feature. Music can be personal, private. And life changes. We should have the option to choose who views our playlists. Lee can go elsewhere to get his fix of smooth jams"
"Loved it but-. Love the app Its got all the music I need The fact that you now have to get premium just to skip a song is kind of in my face screaming that you want money. Not only that, but you wont let us replay the song with the button, or find a single song to listen to, we have to listen to the whole track, which, yet again, screams that you want money. I enjoyed the app while it lasted, I deleted Pandora for this app. Hope everyone enjoys Its a great app, really It just needs to stop with the premium"
music download. sometimes my download playlist wont be downloaded when i dont have internet so i have to turn my data on then it says it download then i turn it off and then its downloaded
"I HATE THE UPDATE. The latest update is horrible to me. I am not interested in videos playing whilst I just want to listen to music. Shouldnt I be able to decide whether I want that feature or not? Was how data consuming this update is taken into consideration? This update just slows down my listening to music. Tracks keep pausing because of buffering tchwww -.-Is it possible to reverse the update? If yes, please let me know how"
annoying. dumb ads are so annoying only good if u buy premium. also stop playing suggested track with the worse songs ever and let me continue listening to my liked songs smh
"Playlist Photos. Hi, I love making new playlists for my different types of music, however, I dont enjoy looking at the covers of the four albums I have as the first four songs in the playlist. I want to have personal photos as the cover. I know you can do this on a desktop or whatever, but it should be much more accessible to people on mobile devices. If you could make so you change them over the app, that would be great Thanks"
"Beyond amazing. This app is actually amazing, you can use it like everywhere and it uses like hardly any data"
"Buggy update. Lowering to 1 star. Even when I select to download a podcast with audio only it still has video. I dont want video  When I have the navigation running and listening to Spotify at the same time...every time the navigation gives a direction it pauses Spotify and you have to go into Spotify and hit play....every single time. Also, why does video not have an option to turn off or only play on WiFi. Your killing my data. I am trying the free trial but these issues make me not want to continue with the premium package. Second update. I figured out how to download a audio only podcast. Simple fix to not play video is just turn on airplane mode otherwise it tries to play video and then will buffer and use all your data. Not a solution by any means. Pretty sure Spotify wants to inflate their stats saying everyone is viewing the video file so they can sell ads. The most basic podcast app has figured this out so clearly Spotify has an agenda here. Cant wait til the JRE contract is up. Second update. If you leave a podcast and return later to listen it loses your place. The most basic feature a 10 year old could code. Forums show this has been an issue for years"
Good but could be better. 1.  Would like more data fields. 2.  Would like better access to my own data. 3.  Artist Radio AI not as good as Apple Genius function on my old iPod. Not enough deep tracks. 4.  No HD tier
"Very hard to use without premium. Without unlimited skips is very hard cause I have a lot of songs in my playlist and sometimes I dont want that style so I skip and then no more skips until an hour, also its very hard to add songs to a playlist, in other apps I like them and it adds it and this just shows you a preview and I cant play them so I have to go into the little sub menus and add it to a playlist, last the ads are terrible, I understand thought they have to make money somehow and this app is free. But I dont really care about offline listening but it would be nice if it was a free feature to not use cellular data. Other than that the app is great its just those issues that irritate me so much thats why I give it a 2 stars"
Doesnt work on Apple Watch on its own. I have subscribed for a premium account and subscribed for additional data connection to my Apple Watch but Spotify cannot be played if your watch is not connected to iPhone via Bluetooth...will have to continue going for a run or gym with my iphone..annoying
"Love it, but. listen, spotify is AMAZING with premium. thankfully premium isnt TOO awful expensive... either way recently (last 6 months...ish) ive been experiencing this bug? where i cant queue songs if theyre not in a playlist. not even downloaded, just in a playlist. i have to undownload the app to fix it. and then after awhile, it goes back to it. i checked my wifi, my data, etc. its just the app. ill queue a song and once it goes it play it it just stops. everything stops playing. i have to restart a playlist and the rest of the queue will be just as it was before. is there a reason? this is really annoying"
Review. Let me skip more songs and play any song from my playlist instead of having to start at the one I last listened to. You already use all my data. At least let me enjoy you. Id rather use Musi
Very useful. Highly recommend going premium as you can download playlist to avoid using data and change the sound to your preferred preference
Love the app. Please make it possible for my to download my music onto my Apple Watch
"Asi. The free version was fine before, recently you have to lessen 3 long adverts between any single track "
Ads. I personal dont like ads I think there annoying but I wanted to ask for like every month or something a day or you know what I mean without ads I think that would be really cool and thoughtful you dont have to but just a question please and thanks love this app
"Buggy update. Lowering to 1 star. Even when I select to download a podcast with audio only it still has video.

"A must have. Spotify is amazing the music quality, to the easy set out I always and I mean always Use Spotify over all Perfect for kids traveling too With the fact you can download so u can play the songs off data  End of story it is absolutely amazing"
New update. I hate it I add songs to my personal play list and instead I turn it on and it plays songs I havent I regret updating it really bad do NOT recommend
"Just some feedback. My app is constantly re-downloading my songs every day, every time my phone dies and it leaves me without any downloaded songs at times. Which is frustrating because I travel a lot and im not always at home to have it use my wifi. Is this just me or does everyones liked songs and personal playlists have to re-download so frequently? I want to be able to understand why this is happening, I figure they should just be downloaded once and then the songs are on there for good. Leaves me wondering why I pay for this service"
Title. It stops way to much when I using data
Lost everything. My credit card got hacked and so I got a new on not remember exactly what came out of the card I forgot to update the info when when I logged on to do it and had to log out and back into the app all my play lists were deleted even those I downloaded looking into another music app after that
A download should be a download. I download a album using my WiFi only to discover it is not downloaded when Im outside of my WIFi area. I dont want to download using my mobile data cause it eats into my allowance. Im a premium subscriber
Forced to download video. Its become hard to listen to Joe Rogan without going over my data usage since Im forced to download with video. Its honestly pretty terrible
"The Future is now. I love the app, especially now Im able to drag tracks in a playlist to change to order. I really enjoy the offline mode for my walk to work and being able to access my playlists from all my devices. This old muso is even considering selling his vinyl "
LOVE IT HERE. Spotify is the best platform for music. I can create playlists or put on a favorite song and itll pick up on its own from there. Whether its an old school track or a brand new one that I didnt even know I needed to hear. I recommend it for everyone
Ties to China. Stopped using because a part of their stocks is held by ten cent a notorious Chinese company stealing Americans data. beware
"Inability to music directly on iWatch. Would really appreciate if key tracks/playlists can be downloaded and played straight from my I watch, like other apps &amp; podcasts"
"Lyrics . Awesome app, Thank you, Spotify teamWould be insane if you add lyrics if not for all songs but at least to certain categories (e.g. top downloaded tracks, those in charts, etc.). Keep up great work - its much appreciated"
Personal playlist. Cant work out how to get them to show up on Portal. Great fun making it. But? Where is it?
"Worst f-ing app. It keeps playing tracks that I have disliked, I will be deleting this f ing app now"
"Some recommendations. Firstly, it would be good to have more choice on liking songs. When making personal playlists it would be better to have categories for like and then favourite or really like. iTunes has a five point grading system and that makes it easier to pick songs for playlists. Secondly, when a playlist is on random play its better not to have consecutive songs from the same artist - it should jump more. Thirdly, I would be prepared sometimes to pay extra to an artist I like. So could that payment option be built in?Otherwise thanks for an excellent service"
I mean. I get that I dont have premium but The ads are after every single song and its not just one its like 4 and if I watch a video for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music it doesnt work as Im i get an add again in like 10 minutes other than that the app is absolutely incredible
Good but one suggestion. I just would like there to be an offline mode because sometimes when Im on the bus it doesnt let me listen to music. And I would like a short data mode
"Great for Music Terrible for Podcasts. Love Spotify for music and music suggestions. But there is a huge miss with podcasts. The fact that I have to manually download new episodes of the shows I follow to listen without wasting data is ridiculous. Apple podcasts will automatically download new episodes of shows you follow, and delete the show once youve listened, this helps save mobile data so Im not constantly streaming episodes when Im on the go (all day).If you have unlimited data it wont be an issue, but I dont have time to download every new show so I can listen to them without wasting my data.I dont like to leave negative reviews but Spotify has great original/ exclusive podcasts. I never listen to them because I would have to download new episodes manually every time theyre released. I just want to be able to download new episodes to my device automatically once there added to Spotify"
Disappointed. What can you say about a platform knowingly disseminates false and misleading information
Crashes. It constantly crashes even after you power off your phone multiple times. Free version is unusable with ADs and whatnot. Premium is OK but still crashes (after about 10 stability fixes might I add) It seems like the company is more focused on selling data then improving their app. Don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s rated 5 stars
"Good. The wide selection is pretty incredible but a lot of misinformation is given sometimes. I know this a streaming platform but me and many musicians I know who spend a lot of time researching and listening to music would benefit a lot from added information such as personnel, labels, recording dates, etc"
"Technical issues. Music keeps pausing. Went online for assistance and tried all suggestions. Log out of all, rebooting, battery stuff, turn info off my phone etc. Possible that someone else has hacked my account but customer service seems difficult and inefficient.Used to be a more reliable service that was worth the monthly cost.Super annoying and cost per month continues to rise. Might be back but am off to try a different streaming service"
"No data, no dice. Having issues with trying to play downloaded episodes of podcasts. Sometimes I can. MOST times I cant"
"my downloaded music wont play. i have a playlist of 800+ songs that i downloaded so i could listen to it while in the car without using data, this however was not the case because it wouldnt let me play any music unless i had data or wifi"
Podcast videos. The podcast videos eat up too much data and stream/play whether you have them pulled up or not. Data eating hog
"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. used to be the best app for music, until they updated it and now its impossible to log in and Ive lost access to all my music "
Pandora is better. The only reason I use this app Is because I am too cheap to have Apple Music but man yall are so uncool only give us six skips an hour what is wrong with you And I dont want to hear the suggested track I dont so maybe fix those problems
The dislike button needs to come back. Ever since you removed the dislike button my release radar has been getting worse. I dont understand why I cant dislike songs on my own personal playlist that no one else sees
"The adds ruin the app. This was a great app for the first week, because i got to try premium. But once that ended the app became a mosh pit of adds. There same adds play over and over again and it really gets on my nerves. I looked at the premium subscription but it is ten dollars a month That is way to much for music. I would consider going premium for five dollars a month. I am probably going to delete the app and go back to amazon music, which does not have adds and lets me skip as much as i want. And oh how i hate only having six skips an hour. It is very annoying and another reason im going to delete this app. To anyone who reads all of this, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. And i forgot to mention it takes up so much data and i all the precious data i have. There are very few good things about this app"
Music without data or wifi. It would be cool if we could still here the songs without any internet connection
"Amazing, you need it now. Its amazing for when ever you want to  just be in the car and enjoy music and even though that it uses a lot of my data it MUCH MUCH better then Apple Music for sureAnd creating your own playlist is so much easier (Im my experience) then Apple Music Hope that you also agree and give it a go some time soon its AMAZING"
"Shit for podcasts. I downloaded Spotify to listen to LPotL and omg this app is terrible The basic Apple podcasts app is better No way to auto collate new podcasts, continually money grubbing, constantly trying to connect to the internet even when listening to downloaded episodes wasting my data. Greedy, poorly designed and podcast functionality tacked on like an unwanted romance in an action movie"
Player is spyware. Wont play if the branch.io tracker is blocked. Ill just stop paying for this service if youre that invasive with your data collection
"8.5.56 not working (Edit: working fine now). Edit (9-30-20): Just got a toast asking to rate, Ive already rated before, but now that they&#39;re asking, current version will stop playing songs after a couple seconds. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Updates show no useful info, specify what&#39;s being changed. How about merging back station function instead of having to use two apps.Edit (5-9-20): No more issues since first editEdit: (1 minute after submitting) And it&#39;s working again.Title says it, was playing fine then just stopped. Tried to close app, restarted phone, nothing works. Turned off data and the app will stay open, turn it back on and the app closes. iphone x, ios 13.4. Spotify stations is working, but I&#39;m paying for the service for this app"
Dumb idea. This is a great app One thing I don&#39;t like is how it keeps interrupting my playlist with a &#39;Suggested Track&#39; and I can&#39;t stop it. Could you add an option to remove that in the free version?
"Playlists are curated by super humans. The playlists for any occasion provide just perfect music, track after track"
Stupid. I bought premium just so I can listen to music offline. But when I open the app it says connect to wifi or data and i cant even get past it to get to my downloaded playlist. Ripoff
"Waste of Time. Aside from the interface issues I have with Spotifys app, I still give them One Star. I only use Spotify for podcasts. With that said I spend a lot of time at home connected to WiFi downloading the podcasts. I do this so I can listen to them at work offline and not use all of my data when not connected WiFi. After all that time downloading them, when I go to listen to them offline 95% of the time it says my library is empty. Sometimes they are there, but very rarely. I go to download them again and there they are, downloaded and ready to be listened to. There are some issues with this app, and this is a big one. It hinders anyone from even using it for offline. Disappointed"
"Stop asking for freebies. Why are people complaining about the ads or lack of custom features?  You have a choice: 1)pay premium, get no ads, ability to sort and all sorts of extra settings. 2) free, and watch ads, limited features3) free, no ads means you are paying with your personal data (e.g. google)Program design is expensive. So is support.  Why does this generation expect everything to be free?"
"Pictures on Playlists. The app is amazing but theres no point in having to go on a computer to put pictures on your playlists when you could just put a picture on through your phone, contemplating switching to Apple Music just for this sole reason, major inconvenience"
"Functional and smooth. Could have much improved personal playlist creation though, this is often lacking, and considering the data companies have on us these days"
Crashing and making my phone hot. For some reason the last couple days Spotify has been crashing multiple times a day and instantly making my phone hot as soon as I open it and start listening to anything. It doesnt matter if its something downloaded or streamed. Or even if Im connected to WiFi or using cell data or even if my cell data is turned off. It crashes and burns my phone. FIX THIS PLEASE

"Let me choose my song. I made a playlist of songs I WANT to listen to, not whatever bull crap you decide I might like. Im not paying to listen to music thats free on YouTube, or Pandora. I dont suggest downloading this. The squid brains dont know what actual music is I dont wanna listen to Johnathan Geoff singing something random. I wanna listen to him singing as King George. And yes I did add more than 15 songs, they added to MY PERSONAL playlist anyways. If they fix this I will download it again"
"What? No way. This is awesome Had I found this app before, I would have not spent so much on iTunes. Love this app Everything I want and more. Helps select songs, all from what I like..and I can create my personal play list "
"Issues with streaming playlists. Whenever I try to use my playlists, it tends to  start playing suggested tracks and I cant stop them?? Like I already picked my music, and when its a louder, more up beat song then the playlist, it destroys the point of a sleep timer"
"Too much data got it glitched up. Get a strong developer team if you want to go harder creatively. There is a lot of data going on like art canvas, lyrics and all that. It can be possible but it has become a whole glitch problem. This is the future of music so keep up. "
Its good. You should be able to listen to music with no internet and wasting data
"Grr. I love the free music, EXCEPT They randomly added a song to my personal playlist that Im TOTALY NOT OKAY WITH Plus they dont let me skip anything so I cant. Just skip it I for some reason cant delete it either ANNNNND Uggghh ITS SO ANNOYING"
"Playlists have a lot of work. Needs a way to sort playlists, both personal and the ones you follow, the way youd like to hear them. Currently you can edit personal ones by dragging songs into what order you want but thats a lot of work when youve made a list of 100 songs or more. Need a way just to sort by recently added or most played and youd have a 5 star app. Currently the playlists, which I feel most people want music apps for, make it quite difficult to enjoy the app"
Good but annoying sometimes. Good because I can make playlists and listen to them without premium unlike Pandora where you have to do a free trial every time you want to make a playlist/ listen to it. But every now and then it plays suggested tracks which is annoying because I dont want to listen to them and I always get a bunch of ads and a lot of the time they repeat over and over so many times . If they could fix both things that would be great. I also tried logging in on my tv and it wouldnt let me even though I used the exact login.. so if they could fix all that Id definitely put aHigher rating
Awful. You can get the same thing but better when you try and play a song it sometimes takes you to a suggestion track that you cant get out of and its so annoying Im going to switch to Pandora its a pretty good app
"Downloads keep deleting. Im about to deploy and have been trying to download music for when I wont have service. Im aware that if you dont connect to data or WiFi after a month your downloads will slowly go away but, everyday all my downloaded music gets deleting now Im 2 days from leaving and have no downloaded music. Its beyond disappointing and stressful"
"Frustrating, No Free Choice. It plays nothing but suggested tracks. I pick a playlist or artist, I press play, and it refuses to play me anything thats actually on the playlist. I skip the track, and it just plays another suggested one. I am unbelievably frustrated as I can no longer hear anything I actually want to listen to. I feel like my choice and free will as a user is completely missing. It sucks"
"The application closes itself when I activate my data. The application closes by itself when I activate my data, I do not understand why this happens, I need help, thank you very much"
Eh. I like this streaming service but STOP PLAYING SUGGEST TRACKS I SWEAR TO GOD IM SO SICK OF IT I DONT WANT TO LISTEN TO A SUGGESTED TRACK I WANT MY MUSIC
"Love it. The king of streaming music, the queen of online auditory satisfaction. So well integrated into just about any requirement in this day and age. Links seamlessly to my headphones, my car, Alexa, my smart TV, etc. But most importantly, it&#39;s all about the music. Almost every song, artist and album can be found, as well as suggestions for something new. Only criticisms are the Discover playlist algorithm which can get stuck in one genre endlessly with no method of resetting. And it would be nice to have one playlist on the free app, even with a max of say 15-20 songs, ads at the end if the list. But both are minor. The app probably grabs data but in the era of horrid social media, trolling and online abuse, just keeps it about the music. Free app has ads but nothing good ever came gratis, totally worth premium though. Get this app"
"Great But a Few Issues. I think this app is great. However one suggestion, I would make it so you can listen offline for free. Everyday, when we arent in lockdown , I have a long bus journey, but if I use data for it then I run out so I would like to be able to listen offline for free. If you did that you would probably also get a lot more downloads. I dont mind ads that much, so Im ok with having to pay for no ads, but not offline"
Literally just want a track history feature. Its almost a perfect experience but I hate that you cannot see a full history of songs or albums ive listened to and the search history is so short. If you can give us a search or song history page that would complete the app honestly
"Glitches. Good that it integrates with the  laptop  app so that you can change which device controls the playing.  Recently my iPhone app refuses to play tracks - I then have to like it and it instantly plays. Id use Spotify much more at night if it had an integrated sleep function, like BBC Sounds and Audible. The often suggested fix of using the stop playing feature in the iPhone timer isnt suitable as the timer then fails to play a sound when you next use it for normal timing - have been caught out several times by that"
Good but too many tech issues. Annoying how when you step out of wifi to data (e.g leaving the house with head phones in ) it doesnt allow you to do that without interrupting the music thats playing . And bit expensive
"New Update?. I dont know what happened, but something changed and now personal playlists can only be played in a shuffle mode. Thats dumb and should be an option. Other than that, Im mostly rating it one star so this problem is fixed. Then Id rate it 5 stars"
"Its good but. I literally cant do features mentioned everywhere else that other people can. I cant upload photos to playlists, ive reinstalled, ive wiped all data from my cache and from my phone itself, etc. and it just wont work"
"Missing basic functionality. Its actually frustrating that the basic functions of the PC or Kindle app are missing here. Whether playing a playlist or an album, why is there no option to start play on a specific track? Actually if I decide to play an album it turns out to be a playlist for the artist. I dont want a playlist. Play that specific album only. I can do that on the PC or Kindle.When I pick an album, it puts a picture of it but beneath it will list tracks from various albums from the artist. It ends with and more but you cant click on anything. You press play and it turns into a random playlist.  Other that the album cover, theres almost nothing to do with the album specifically on the screen. So whats the point of doing a search for an album?And going back to my own playlist you cant play a specific track on it. Only play in general. Just dont get why that normally functionality was left out"
Keeps opening up to link to get the app even though I have it. So when I wanna listen to music it says download the app even though I already have it and it keeps on doing that to the point where I cant even type the song I wanna listen to at the moment and the thing is it does this despite me having premium and it also doesnt let me listen to tracks that arent  downloaded when Im far away from my wifi network even though I have unlimited cell data
Apple Watch playback still missing?. Ive been a Spotify subscriber since it started in the US. Im going to have to sign off now because for whatever reason the iOS team is still not pushing to make Apple Watch playback a priority. The capability have been around since iOS 13 and theyve totally dropped the ball. Im very disappointed that I have to lose my listening history and carefully curated playlist because the Apple Watch platform isnt a priority
Ads are annoying  Not pleased that my custom playlist is now being interrupted by these ads . Personal playlists should not be subjected to advertisements
"Hey Spotify voice search doesnt work anymore. Could you all update the firmware to get the Hey Spotify voice search back? Its really the reason I use Spotify over YouTube music. Without it, it feels not worth it to have premium. Ive deleted and redownloaded the app, cleared the cache, cleared downloads, accepted tracking, turned microphone permissions on and off, rebooted my iPhone (SE 2nd gen) several times, and still no luck. I dont think Im the only one with this issue so please look into it for me Its the best part of Spotify, seriously Thanks"
Podcast Playing. It does a bad job of remembering where I am in a podcast. If I stop midway through and come back later it tracks it as listened to. So it disappears from my new list and when I find it I have to listen to everything again. I only use Spotify for one network and I wish they didn\'t move
"Best. Spotify is the best music app I have ever downloaded, I came from eastern part of Nigeria and I could still search for old old music, surprisingly Spotify will get it for me, the exact track I was hoping to play. I love you Spotify"
Doesnt work. Ive been paying for premium for years now and in the past couple months none of my downloaded songs play off-line and nothing plays when I use my data very frustrated its getting to the point where I want to cancel my account not happy
"Whats the point of Apple Watch streaming?. Edit: What ever update you guys released is causing frequent crashes when playing in the background. Home Screen player just drops half way through songs, you have to open the app back up and click play, but the song that was playing before crash is reset to the beginning, as if it is a crash in memory? Its honestly getting frustrating, and if it wasnt for my wife wanting to search her playlists for songs, I would have cancelled Spotify and went to Apple Music.I love the app and company. The weekly playlists that are made for me personally are the reason why Ill never leave (maybe i will since my edit), but what is going on with the Apple Watch?I see Im in the Beta for streaming from Apple Watch, but theres no point in it if the  phone needs to be connected to it. I should be allowed to use my Apple Watch data to stream. It really seems pointless to me"
Spotify acting up. Spotify wont download any podcasts for me (on wifi and data both) and also the app randomly stops working and shuts down (on wifi and data both as well)
"Cant delete a playlist. If youre sitting behind a desk and reading this, could u fix the bug that prevents ppl from deleting a personal playlist?"
"App crashing?. Ive used spotify for years and Ive always loved it and considered it a 5-star app, but recently its been crashing and acting really weird. My songs will play, but if Im connected to wifi then theyll stop in the middle and the app will crash entirely. The only way my songs play as normal is if Im on online mode and using data. Im not sure whats up with it, but please fix this xx"
"Downloads. Why do I always have to download my already downloaded playlist I made every time I go offline and come back online after a day or two? Why? This is really frustrating, and eats up my data. If this isnt handled Im going back to Apple Music"
"30 Mins Free For Ads && Skipping Ads Dont Work AT ALL. 2.5 Stars .. Not Even 3 .. If You Change Stations Your 30 Mins Ad Free Is Gonna Reset To None , NOT Including Skips [Cuz For Whatever Reason They Can Clearly Keep Track Of Those ) If I Have NO Choice But To Pay For ad Free Music Ima Use Apple Music That COMES W. My Phone .. Or Use Tidal"
Where I left off. The app doesnt track where I left off half the time. Its even worse at tracking it between computer and phone. Sometimes it will just say I played the whole episode when I didnt
MUST DOWNLOAD THIS AMAZING APP. This app is sooo awesome I can play anything and any song I want You can also listen to podcast. One thing I wish that I want this amazing app is data. So I can listen to my songs anywhere
Need to do this instantly. I personally think you should be able to listen to your playlist with no wifi and not just premium can do it. It isnt fair for people who have to pay a fortune for it i just dont know what app to use to listen to my favourite songs without data/wifi. You must make it so i can listen to music offline
Please bring back the and more button. When viewing an artists page. I dont understand the point of dissembling that button. Therefore making it near impossible to discover new artists for your personal playlists without having to go through shuffle listening to every single song without being able to get past songs you might not like. This doesnt make me want to buy a monthly subscription. The end
"Missing features. It s really wonderful the remote control; session control from remote device rather, works, mostlyMissing are features to gather ones tastes.Mood Logic is the first attempt I have known at automagically categorizing logical similarities in mp3s, pitch pace and tempocrowd sourced info has really made that track analysis irrelevant, and Spotify does it pretty well, all things considered.What would be useful is adding tracks from certain radio station/playlists, when suggested songs play after the playlist has been exhausted.This does not seem to function in all areasIt seems the main issue lies in the interface flow.  There are redundant screens, that typically contain the same options, but have different settings cached among them different ways to get to the same screen, yet not containing all of the functions that screen holds, due to the method of accessing it, and what trail is left behind.What would be nice for the iPhone app is a back button that does not disappear at certain navigationally incongruent area.Theres much more to mention; however that will wait until circumstances of the people in control subsides"
"Not as Good as Apple Music. This app is honestly the worst. It always glitches, says you can use it in offline mode so you can save on data, but if you do no song plays and it just glitches out and you have to reinstall the app to fix it and the problem just reoccurs. Apple Music is the better of the two, sadly they have songs others dont. "
"10 year premium member. As the title says, I have been a premium member for 10 years. I love this app, I have dozens of playlists with thousands of songs in them. With that said I am extremely close to cancelling.I am so tired of having to reinstall this app and re-download my playlists.I work in an area with poor data reception and no wifi. I rely on my downloaded playlists. For the past year I have had to reset everything every few days. The songs show they are downloaded but will not play. I have clicked the download slider off, waited several minutes and then selected to download again. It then immediately downloads them as if they are already on the device and they work for a few days. Then I am back to square one.If this is responded to, NO I will not contact support. I have done this multiple times and get the same useless steps to complete. I have researched the issue and see that it is happening to many people. You continuously update, lets try fixing the issue and stop making it our fault.The next time I have to go through this process I will uninstall and cancel service"
Thanks. Hoping to find a way to get the music on without needing data or wifi. But all and all the music is good when on data
Free version track list. Why are free users unable to view the track list of albums? This feature never used to be special and has no reason to be restricted. Its stupid that I have to exit my music app and go elsewhere to view the track list of an album
"Synced music. Synced music wont load without a data connection, whats the point of that?"
Needs WiFi. I wish I could just use my cell phone data to listen to music but idk why its not letting me
"Ughh. They took the download filter button out? As someone without unlimited data, I was so grateful they added it this year. And now its gone. I cant even see what playlists in my list i have downloaded. Worst update ever"
"New changes. There is a lot more adds, its to the point where YouTube has  less add time in theory. But this app is more data friendly though"
"Fantastically Buggy. For the worlds biggest streaming app its brilliantly mediocre. The amount of issues with interrupted streaming is off the charts. Songs and podcasts pausing, app crashing, inability to load and play songs on a whim. If it werent for the apps algorithms to generate playlists and its content I would go elsewhere without hesitation. Im a 28yo tech savvy person, I have up to date devices and software, I understand how data, WiFi, broadband, 4g all works I know that its not me that makes this app unreliable. Also, if I need internet just to view my downloaded songs, what good is that?? It renders the feature totally useless. It just about serves its basic function, most of the time but for a company of this size with this many users really should do better. For those of you that love it, great. Theres my opinion"
"Apple Watch Issues. My Apple Watch 7 48mm worked great with Spotify for a week. Then for no reason, in the middle of the day it just doesnt work. The now playing comes up, but controls are greyed out, no volume control or track title. Ever so often the track title does come up, but its different than the track thats playing. Help"
"Worst Podcast App on the App Store?. Is Spotify the worst app on the App Store, or just the worst PODCAST app?I have the free version. I gave it 2 stars, because that is 40% of 5, and thats about how often it works on opening. I use it for 2 podcasts, not found elsewhere. I routinely have to close and rest start 3-5 times to get it to play. Sometimes it never does, whether on cell data or WIFI. All but useless"
The gayest music app ever. Hey guys if you just want to listen to ads download this app
"Buying this because I have to and I dont like it. I know your not paying the musicians enough for the blood sweat and tears they endured to be covered with a blanket membership fee. This takes an even deeper stab at disassociating the listener from the artist than what Apple did with Itunes. You will get yours one day, art will always prevail, and those who chase money for personal gain always loose themselves in the process"
"Useless app. Very annoying app. Randomises tracks, can only skip a few, interrupts with ads - never pay for this junk. If the free version is this bad they dont deserve your money"
FREE VERSION IS AWFUL. I know they are just trying to make money but the free version doesnt even let you pick a song to listen to without having to listen to their shuffle also if you make a PRIVATE PERSONAL PLAYLIST they add random songs. If you pay you get decent quality but the free version is the most awful thing ever (wouldnt recommend)
My Personal Radio. Love how you can customize your own playlist or play others playlist and enjoy new recommendations
Good. App is good but is currently down and often malfunctions when mobile data is used
"Always. Nothing bad to say, I have had premium for years. Seventeen bucks a month and the whole family listens to music all the time and we all have found new sounds we like. Cheap price for unlimited music. You can download any of it when you have premium and listen without data, too"
"had enough. ive had this app for a few years.. its been all good until a few months ago. its not playing my songs from my playlist, its repeating ads to the point i know the words to them, and its kicking me out the app. i tried running it on data, the same thing. happens, then i did data and wifi, still didnt work"
"Spotify on the 80s. The 80s is my favourite decade ever - brilliant music that I never tire of playing.  I love Spotify for giving me access to songs &amp; tracks from that amazing time. And for giving me the means to compile my own playlists of all my favourites, enabling me to listen to the music I love best &amp; setting the mood to whatever I want. The choice is endless Thanks Spotify One complaint - too many of the same advert - could be more varied"
This Sucks. This app is terrible if you dont buy the premium version. You can only skip 6 songs every hour. You have to listen to music using wifi or data. When you try to listen to your music every 30 seconds it stops playing. Also when you are listening to your playlist it will play random suggested songs. Overall this app is a piece of crap
"Recommendation. Great app Just a recommendation, could you please allow the mobile app to change the cover of your personal albums you make. I know you can already do this on a MacBook but it would be much appreciated if it could also be introduced to the mobile version of the app. Thank you :)"
"Data and saved songs. I have multiple I would like to see addressed. At home my wifi loses internet connection a lot and when I go to my library (which Ive downloaded onto my phone) I click on an album and the songs do not load up. The dots just blink across the screen even though I have the songs downloaded. I then put my phone into airplane mode, disconnecting internet entirely, and the songs immediately appear and I am able to listen to them. Please change it so that I do not use internet or data to view the songs that I have downloaded on my phone. Thank you. Also my downloaded songs frequently delete themselves from my library. They remain kicked but I have to redownload every song. SomeTimes over 1000 songs at a time"
"Good for personal use not good for office. Their Commercials are very inappropriate for office environment . Also commercials are twice louder than music settings , so it will literally start screaming about menstrual excessive bleeding relief at the middle of the meeting. so its definitely a big NO for office /workHowever for personal use at home I like it"
"Why the Suggested Tracks?. As the title suggests, I have a HUGE problem with the suggested tracks. 1. They dont even ask for your consent before switching tracks2. Ill be listening to one of my biggest comfort songs and then all of the sudden a really upbeat and loud song comes on without warning. It gives me a huge anxiety attack especially because im neurodivergent :( 3. Whenever they play a suggested track, theres literally NO songs that I like and the songs they play arent similar to my music taste at all.Stop forcing me to get out of my comfort zone. It makes me get severe anxiety attacks and I get so overwhelmed by loud noise im perfectly fine with my songs as they are. stop giving us suggested tracks, or at least ask us before you play it so we have a heads up. :/Thanks for the constant meltdowns,-An autistic listener"
CHANGE THE PLAYLIST FORMAT BACK. The playlist configuration is just AWFUL now. I cant like an album or a friends playlist without it pushing all my personal playlists out of sight ???? I cant find any of my own stuff now its terrible. CHANGE IT BACK
"Love, but IT WONT WORK. I love this app always listening to music but when I got the premium to try it out, it wont let me listen offline. I can only listen on line and I use all my data My mom is super mad at me... please can u fix it or tell me what I am doing wrong because I might have to find a different app that can do the same thing "
"Fix for offline Ford Sync. Love the app but I have limited data. I bought the premium to download songs and listen in my Ford truck. When I am offline and hook up my cord for Apple Carplay on my stereo, I can only see my first 6 or so choices in my library or playlist? I can pick all my music from my phone just not on my stereo controls? It my be a Ford problem but maybe not? My wife&#39;s Ford does the same thing"
Premium. I cant upgrade to premium and you have to have data for it
WHY. Why must you reccomend tracks that are LITERALLY CONNECTED to the playlist I hate that you add songs JUST STOP
Love music. This is the best app to be your own personal DJ to your life story
Not worth paying for. After I lost my downloads again for the 100th time. Ill just stream on data in lower quality from now because thats what Ive had to do
"Long time paying customer here. At 6:30 PM on May 6th 2020 the app would crash repeatedly upon launch. It turns out this was the result of Spotify using the Facebook iOS SDK in the app. The issue was on Facebooks side, not Spotifys. This affected most users and even those that do not log into Facebook through Spotify. I have long disconnected from Facebook and so it is ridiculous for Spotify to have so much integration with Facebook that an issue with Facebook could cause the app to fail to launch. Please remove the Facebook SDK and restore our privacy"
Its really good. Its really really good whether you have premium or not honestly.. at first I didnt have premium and even then there used to be these 30 minute intervals where you could listen to your music and then a few ads come up which I wasnt too mad about. With premium its even better but for some reason I though it would work without mobile data but it hasnt worked for me so far that maybe my mistake Im not too sure
deleting this app. Neil Young > Joe Roganany app that supports dissemination of misleading covid 19 info during a global pandemic while hundreds of thousands of people are dying i cannot support
RIP OFF. GUYS DONT GET THIS APP ITS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. YOU CAN PNLY SKIP 6 SONGS EVERY HOUR UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY WHICH IS BLODDY ANNOYING. ALSO WAY TOO MANY ADS AND U MIGHT AS WELL JUST USE MUSIC THATS ALREADY DOWNLOADED ON UR PHONE. ITS SUCH A ROP OFF
"Bring back I dont like this options. With the change to version 8.5.66, I can no longer hide tracks from playlists (which was at least something) or use the older and superior options I dont like this track or  I dont like this artist"
"Cant even use the app anymore. It crashes so much and is so buggy that I cant enjoy my music, Im considering switching to Apple Music because its awful. Anytime Im not connected to the internet (wifi) it just constantly crashes. When I try to watch podcasts out of the house, even though I have the podcast downloaded, it still streams. Because of that, I disabled my cellular for Spotify and IT STILL STREAMS. This is brutal, its eating up all my data even though my data is disabled for the app. Anytime I try and listen, it crashes and I lose my place on the podcast or song. Fix this soon please cuz Ive been dealing with it for close to 2 months"
"Doesnt work properly on mobile data. Have premium - only lets you listening on wifi not mobile, its not a setting Ive tried everything"
"I love your app HOWEVER I did find one bug thats screwing with me. First of all, this app is great and I love using it for my art and for every day things in general. But, recently I have been unable to play my music on my phone. Whenever I try to play a song the music stops playing all of a sudden I try to skip to the next song and go back but it doesnt work most of the time and sometimes even breaks the next song and doesnt let me listen to it either. Now I dont know if this is an issue with my storage or not because this started right after I got a warning about the space on my device and problems downloading songs I had already downloaded previously. However, I am certain I fixed the issue awhile ago and Im still having the same problem Hopefully Im not the only one experiencing this but if even if I wasnt, I would love a response on the matter because this is becoming a quite a nuisance since I rely on Spotify for most of my music for most of my day But Besides that, Thank you for reading and I hope this issue gets fixed soon Thank you for the music you provide us and keep up the incredible work "
Recent update greys out tracks on mobile. This latest update has left me unable to play any songs that I havent downloaded - when using mobile data. When on mobile the songs are all greyed out and unplayable
"Cant play downloaded songs offline. Spotify has been working perfectly for YEARS but after this new update, I cant play my downloaded playlists offline. They only work when I use data or wifi. Please fix ASAP"
"Its Broken. Im not sure what happened to my app however I have an Iphone 6s and I open spotify to play music like i do every other night and nothing is loading. I have restarted my phone, reinstalled the app and tried to work on both data and wifi, nothing seems to be working. My playlists are popping up but apparently they have been wiped. I cant access the search bar without there being an error and the home page wont load due to some error"
Broken UI. No track listings under albums means youre forced into using shuffle. And it gets worse by throwing other albums/artists into that shuffle playlist despite the option being deactivated. Shocking experience? 1/5 F-
Fix the app. You cant even look at a albums track list on the free version. Also when you play an album with the free version there are songs that shuffle WHICH ARENT EVEN IN THE ALBUM. I find it very unprofessional that your unable to subscribe to premium within the app
"Almost a bad apps. It says that if I watch this ads it will gave you 30 mins. listening to music, but it isnt. LIAR"
Spying tracking chill out. Chill bro
Garbage app. I got several playlists downloaded but they still dont work without wifi/data Apple Music definitely the wave next year
Love this app just wish they would add compatibility with Apple Watch. Honestly I love this app and almost everything it has to offer. I just wish they would update the Apple Watch app so that you can download playlist for when youre going out without your phone
Re downloading. I constantly have to redownload my music which always seems to happen when I dont have WiFi available. And using all that data to download something for the 3rd or 4th time isnt worth it and gets very frustrating
"5 stars downgraded to 2 stars. Since the update, it started redownloading 70% of previously downloaded podcasts, which ate up all 30GB of my data in less than 24hours without my knowledge or permission. I had it so you could only download over wifi but clearly that is not a thing apparently. I still enjoy the songs, and podcasts but now its super finicky to even download something over wifi and I cant play stuff at work now since I have no wifi or data. Please resolve this and Ill consider this a 5* app once again"
"Name of Playlist on Screen. Can you make it so that while Im listening to one of my playlists, the name of the playlist appears on the screen? I have to always be opening my device in my vehicle to see if the song playing is one that I downloaded. If it isnt, I pay for data used to my mobile phone carrier. Can I do something so my music doesnt stray from my playlist?"
"6 second rule. For whatever reason I only get six seconds of music at a time. Even songs that i have downloaded to my phone sometimes wont play at all, or will play for 6 seconds and then stop.Ive tested on wifi & on data and have yet to find a reason why this keeps happening to music i have downloaded to my phone"
"Confused. Ive used this app for many years now and have had no real issue with it.. but, there are certain songs that it refuses to play for me. Ive tried using wifi, my own phone network, and its still a no go. This is ridiculous, there is no reason why I shouldnt have access to these songs"
"App wont open anymore??. Have been a heavy user and subscriber of Spotify for years.  Discovered today the will no longer opens on my phone. I recently upgraded to an iPhone 11...not sure if thats part of the problem? I tried offloading the app &amp; data and then reinstalling, to no avail. Whats up, Spotify?"
"Keeps Crashing. Love Spotify, but the app on my iPhone is constantly crashing since the last update. When I delete it and download the app again, all the tracks and playlists Id made available offline I have to download again- very frustrating"
"No other like it. The best app for music. I wont use anything else. I use it on my  phone got it on my tv, computer. I take it wherever I go.  Great for parties or any gathering it like your own personal dj  playing all the music you like and recommending artist you never heard before. I love it"
Worst app ever dont get on phone. Whenever you add a track to your playlist it sometimes add more itself and when you wanna listen to your own track it plays a suggestion I hate this and it better get fixed or Im deleting this
"Better than Apple Music. However, the constant updates and user interface changes are extremely irritating. When something works  just leave it. I think many of the recent changes make the platform overly complicated and less intuitive, and the video cover art consumes unnecessary data"
Personal Jukebox. Incredible collection of music and categorization
"Worthy review,Dont bother looking for others. Straight up the best music app ever, lyrics for every. Single.Song. and is a great deal for unlimited songs with downloading so no need for data"
"Whats the point of Apple Watch streaming?. I love the app and company. The weekly playlists that are made for me personally are the reason why Ill never leave, but what is going on with the Apple Watch?I see Im in the Beta for streaming from Apple Watch, but theres no point in it if the  phone needs to be connected to it. I should be allowed to use my Apple Watch data to stream. It really seems pointless to me"
"The past few updates have been so great. The last update made my playlist info (cover, bio, etc.) sync immediately on all of my devices So happy with this app on my laptop, iPad, and phone. Keep the amazing work up"
Stop. Stop giving me suggested tracks and not give me my playlist. You keep giving me a playlist full of random songs and its really annoying I want my songs
Could be better. Everything great but need to be able to move your liked songs around. You accidentally unlike a song an then you lose its spot in your personal playlist and it goes back to the top where I have completely different genres. This would be such An easy thing seeming as you can do it on the pc but why not the phone???
Still crashes when in the background. The app used to be good but since around iOS 14 release the app just closes if I leave the app while listening to music so I HAVE to leave my phone on regular power mode and turn off auto lock and stay within the app in order to listen to music its very sad because I can just do that with YouTube. I cant lock my device or switch apps without Spotify crashing and logging out/deleting data/reinstalling/resetting/powering off phone does not fix the problem. My 3GB of RAM on my 7 Plus should be more than enough for your app
Only worth it if you have premium. Its only worth it if you have both unlimited data and premium
Wifi compatibility is horrible. Great app... but I absolutely hate how it act when Im just getting outta range of my wifi... if Im waking away from my house with headphones it pretty much stools working for over a min until it decides to stop searching. For wifi and use data  or whatever is happening but this is almost enough to skip Spotify all together when walking in town passed multiple Starbucks and other open wifi areas
"Cant stay on one album. It cant even play the full tracks on an album ,the app always changes the album I rather use Sound Cloud or pandora"
"Love it but. I love Spotify. I use it almost every day. But recently, with its new update, whenever im playing music on my phone, it crashes mid song and when I open it again, the song I was listening to starts from the beginning and crashes again. It happens 1 or 2 times and then it plays it normally. I dont like this at all. PLEASE FIX THIS. Also, I dont know why but I cant see an albums track list. I hit the track list to see the songs I want to hear and it recognizes the click but it doesnt open. Its getting really annoying and irritating. Please fix this. Overall, its a great app and I really recommend it. There are just a few things that could improve"
"Connectivity. Issues with downloaded my music not playing, and ALWAYS saying there is no connection when in wifi and mobile data is on"
"and more button not working. ive been using spotify for almost 3 years now, and ive been very happy with it so far even without a premium membership. for a while now it has been impossible to see the track list of an album by pressing and more, which was not so much of a problem, but recently this has happened to any playlist i view. its very frustrating, and makes the app somewhat hard to use. if this is an issue that needs to be solved, i hope it will be fixed soon and my rating would definitely change to five stars overall i was very happy with the app before this issue"
Great app. Its an amazing app and I wouldve never made it through school without it but i have had issues with the app such as taking up tons of space. I have around 10 gb of data in Spotify but I dont really mind it because its my downloads. I have about 70-80 playlists downloaded and a ton of podcasts downloaded as well its a great app and I recommend it to everyone
Trash. Plays to many suggested track that arent related to anything
Hackers. Hacking into iOS lock screen stealing info
Cant play already downloaded music. I was not able to play songs I have already downloaded and also I cant seem to stream even I am on high speed internet. Is it because of new update? What good it is if you cant stream a song on a music streaming service.Only the first song plays after you reopen the app. If you skip the track all the info of the next track loads but the song does not play if if the song is downloaded on your phone
Listening History. Would be a better service if we were able to view our recently played tracks. I listen to so many songs in a day and I have them on my playlist. Would be helpful for those who have diverse large libraries to view recently played songs
Wonderful. My personal curator. This app seems to know my taste when it chooses new music for me
"Technical issues. Like listening and discovering musics with playlistHowever, app is unstable and keeps shutting itself while listening with no apparent reason, forcing to reopen, and start again.Very annoying to say the least.Plus, there is no option in the app to report technical problems as it is in other apps that allows to have all tech data embedded into the report. Why not?"
"Very poor for classical music. A number of suggestions for improvement have been made online and ignored or dismissed by Spotify representatives. It used to be possible to drag and drop columns to view the full song title. Why was this functionality removed? Why are song titles for classical music arranged in such a way as to create a list of all the information for that track, including the composer, artists, work title etc. before finally telling us which track were on? And why is the search function so useless? If I search for a fugue in c minor, I will be met with hundreds of results for a fugue in *d* minor because it happens to be more popular, even though Ive explicitly specified a different piece. For £120 a year, this really isnt good enough"
Feedback. it would be so much better if we didnt have to have wifi or data just play these songs :(
"Slow down with the ads. When I am listening to music after every 5 minutes of music an ad just starts that is about 4 minutes in length, l dont want to waste my data on things I dont want to listen"
"What-. Im writing this now because ever since the new update came out, I havent been able to play music even when its been downloaded for offline purposes. I cant play any songs either when Im online. It only allows me to play songs that Ive recently listened to and its annoying. Overall this ia a good app for music, highly recommend downloading it. Ill update this review once I have enough info to add"
"Not as good as some of its competitors. There is a download limit on the number of songs you can have on one device, which may not get in the way of most users, but I listen to a lot of different music.  The app is also poorly optimized for running in offline mode.  Works great connected to WiFi, but I drive for a living and dont have unlimited data.  All that, coupled with their backing of Joe Rogan and his Covid misinformation has me thinking its time to switch back to Apple Music"
"VPN equal no podcasts. If you have a VPN, it will not allow you to watch or listen to podcasts until you turn off your vpn so it can steal all your information"
Theyre r*cist. They signed Joe Rogan a $100 million contract while he has said n*gger over 50 times in the course of his podcast. Now to try and cover their tracks theyre using $100 million to get POC on their app. Delete delete delete Ill use Apple Music over this
Only put 5 starts so ppl would see. If i put on my playlist it shouldnt say suggested track i want to listen to my music not your trash music. Thanks. Day 2. Im gonna do unalive all i wanna do is listen to music on the bus but im getting these dumb songs that i do NOT like. Booty suckers
Can listen to anything unless connected to wifi. I can listen to one song on repeat if I start off connected to wifi. I have data. But I cant even listen to my downloaded songs for the past several months despite paying for premium
"Login could use work. I really liked the app on my last phone but upon getting a new phone I ended up loggin in with the wrong Facebook account and now every time I attempt to login via Facebook it uses that same account and wont let me switch to the account I intend to use. So far Ive only had that problem on the app. But knowing how the app functions outside of my login issue I cant give it less than three stars, its my favorite way to stream music, the curated playlist are phenomenal and its a great way to keep track of podcasts"
Playlist. I cant edit what songs are in my personal playlists on my iPhone
I love it but. Its simple to me at least see Im trying to listen to Hamilton songs and it keeps playing stuff on a suggested track like frozen songs and I switched like 20 times between different tracks and playlists and I cant listen to them instead Im stuck listening to frozen and shrek on suggested tracks. I might as well just search up the songs than use Spotify because of this
"AWESOME. This app is awesome you can have bad words songs not be allowed to play watch the music video and make playlists as well as follow your friends Great for ages 12 and up. The other day my dad told me about a song and I played it and he told me about the music video and how it was so cool, but this app shows it while playing. You also dont have to watch it. All for free on WiFi or Data"
"Dope but one problem. So when I hit on a song an add comes on an it says enjoy the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening and like after 2 songs it does another ad. And I dont even slip any songs. Look, I love this app but please shorten the ads. Other than that, the app is great because you can listen to any song in the world, for frees His app is incredible and Im looking for very good updates in the future Thank you for your time.-Charlie"
"Wont let me listen to downloaded music without wifi or data. When I download music, when I open it without wifi. It doesnt let me play the music and sometimes wont download the music for me"
"Great App Really Recommend It. I absolutely love this app, even if you dont have WiFi or mobile data you can download your playlists or albums and play them anywhere I also like that there is unlimited song choice and its just perfect to play, on the go, anywhere If youre looking for a nice reliable music app then Id give this a go"
"All genres of music. Incredible range of music as you ask for tracks,Then Spotify picks up your favourites and extends it to other similar artists and tracks.Absolutely brilliant.MORG"
What an App. This is the best app that Ive ever come acrossI love that there are so many choice of music and podcast to choose from. And its great that you can download podcast online for future long road trips without needing data. I love this app so much that I even recommended it to a few people in my life
Why do you hate me?. Im getting really tired of turning on my liked songs and it playing crap ive NEVER listened to or have ever listened to anything like it. Its dumb. Stop playing the top hits of this year instead of my suggested track. Its seriously annoying.  I do like this app and use it often but this makes the whole app 10x worse
THIS APP IS INCREDIBLE. This app is great because you can play music and youre favourites
"Podcast. Just want an option to not stream the video of a podcast, uses to much data"
Offline. Hey when u guys updated it i guess it now has a option where you press the button to go offline its not good my music doesnt play when offline and aint smooth it keep freezing when off line an my music is already downloaded change it back i dont know but i have premium cause when my data speed limit would run out it would be hella useful and now its worse than without premium it please fix
"Great App, need HI-Fi to keep up. Great app and music, but with amazon and tidal going all in on hifi streaming, they need to get on that game or change the codec to get better quality. Tons of people have unlimited data plans so it shouldnt be that much of an issue"
"Spotify on the 80s. The 80s is my favourite decade ever - brilliant music that I never tire of playing.  I love Spotify for giving me access to songs &amp; tracks from that amazing time. And for giving me the means to compile my own playlists of all my favourites, enabling me to listen to the music I love best &amp; setting the mood to whatever I want. The choice is endless Thanks Spotify"
"Eh. I like the app a lot but I dont think it should cost $10 monthly for premium because youre just listening to music. I listen to music all the time for background noise but its annoying that you either pay $10 a month or have to listen to more ads than music and not be able to skip however many times you want. I also dislike how you pay monthly for something that isnt even officially yours, you own it until you cant pay and then all the money is basically wasted. I personally think the price should be lowered because it costs about the same as a tv subscription yet it does not compare to something like Netflix but thats just my personal opinion. "
"Broken Queue. Good app but stop it with the meaningless updates, they keep breaking the app. This time it&#39;s the queue. Every time I add a song I look at the list of songs and there are no track names or art and spotify stops playing music altogether when it reaches one of the many songs that show up this way.Also, where is my recently played playlist???? It is such a basic function. I must create a new playlist to view the songs that I just listened to?"
"Love. Fantastic app, love being able to like songs and create personal playlists"
Best music streaming app there is. You cannot convince me a better music streaming service exists. Its so easy to use and gear quality. And only $9.99 a month? Bro thats a steal literally incredible price for the best streaming service
"DO NOT LOAD. This app will take everything from your location to your bank account, track everything you have done on the Internet and all the people you have talked to If youre cool with everyone having knowledge of everything youve ever done on the Internet by all means go ahead and download this app. But be aware that your grandmother may find out that you are a huge fan of Cyndi Lauper"
"Mediocre review. Despite constantly downloading all my podcasts and music, I still end up using an extraordinary amount of data. Also, a lot of my music and podcasts dont end up working off-line despite having premium membership"
"the new update :/ (9/8/2020). i NEED my music. and this new update isnt allowing me to play my music. when i try to play the songs that i have downloaded, i am not able to. not even with cellular data, even though i havent needed it for downloaded songs in the past. i need this fixed quick, fast, and in a hurry. please please please"
"Playing suggested track. First of I would like to say good the app is by all means, but I dont like how it plays songs that l have never added to my playlist and most of the time I dont like the songs in the suggested track and it does this repetitively and it is annoying. Even though I have only been a user for 2 years it didnt do that Play Suggested Track and even when my playlists are hours longs"
Data saver. Cannot turn off data saver no mater what which also doesnt let me change the audio quality. Other than that its good
The UI....from hell. I just hate it. Searching is caps sensitive. Goodness me... why I cant just endlessly Browse albums. Very personal playlist oriented. Who cares? Give me curation thats not mainstream. How hard is it?
"Offline glitch. If I dont have wifi or data, it takes TOO long to load my downloaded music. Most of the time I cant even access it. I have playlists, podcasts and individual songs saved but I cant access it when I need it most  Samsung s10+"
"MAKE IT WORK. For the amount of money you get from subs and now ads in podcasts, youd think you could make your apps work across platforms, but no. Too much to ask for, it seems.  Cant watch Rogan on Samsung TV.  Cant listen without draining data on phone.  Its about time to switch to Apple Music"
"Remove suggested tracks. Why does it have to add random songs, and randomly stop playing. And I hate when it plays suggested tracks. Best music app overall"
". The app is completely broken If I put on a song then it plays a different song Like if I wanted to listen to Deja Vu, it would play Sugar Crash I cant even listen to the songs in my personal playlist Please fix this "
Disappearing Downloads. Im sick of my downloads disappearing then draining my data because I think Im playing downloaded material
"great, but. i wanted to put 5 stars but i figure you would never look at my suggestions if i did so here we are with 4so its like much better than apple music as far as like aesthetic and the playlists and everything are great its all greatthe only problems:1) when you listen to downloaded music you have to have wifi/data to start the song.it will finish once you turn it off but it wont start even when its downloaded.i didnt have this problem with apple music so it would be nice to be fixed but its not that bad and definitely not a deal breaker for me considering all of the pros2) yall keep taking away the feature where you click the full screen gif and it shows you the album cover but i like. you should keep it3) it would be cool if you made liking songs available even when your phone is like not opened or whatever instead of having to like completely open the app but idk if thats something you can control or if thats apples fault4) why is it so difficult to change the pic for a playlist? you have to use a computer but like why not a phone?5) you should add lyrics like apple music but i understand this would be very difficult because you would have to like put all the lyrics in yourself unless you collab with a lyrics app but you already collab with genius it seems for the bits of info about some songs so why not lyrics?overall its great though, there are so many pros but those are my cons"
Thanks for not blocking information. Thanks for not blocking people to tell their stories. Please keep allowing open conversations. Allowing people to have the freedom to make a choice
"Why cant I listen to the music I want??. I dont recommend getting this app. It only lets you have 6 skips per hour, It auto adds random songs to your playlist, It makes you listen to some random suggested track, SO SO MANY ADDSHorrible app dont install"
Keeps turning off my music when connected to data or wifi. This was not happening before
"Why??. Its great and you can play any track you want It also easy to access but I wish premium was available for everyone so we can get as many skips as we want. But, I understand thats how you make more money to keep it running"
App. Very good app but i really dont like when a suggested track comes up instead of your own playlist but everything else is so good Ill leave 5 stars
"I love this app. Look this app is great and all knowing you can listen to anything with your phone off and all but i wish you could add like a previous track button i don&#39;t want to listen to another 69 tracks just to go back to that song.Also 6 skips per hour? To me that doesn&#39;t make sense to me why 6 why such a little number at least make it 12 or 10 just why 6 Something else is that please stop adding songs to my track i don&#39;t want your recommended songs i know which songs i want bot only that but come on You Cant Even Remove it I don&#39;t want to listen to your recommended songs trust me i know what i want to listen to.And put a little less frequent ads not only that but come on your putting like 50 ads every time that really annoys me make it 2 instead of 5,000.Thank you"
Get rid of suggested track. Get rid of suggested track It stupid
"BE LTE FRIENDLY. when i listen to new music without data (using LTE) the songs take long to start &amp; the music stops without pausing for a couple seconds, then continues to do that also every couple seconds. i also cant look at an artist bc it will say &#34;can&#39;t load the page, try again?&#34; yet when you click reload, it doesn&#39;t reload"
"Will not allow 2 devices. Says family share, BS.   Have app on android phone and tried to load on iPad.  Will not allow without changing password.  App on phone is in English, cant change to English on iPad.  Most infuriating app I have ever loaded.  If I hadnt spent so much time building playlists I would dump the whole thing.  Obviously the children programmers never heard of KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid.  40 years programming and would have been fired for writing something as user unfriendly as this.  Might try iTunes  or Amazon instead"
NEEDS TO HAVE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. my account and many other people i know have had their PREMIUM accounts hacked because hackers are able to share our info and sell it :/ definitely dont think this would happen as much if two factor authentication was a feature. this is also the reason i stopped paying for premium
"Just deleted. Used to be my preferred streaming service - but the promotion of podcasts containing mis/disinformation means Ive deleted it permanently.  We dont need companies getting rich by stirring up controversy.  And I need my Neil Young and Joni Mitchell tracks, so Ill go with them, thanks"
"Stops randomly. I use it on my new iphone 11 and it keeps stopping randomly. Im not using my data, Im using wifi and everything else on my phone works perfectly its just spotify. I have to open up the app and press play like that but it happens 1-2 times during a song. I love spotify and its my favorite app to listen to music on but it&#39;s becoming annoying. Its not like its pausing for an ad or because im playing audio on another app"
Update issue IOS15. something is wrong with my downloaded songs they wont play automatically have to skip foward and back to make them play no issues when streaming but if the song is already on my phone it wont auto play my liked tracks
Spotify Premium. Well Gets What Angie Hilton All Of My Shannon Nolls Tracks On My Playlist It Is All About You In Your Pink Dress And In Your White Dress From My Favourite Australian Tv Show Hey Hey its Saturday Plucka Duck Segments Episodes 38 & 39 1999
Seemed best first now I realize it isnt. One good thing about this app is we have access to free music n offline music.But everytime I play a song it pauses very second which is very irritating even with good internet connection or with cellular data.It would be given 5 star if this wasnt a problem
"Downloads redownload after closing. Updated to the newest version. All these new playlist now show where the likes songs go just because I listen to like top 100. I was just checking it out. Its not a top playlist. Also, add to playlist stops working or app stops responding and have to shut down completely. Yes I have uninstalled, reinstalled and have the latest software on my phone. Also my downloaded songs get un-downloaded everytime I closed the app and start downloading every single time. Umm I have 4500 songs. What about my data? Not happy with this new update. New lyric option is cool though. Thats why Ill give it one star. Willing to switch to apple family music if necessary"
5 star. I have given this app a 5 star I just think it is such a good app u can search up any song and it will come up I think it would be better if u didnt need WiFi and u could use it as just a normal iPhone music but you have to have WiFi or data do have the music playing that is the only down for me but apart from that it is a really good app
fix this please. why can we no longer click on the entire list of every song from an artist or playlist? we have to listen to that artist or playlist in order to listen to a song to know if we want it added on our personal playlist. why isn&#39;t it like it used to be where you could play the song for ten seconds max and hear what it sounds like now we have to wait until the next song comes on?
"Not Great in Low Data Areas. I typically download episodes when Im on a WiFi network since using a cell network takes several minutes. Now, youd think that once its downloaded youre good, but no, if one of numerous commercials plays an error message about how playback failed shows up (once the show continues). This only seems to happen when Im in an area where cell data saturation is common. To put an extra spike on it, the download is deleted by the app so the show cant be continued since said cell data saturation prevents downloading"
Ads. Hey I just want to know why watching a 30 second video doesnt grant me 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. Like I watched it and after 1 song I get an ad about Swifer wet jet
"Keeps losing track of place in podcast. Recently, the app will lose track of my progress through a podcast and resume at a point that I already listened to a while ago. Seems to happen most often when I move from one app back into Spotify or when I lock and unlock my phone. It even happens while I am currently listening to a podcast"
"Music made easy. An awesome update they could make is the capability to sort by downloaded so that you dont have to scroll through all your tracks to find the available songs. Hopefully yall read this and could make the change, but I really think this would improve the app"
"Cant stay on one album. It cant even play the full tracks on an album ,the app always changes the album I rather use SoundCloud"
"Mobile data connection on Apple Watch is needed. The app does not work without a connection to the iPhone, which defeats the purpose of enabling mobile data, going for a run and leaving the iPhone at home. Are you guys working on this?"
Kpop. The only reason I downloaded this app was to listen to K-pop and then you remove half the artist I listen to that is the point of this app if it got rid of the one thing I like
"Just one issue. I have a playlist I keep for myself that I have downloaded, but its very easy to just accidentally click a button and everything is just instantly unsaved from my phone. Now, while this is not a huge issue for most people, its only a problem for me because that playlist is over 100 hours, so it takes forever to redownload it, making it very unfortunate for me since it takes forever and my cellular data is shotty so I have to use WiFi"
"Lacks info and flexibility. Plus:Massive music collection Minus:Cant order songs in playlist easily, as in alphabetical etc.Very little accurate information on the actual recordings, original dates, writers, musicians Too much variation in volume between different songs"
"Good App. This app is the best music streaming app out there. You choose what you listen to, they make daily mixes for you, and you can listen to podcasts. One thing I would suggest is stop playing suggested tracks if a playlist isnt an hour long. Its incredibly annoying because the suggested tracks arent the same as the playlist. Other than that, this is the best app for streaming music"
Awesome. If I have unlimited data it is awesomeEven if u dont it is still great
"Well. Okay, its a great app. I love that I can access practically any music I want. But, my playlists keep getting interrupted by suggested tracks after two songs, and its endlessly frustrating. Ive almost given up on it. Please fix this, even though I use Spotify free I think I should be able to listen to my playlists properly"
Personal. A great experience
Great music app. This app is beyond good Its the only trustworthy app I use for my music. You can make your own personal playlists and listen to millions upon millions of songs Name a song and they have it. I love it And theres no limit Havent run into any problems since Ive had the app (2018). They regular update the app too which is nice too You can find your friends too on here and see what their listening too 100% recommend purchasing
"Alright. Its good as it doesnt take up much mobile data, however i do think that there should be unlimited skips and they shouldnt add songs to your playlists"
"Off-line, downloaded content doesnt work. App crushes when playing offline or when switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data in the middle of a workout or while driving"
New update. Since update i cannot open the app with my data
Doesnt work. Premium user of 4+ years and now the app doesnt play downloaded songs and if it does play itll stop at the end of track and not move on
Fraud central. Horrible support process. You dont have access to speak with a person. The only support is through a chat function that doesnt work properly where you lose the input box.  My account gets hacked regularly and there is no dual authentication available
"100 out of 10 would and do recommend. Easily the best app Ive downloaded. The algorithms used to find new music to your liking are incredible. The cross-platform functionality makes listening whenever, wherever a breeze because you can control it from your phone and swap devices in seconds. Ive had Spotify for so long not only do I love the yearly wrap ups but I got a DECADE wrapped last year. The coolest thing I never knew I wanted. A full breakdown of my listening habits and evolution of interests over 10 years"
Good. Its a good app even tho theres an ad every other song which is annoying and it keep closing out of the app for no reason I have perfect wifi and data too but it gets quite annoying when you just want to listen to your music
-Functionality-. The feature Id say that makes this app the most enjoyable for me to use is the related tracks option as I enjoy finding similar sounds and genres without necessarily having to search for it. Very convenient
Personal Playlist Dream. Best app to exist.  
Personal Playlist Dream. Best app to exist. 
"Pls fix this. I love this app so much, but can yall please fix this???? I have an iPhone 11 and I frequently use the offline feature. 2 different occasions after Ive used the feature, 1, my songs kept randomly stopping after a few seconds so I had to delete and reinstall the app. 2, songs and searches were just not loading on data or wifi and again I deleted and reinstalled the app. Please fix this"
Best app ever. Amazing with unlimited data
"Needed improvements. Stop using Cellular Data when playing downloaded content (shouldnt have to go to offline mode)Improve stability: often stops playing or app crashes. When switching from phone to iPad or vice versa, the volume goes to max. Also I prefer to listen to different things on each device so stop changing what Im listening to"
Problems. Ive have had problems logging in I put the correct info and it still says I have the incorrect information
"Downloaded music should be downloaded, right?. A bunch of songs are unplayable, even in downloaded playlists. Every playlist I have, if I have signal, data, wifi, or nothing, at least every other song wont load, or play. Its irritating"
No adds for FREE PLEASE. Get rid of ads or make the personal please
"Personally a great pick for music. I really love this app. But here are some improvements:Having the ability to shuffle and play specific music.Reasoning: I used to want to not listen to the same songs in the same order, but since the update its better off for me to decide what song is next.Offline mode:This mode can be enabled for certain people with no SIM card (like me) who can easily listen ti awesome music with no struggle. Other than that, the app is one of my personal favorites"
"NO OPTION TO CANCEL. WARNING Do not authorize any kind of paymentThere is no way to cancel They keep sending sweet replies about follow this or that link that leads to a warningpageunsafe, unauthorized, hackers might steal your info.  EVERY solution they politely send you leads to the same.its been like this for almost 10 yearshow are they still in business?"
"So great. This app is amazing for so many reasons. 1) It has about any song you can think of. 2) You can download as many songs as you want, so that you can play your music without internet connection. 3) You can make unlimited personal playlists, and edit them in a few seconds. 4) It will tell you when, and where a certain artist is having a concert, and how much the tickets cost. 5) This app is super easy to work with, and not confusing at all. I currently have premium, so I dont know how well it works without, but so far it has yet to deliver a fault. Thanks for reading al the way through"
Account deleted?. The servers melted and somehow my account is showing up as deleted. I should still be able to access the app without logging in to access saved and downloaded music. I dont plan on using this platform anymore
Family plan. Confused about personal play time if I have a family plan. Cant play without the other playing
"Da best. This is one of the best music apps, other than Apple Music, this is the best One thing tho..... I doesnt work with WiFi but most of the time that doesnt bother me cause Im usually home or have my cellular data"
It should be date free so you dont us data. bunnymagget
"new app update. the app got a little weird and i dont like that, i cant play some tracks, if i wanna listen to a track i gotta play the whole album"
"It's a fire app. this whole app is fire, it has it&#39;s own equalizer, most of the songs you like, everything. it&#39;s basically everything you&#39;re looking for in an app. however, it would be cool if the developers were to make it so there&#39;s notifications for a new album from artists, and being able to see how good an album is based on a percent of how many people liked it. it&#39;d also be pretty awesome if the widgets also had a play, pause, and next/previous track button instead of showing the most recent album/playlist that wad played"
Grr. Ok yes I love it but why should we need internet for it cuase in the go we. Wanna. Listen to it and we dont have mobile data
"BROKEN PLEASE FIX. The app just doesn&#39;t let you play what track you would like to play its impossible to use makes me want to throw my phone at the wall Im also an artist and Im sure my listeners are having the same problems as I am as Im trying to hear my own song and its literally impossible to play it there is no play button nothing the apps terrible used to be so good now its completely broken the only thing you can do is make playlists and if you dont pay then u cant even skip what you dont want to hear its just silly tbh you really need to fix this because its depressing and your ruining music for a lot of people .PLEASE FIX  ADD A PLAY BUTTON or something ,no one wants to listen the the tracks your suggesting us"
Hacked?. Every time I log on to my account there are new songs showing up in my liked songs that I never even heard of or would listen to. Seems like someone else has access to my account
9 1/2 out of 10. Because the app is great itself but it triggers my ocd and drains my data so quickly even on data saver i love listening to it on my bus
Bug. It doesnt let me play any music when Im outside for more than 30 seconds even tho I have premium and also have data
"Offline Issues. I downloaded a playlist to listen to while in the car so I dont have to use cellular data. As of the past few months when I listen to it offline, it will quit on its own while in the middle of a song. I could have just started listening or Im a few songs in; it happens unpredictably. Then, I have to go back and queue up the songs I had chosen.  This doesnt make silence if the songs are technically already downloaded on my phone. Makes it really seem like premium isnt worth it if offline doesnt work"
7 minutes isnt 30 minutes. Multiple times now the app asks me to watch a video for a half hour of uninterrupted listening. I watched it today; listened to 2 songs that took about 7 minutes together with no skips and then the ads were already back. That isnt even a 1/3 of the promised time. Just very frustrating because I like most of this app
"Cool. Easy to find any song but often plays the same songs when its done a playlist. Would like if you can better use personal playlists (viewing, move around)"
WARNING new and old users. You have probably ALL been hacked. I have. Delete all your information
"Could you maybe?. Heyo, nice app and all, but maybe make a section where it is MY personal playlists, like the ones I personally created"
"#1 fave music app for the price. The extra features in the premium subscription make me really enjoy the app. Info  given about each song in regards to producers, samples used, etc, radio playlist related to each song, album options and extensive genre libraries, all make this app one of my faves"
Recap suggestion. I think it would be an amazing idea to incorporate the recap into a selectable section of its own called listening statistics where we can see the same type of info we saw on the recap that automatically updates monthly and can be accessed anytime. You guys get 5 stars bc I know you will listen to me and Ill see this option in a near future update
Problems with the queue. Im not sure if its an issue with the latest update or just a personal problem but the app wont let me access the songs I add to the queue. I can add as many as I want and the songs still play but it wont let me switch the order/placement of the songs
"Rogan. Leave him alone, as an American citizen he has a right to express his personal views. Customers can decide to either tune in or not"
One Consistent Problem. App would get 5 stars except for one constant prob over the last 2 weeks. Every time I go offline to save data the song will play for 30 seconds and then the whole app will shut down and stop working and when I open the app back up it doesnt save its spot and I have to start the song over. Does this with every song every time I go offline. Very disappointing
"Songs wont play. Im connected to wif, ive tried data, I have premium and everything. But soon as you pick a song, they song disappears. Whats the point of premium if the songs dont even play?"
"Keeps deleting my downloads and cuts off the end of podcasts. It keeps deleting my downloads like every two weeks. They must have a deal with Comcast to ensure I go over my monthly data cap. Also, they cut off the end of podcasts for no reason. Apple Podcasts doesnt do that"
Loving It. I play one song I like and similar songs play wish it would play without WiFi and Data but spectacular appLoving it at the moment
Bad playback. The songs I play keep on stopping even though my data or wifi works fine. Same for offline plays too
STOP ADDING SONGS. This app is good but the app keeps on adding tracks to my albums. The really need to fix that or let us remove them
"Suggested track. Its a great app, but I hate the suggested track. Everything in it is completely different from what I like, and it keeps butting into the non-garbage music. It uses all my skips and doesnt even get halfway to my normal music. Please add an option to disable it"
"So Not At All Intuitive. This programme seems to cater for a whole different generation. If you just want to search up artists and albums its useless. Its designed for people who dont listen to albums, but prefer to be fed new songs via personal radio stations. Its extremely frustrating trying to do simple, basic things. The symbols dont make sense. I hate it. It seems designed by millennials or younger who have no idea what we old people (Im 43) want. I guess it shows how the younger generation view music and albums, and its all a bit sad. They have lost so much and they dont even know it. Honestly, I just hate it"
"Would be 10 stars if. my music would stop pausing half way through almost all my songs, I have Spotify Premium and I always have wifi or data and even when offline my downloaded songs still stop :("
"Shuffle/data reading. Hello, Ive just upgraded to the iPhone 13 and now Im unable to use shuffle in my car. Its wants to use wifi and not my data. Ive tried deleting and reinstalling but it just wont load songs. any advice is appreciated"
"Thanks for letting me be hacked. In almost 20 years of my adult life Ive never been hacked. I get an email showing a login in 2 foreign countries. Now, I was simply going to remedy that by changing my password and removing my debit card info. Well I cant do that either bc my email account is not recognized. Thanks Spotify. Ill be sure to send all fraudulent charges to your company along with a lawyer to sue you"
Why. So many ads so that I really want to upgrade but I dont want to use money. It said 30 minutes of ad free music after watching the ad and listening to 1 song it plays 3 other adds for no reason. I also turned off auto play and it still gives me suggested tracks so I need to use my skips
The best streaming app. This app is amazing and sounds so incredible especially with an iPhone 12 Pro and JBL speaker. The layout is handsome and all of the graphics are stunning in quality. I used to use YouTube music not anymore this is an amazing music service
Feedback. Liking a song and downloading a playlist are two totally different actions.- and to be honest Id use neither if I could like a playlist. - liking a playlist doesnt mean I want to add all tracks within it to my favourites.Gees
"Best place to get music from (personally). Omg I LOVE THIS. I have had this app for about 3 years with the premium subscription and honestly its not that unaffordable. I had this for a bit without the subscription but it wasnt overwhelming with ads. The only thing was that i couldnt download songs but they may have updated that by the time your reading this. The reason I believe this is the best place to get music is because you can get pretty any song you want for free unlike apple store, and its super easy to find what you want unlike YouTube. This is really great for me to use bc I can just pop on a random playlist and listen to it while I do art or work bc I hate the quiet Anyways this is just my personal preference so go ahead and read some other reviews before downloading it and upload your story about it I really hope that you have as much use of this app as I do. Thanks for reading all of this I know its rly long bye "
"New update. Ive been a huge fan of this app since the beginning &amp; to be honest I will give five star without any doubt. However, recent updates made this app really hard to access, for example one timeall my downloaded songs were deleted for no reason when I was offline, then I had to re-download them then it says saved in my phone but I couldnt access them offline. One more thing is, the app keeps crashing in the middle of a song/podcast that Im listening to"
You need to download. I love this because its has amazing music and lots of songs to play the only problem I find is that u have to have data or WiFi to use it but I love it 
DOWNLOADED SONGS. I wont go back to Apple Music but my ONE request PLEASE I really wish I knew what songs I already have downloaded. Id love a section with all of your songs total that you could shuffle through like Apple music. I dont want a song I already have in another playlist into another one. I have too many songs downloaded to keep track. PLEASE FIX
"Repeated Deletion of my Downloads. Ive used Spotify for years. When I first got it around 2016, it was perfect. I dont use data for it, so the fact that I could download all of my music and have it all in one place was fantastic Then some changes happened gradually that kind of pushed downloads out. There was a removal of the downloads section entirely, forcing me to make a bunch of playlists containing all of my favorite bands repertoires, and downloading those. That quickly was resolved, but now downloads are glitchier than ever. It seems randomly occurring, but Im now on the 4th or 5th time in which everything in my downloads just vanished. I have to go through my library of dozens of albums and individually open them and download again. Its stupid, it shouldnt happen as frequently as it does, and until Downloads gets some more love, its back down to 1 star for me"
Download problems..?. I just updated the app and I now cannot play my downloaded music without my data on which hasnt happened before ever. Im on premium. BUT I can listen to podcasts no problem
"Best streaming music service right now. Really fast, nice looking, with amazing recommendations algorithm. I love it. But please add 3 more features: 1. Lyrics. Just only lyrics. 2. Rating of tracks in the album section  on the desktop this rating is not nice for use; and iphone app is not have it all. I want to know what songs on the album is the best. 3. Just play button for play radio of the tracks I would like. Its called Flow in another app"
Good app. Love the app. Its still incredible just wish if you didnt have premium you could still pick which songs you want on
Great app. Very convenient app other than the fact that I wish they would ask you if you want to remove a track when clicking the heart button because Ive accidentally removed tracks by mistakenly hitting that button
"Easy listening evil corp. They track you and sell your data.Pay podcasters to spread lies, conspiracies, and misinformation. Pay your favorite artists poverty for their work"
"Love, love , love . Love it because you can play any music you with out using any data on trip where there is no internet"
Inconsistent. Used to really love this app but I find it really annoying that they keep putting songs i clearly hate in my daily mixes. Tidal actually keeps the vibe going correctly with its suggested next track. I also gotta ride with my favorite podcast The Joe Budden podcast so this is my last month with this DSP at least until till they figure out a better algorithm
"Its good but could be great. All we want is to be able to change our playlist covers on our phones and not have to go to desktop to do it. Also improve your security, because many of my friends have been hacked. Overall good and you guys have great customer service"
"good. my favorite music app, but my only problems are that you should add a dislike button so that that song doesnt play, and pleasepleaseplease add an option on ads to say i dont care like seriously why havent you done that? perfect opportunity to sell information"
"Playing suggested track. First of I would like to say good the app is by all means, but I dont like how it plays that l have never added to my playlist and most of the time I dont like the songs in the suggested track and it does this repetitively and it is annoying. Even though I have only been a user for 2 years it didnt do that Play Suggested Track"
Better than Apple Music. My personal preference is that it is Better than Apple Music
"Terrible. I used to be able to use this app reliably without paying for a sub. I just couldnt download songs.Now, its the most ad-ridden, unintuitive, user-unfriendly music player Ive ever used"
"Suggestion. I love the app and how it doesnt need much data for on the go, however I have a suggestion. Like for making new playlist out of already existing ones, have a select button that can pick lots of songs at once to quicken the process of picking a song, clicking add to playlist, choosing playlist and doing over and over again for however many songs"
"I cant view the songs on my playlist??. Ive used this app for years and Ive never experienced this issue. I dont have premium so it might be because of that but I think thats absolutely ridiculous to not be able to view songs on your own playlist. My app is up to date and Ive tried refreshing. Also its not only my own personal playlist, its every playlist"
"UI issues. Good app however the way the download button is laid out in playlists, I keep deleting songs by accident leading me to have to re-download playlists with thousands of songs on them. There isnt even a second prompt making it hard to notice until I left the house leading me to have to use up my data to stream the songs"
"Technological difficulties with App. I love the app, but theres currently technological difficulties with WiFi, Bluetooth, or data on/off it only is playing songs for 10 seconds and turns off. It just started this today, and its also not connecting to my tv any longer. I really just need help thats quick and efficient alerts and recommendations when these difficulties come up with a report to fix"
"My go-to app. Pretty much all the positive reviews I nod my head to, and I would like to suggest something for future updates. If theres anyway we could have an analysis feature on personal, custom playlists where theres a genius break down of what that playlist is composed of in regards of genre or year of music. If theres already a feature that does this, let me know  I might just have not seen it yet"
"Worth the money overall. Great app for streaming music, however, the app is notorious for crashing if I have too many tracks in my queue or if I open another app at times - needs updated"
"Keeps Crashing (iPhone). Ive been using spotify for years now and now all of a sudden for the past couple of months everytime i listen to my music with earphones or just out loud from my phone (it never does this when i connect through bluetooth with my alexa) it crashes and restarts the app and i have to keep opening the app back up and re-listening to whatever song was on when the app crashed. This is very annoying, i am not being able to enjoy my music because it keeps cutting off. (App is up to date, phone software is up to date, issue happens on both wifi and cell data, restarting my phone doesnt work either)"
"STOP DELETING MY DOWNLOADS. I downloaded them for a reason. I had over 30 gigs of music downloaded, come back and suddenly 95% of it is gone. I don&#39;t have unlimited data so I rely on downloads to listen to musicon my commute. Please either fix it or add a &#34;download library&#34; option"
"Very nice app but. This app is overall easy to use but I hate that when going to shuffle a playlist it will shuffle a suggested track, this is super annoying and prevents me from listening to my music"
"Updates keep removing and adding in too many features. Really used to love this app ive been paying for it for years now but every so often they release a new update that will remove something ive always liked such as album art next to all of my tracks in a playlist now thats randomly gone and its much harder to find songs im looking for. they recently added in podcasts and now theyre taking up the majority of my front page, i dont listen to many podcasts and when i do i have a completely different app for that, really which i could control a lot more of the viewing methods in the settings, so for now im really dissatisfied with this app"
Annoying. So I dont know what it is but Ive never had an issue with the app till today. Im trying to listen to one song and it skips to another track plays 3-5seconds of a different song then skips again and repeats. Its so frustrating. At first I thought its my phone but clearly theres something wrong with the app
"Not working with WiFi. For some reason today the Spotify app doesnt work. Whenever I open the app it immediately closes. Yet when I open the app without WiFi or data it works because I can listen to my already downloaded songs. Ive restarted my phone (which is up to date on the latest software) uninstalled the app and still it doesnt work. Now that Ive uninstalled the app and installed it again it does the same thing, only I cant listen to my already downloaded songs because I need to log back in...but cant without WiFi. All of my music is on Spotify so I really hope it starts working again soon"
"App shuts down when internet is activated. I switched to this service due to the fact it had more of the content I wanted, but now I cant even use the app with wifi or data on"
Great app. Great app but when I try to play my songs that I have downloaded it will not play them. Even if I used my data or wifi. Some songs will just not play. And yes I have premium
Love love love it. Songs I wanna hear when I wanna hear them. Its like they know me. Hey they probably do. As much spying that is done. Oh well #Trump2020
"Love the app. I love The app, but is eating data up oniPhone 7 Plus"
"30 minutes ad free are bogus. They offer 30 minutes with no ads if you watch a video. Its not one video, its 3 or 4 and I watched my ad block and had ONE track about 2 minutes long and I had another ad"
Closing on its own. Im unable to get through a whole song before the app closes completely and stops playing. Ive dealt with this multiple times but it keeps showing up. My original solution was to delete and redownload the app but this hasnt worked this time. It not only happens when Im streaming music but also when I have my data off and the playlists downloaded
BEST APP ON THIZ PLANT . I love this app so so SOO much I use it almost like 5 times a day u need to download this app it lets u listen to music while on another app and with ur phone off to DOWNLOAD THIS APP 
"Decent streamer - could be so much better. Big library plus new releases.  Lots of playlists and ability to share publicly and with friends.  Playlist suggestions based on my personal playlists etc. Bit fiddly to share the account with family.  No features such as allowing overlap tracks from one to the next. Cant work out how to change the order of tracks on my playlist?  Do I like certain types of music with particular  beat, rhythm etc, yes. So playlists that are made for me doesnt consider it, it seems. So much AI to be applied but I dont see it"
"Wonderful access to music, technical challenges with the queue. I love having access to music not normally heard on UK radio. However I dont like the way the music queue works. Playing a new playlist, the first track plays but then it reverts to the previous unfinished list.  I would expect a new list to either overwrite the old or at least be offered the option"
Will change back when issue is resolved. I had this app for years and all of a sudden I cant play the songs I select (while on WiFi or mobile data.) I pay for premium and the app is up to date. Anyone else having this issue?
"Liked songs. Ive been paying for premium for 6+ years. The one thing I will Willingly pay for monthly. Recently (a month or two) I can only listen to the first 3-10 seconds of my liked songs &amp; then it will not play anymore of that song. It does it when Im using data, when I have WiFi, or when I have zero connection. I cant figure out why its doing this.. but its very frustrating &amp; I cant listen to any music that I save"
Algorithm hell. I subscribed to Premium through PayPal and 4 payments were taken but I never got ad free service nor any offer of money back or resolution to my problem. I had 2 2hr+ back and forth email sessions with the customer support with a barrage of screenshots and automated answers from different support persons. They clearly could not track my payments. I have now cancelled
Cannot use. Tried updating the app due to the inability to use it without wifi-  I was logged out and now I have no access at all. Tried speaking with customer service via your site and got linked to a representative who didnt resolve anything. Youre charging people for a service they cant use
"New update messed up CarPlay. I Have had the app for years and loved it. But latest update messed up CarPlay functionality. My steering wheel and CarPlay screen controls used to work great when scrubbing thru a track. A quick press changes the track. A longer hold Advances  and reverses in 10 second increments, but with the new update its now all choppy and inconsistent. Sometimes jumping 10 and 30 Seconds or even back to the beginning of the track with no logical or predictable pattern. This has to be a bug Theres no way Spotify developers would intentionally botch a feature like this. Hope a fix comes soon Spotify if youd like more info on the issues Im experiencing feel free to reach out"
"practically unusable. I wrote a review before, but now its way different. The app just kinda refuses to work. Anytime I close my phone while the app is still playing something, it would just stop; then after Id go back to turn it back on the app would restart. Id thought that it was because it needed to update, in which I was right. But after letting it update, it would continue with the problem. The only reason I didnt rate it lower, was because I know they can fix the issue"
"My playlist. Listen I love this app, I always use it but there is something I find very annoying. Im trying to listen to my playlist and it goes to a suggested track. Like Ill listen to that if I want to, its really annoying"
" Liked Songs . Ive been using this app for a while now and this problem keeps occurring. Whenever Im listening to my liked songs, it changes to  suggested track . Its quite annoying because when you skip it keeps it on suggest track, not back to liked songs. So you have to listen to the suggest track or just listen to a different playlist. Thanks"
Really good app. This is a very good app. But then again it does eat up my data and thats a downside but otherwise its an amazing app created very well
Interface is fine. This app is very slow even with high speed data and WiFi. A lot of songs arent playing and Im not sure why. Amazon music is okay but much better than this. Also the app doesnt allow deleting recent history. Seriously??
"Layout. love the layout, love the personal mixes of music it does for you, including the new music suggestions it gives FINALLY lets your change your username so now its a 10/10 for me"
"Worst app ever. 0 stars. Used to work now it doesnt even play downloaded songs when I have cell data off, so if I want to listen to music I have to burn all my data and even then it only plays 10 seconds of a song then stops until I close the app and re open it or I skip past 10 seconds in time, if my data runs out which thanks to this app it will then it doesnt play anything or does randomly after like 15 - 20 mins"
"Not working without internet data. Lately the app is not working without internet data  to listen my downloads music, I dont why the songs are not playing before the downloaded songs were playing without internet; and I really need the app working because Im a sailor and most of time when Im working I dont have access to internet so for what Im paying for??Can you gys figure it out please?Thanks"
"Good stuff man. Honestly its just great to use, theres thousands of playlists already made by users with similar tastes to pick and choose your own songs from, and about every second day some new podcast or audio book is being produced, so practically everything you could want as long as you either have wifi, data, or have Spotify premium and downloaded your favourite stuff. Only thing that bugs my is the hella-loud adds in the podcasts and songs. Nothing like listening to smooth jazz and suddenly being assaulted by a pop-song military advertisement.All in all, its a great app, download it or whatever"
"4 Stars. I agree with everyone else who doesnt have premium. Why? This is annoying. 10 skips at least. No suggested tracks or playlist. I dont even understand why you need premium, this app makes alot of money from just people downloading it, no need to make them pay"
Not all songs appear on personal playlist. Added songs to my personal playlist but they dont appear or play in the list and when I try to add them again it says theyve already been added. Annoying and no one seems to have an answer
"Love it, but. The only thing this app needs is a faster way to delete songs off our own playlists. While a song is playing when I want to remove it I have to scroll through my playlist to find the song to remove it. We should have the option to remove it while the song is playing on the playlist. We should also have a search bar in our personal playlists to search for songs in that specific playlist. Last thing is an option to select multiple playlists at a time not just add the one song one at a time. I love everything else about the app"
"review. these songs are lit great service for when your using wifi or data. it loads fast and has amazing tunes to listen to, i recommend "
Download. I constantly have to keep downloading the same playlist. After about a few months I have to re-download all the songs. Unfortunately one time and use the majority of my data to download all the songs again because I did not have Wi-Fi
STOP PLAYING SUGGESTIVE TRACKS. It gets so annoying when Im just trying to play my music and BTS Zoe terrible country or disgusting sex songs come on and I cant change it. I doubt you read these but if you do... PLEASE STOP PLAYING SUGGESTIVE TRACKS
Update is Trash. I mainly use Spotify to listen to lots of different podcasts at work. I work with my hands and cannot easily interact with my phone. I use to download the episodes I wanted to listen to in the morning then just play through them in the downloaded tab. Unfortunately this new update has completely changed how the download tab works. It no longer displays the individual episodes downloaded and instead it displays which podcasts you have downloaded episodes in. I cant just hit play and let it cycle through the episodes. This update has completely ruined my personal listening experience
"Incredible . This app is a lot better than Pandora, SoundCloud,  Apple Music, and I always keeps the songs I play 24/7 on a good rotation"
"Plays same songs. Ten years and it was good now it plays the same exact tracks in each tailored mix and weekly. Plain and simple this is a good product gone bad. Dont keep giving them your money blindly, theres way better services"
Great app. Great app takes little data wish u could play offline tho
Blow your ears away. Music podcasts blah blah. Its the best streaming app Ive used (personal opinion) among all (and Ive used most of the major ones)
"downloading songs doesnt work on apple watch. i was so excited when you guys finally announced that you can download music on the apple watch. unfortunately for me, it doesnt work at all. i disconnected my watch, reset the watch, downloaded spotify again and nothing works. in fact, its even worse. before i tried all of that, at least it would say download 1 out of ___ and never progress. now it says that i havent tried to download anything on the watch even though my phone says that its downloaded to my watch. this is ridiculous"
Apple Watch. Hope soon we have the option to stream on Apple Watch. Would be ideal for long runs without phone
Can't use. iPhone see 2020 and I can&#39;t use at least not on my wireless data. Yes I have tried multiple locations and changes my settings. Yes I have logged out even reinstalled. It gets to 10 seconds of a song and ends. If I can stream a YouTube video why can&#39;t I stream a simple song? That&#39;s wild. My Android was way better with apps than my new iPhone
Glitches. Constant Glitches Songs are not being played when you click on them  Switching to Apple Music if this continues Its been like this for almost a year Songs are only being played when you download them. I have a great wife and data connection
Randomly deletes my downloads. Downloads get randomly deleted and will re download on data unless you have gone into setting and turned it off. Even if youve turned it off its still annoying when youre not on wifi and go to listen to something that is supposed to be downloaded but then see it has been deleted and you need to actually remember to re download it when on wifi
"So frustrating. Its been a week that I cant listen to my songs. I pay for the subscription to be able to listen to my songs offline but they dont even work offline. When I turn on my data to use the app, a few songs will play for 10 seconds and they will stop, while the rest of the songs will not play at all. I gave it a couple of days but no changes. Not even when I use another device or use the web. Extremely frustrating, such a great app but it has been really messing with my mood"
"A few things. The algorithm is fantastic and has helped me find some incredible music, but the amount of bugs in this app has always got me considering Apple Music. Constantly having to redownload or force close the app can be frustrating for an app meant to run in the background"
"Download disappointment. Lets not cut it short, I love the app.  I have been a premium user since the beginning.  Im even a investor. However, as of late Ive been extremely disappointed in the download function of the app. Ive had my downloads repeatedly removed from my device and have caused in additional data usage when music should already be on my device (esp. when updating the app).  And, now I cannot even download my playlists"
"It used to be great, gone downhill lately. Love this app but lately it&#39;s fine to crap. Cant add songs to my playlist, it crashes my app, podcasts don&#39;t track across apps well. And now 50% if the time the music doesn&#39;t even play. Sup Apple music"
It went down the hill. It use to work perfectly fine but now whenever I switch off my data or WiFi the already downloaded songs wont play anyway which is very frustrating
My personal rating. Makes the music sound a lot better especially with the beats and no commercials which is even better and free ap
"Graciousgr8ness. Great App, but some albums that I listen to are no longer available. Probably due to legal action between record labels, recording artists and/or other parties. On a whole the app is available on multiple platforms. Premium version is marvellous but the free version stops tracks when Im listening to themvery disappointing(as I had to downgrade mainly for Christmas and coz of Covid)"
Great app. The music is nice and I enjoy the personal playlists. The app recently started to kick me out constantly and Im considering waiting for the next update or changing music streams
"small glitch?. this app is fire, but i think theres sum going on where we cant see track pictures and its not that big of a deal but if that could get fixed soon, that would be amazing"
"Preferred Music App, Still Has Its Issues. Why cant we see the song lyrics of every song rather than a select few? Also let us add a song to multiple playlist in one go. Its very annoying to go through process of adding a song to each singular playlist when you want to put it in two or four. The shuffle program yall have for our personal playlists is terrible, it plays the same songs even if you reshuffle multiple times"
Watch endless ads. Nothing but ads between most if not all tracks. Unless you want to pay I wouldnt bother. Sell out. 
This is great ima just let you know what your getting info. The is a great app there are podcasts about storys for kids and adults this app is for all ages and you can do on thing and still hear music you you can also make a playlist and its for FREE this app can help you have music for live streams animations and just for your own personal things spotifiey also gives you 30 minutes with out adds if you watch one add this app is not just great but amazing
Loading problem FIX ASAP. Fix the loading on downloaded songs when Im out on the road there a lot of songs that I cant listen too at all when Im on the road I shouldnt have to turn on my data to make it load faster  I havent had issues with this in 2018-2019 fix this issue ASAP do that I will rate this app a 5star
Music keeps cutting out. Ive had premium for almost three years now but whenever I play music is stops at 6 seconds? Its so annoying and even if my songs are downloaded they wont work unless Im connected to WiFi/data which defeats the whole purpose of premium fix this pls its so annoying
App just crashes. App sometimes crashes when the mobile data is on and there is around 10 seconds left on the song
Great App. Never have a problem with connectivity even on data. App is easy and user friendly. Use it everywhere I go
This is my review its 9 words long. I love it just wish it didnt need data
I dont understand all the fuss. This app is just... ok. I dont actually like the playlists picked based off the artists I like (most of the music isnt at all similar/doesnt fit) but thats a personal preference i guess.My biggest complaint is that the app on my iPhone quits on me after roughly 30 minutes of listening. Ive done all the troubleshooting and it only works for about a week before it goes back to quitting.This wouldnt be a huge issue normally except that the reason I downloaded the app was to build a playlist for running. I dont like running without music so when it suddenly quits playing mid run its such a bummer.But I love using it for podcasts and its been great for that. Just not a huge fan of the music selections and the app is super buggy
The best. This is the best app and you can have all the songs you want but one thing I dont like you need wi-Fi and data for it
"New Update is BUNS. In the Artists tab it changed from just showing the songs youve saved to the whole artist page. I liked having the songs I CHOSE not every Deluxe or Live version of the same album. Im a student and if I were to shuffle, there is now no guarantee that I would get a song Ive downloaded, so half the time I would have to skip because the reception in schools are terrible. That last one was just a personal problem, but I bet someone is on the same boat. App was amazing up until now, Please Fix "
Playlists for days Best for podcasts. I dont know why it took me so long to start using Spotify. It is by far superior to all other music and podcast streaming services. The workout playlists are awesome and Im able to keep track of all my favorite podcasts without having to subscribe to them
Need Apple Watch Downloaded Music Support. This app will get 5 stars when I can play downloaded music on my Apple Watch
"Amazing. Ive had this app for years now Its always reliable, and its sound quality is amazingEven though I have to use my mobile data to listen to music because I dont have premium its worth it. It also gives you the option to create as many playlists as you want and even gives you a small description about each artist. Also it also creates playlists for you e.g all of your likes songs, the songs you have been listening to the most and the ones you listened to the most last year. Its amazing I would 100% recommended downloading it"
"How do I stop the suggested songs. BRO I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO MY MUSIC BUT NO IM GONNA BUT SOME RANDOM TRACK I DONT CARE, but its pretty good not gonna lie"
"Not a podcasting app. When I stream a podcast Why oh why am I forced to stream the video? I dont want the video, its a podcast. It kills my data and my battery. Such a simple thing that needs to be fixed"
"Idk why my app keeps crashing and downloaded songs wont play with Lte and offline. Hey Spotify, I was wondering if you can help me figure out how my app is crashing all the time and when downloaded songs I play in my likes and playlist dont wanna play everyday. Ive tried deleting my app and reinstalling it and deleting data to see if that would work but it didnt. I dont know what to do Ive run out of options. Thank you for taking the time to read this"
Great. Im always using this app way better than YouTube  rarely any adds if u have listened to the song u can turn the song on and put it onto replay and turn ur phone and WiFi off or data I love this app make a playlist as long as u want
"Constantly crashes. It&#39;s great for free music. But the app constantly crashes. This happens after a phone restart and even after fully uninstalling the app and it&#39;s data and reinstalling. I&#39;ve only been using the app for the past 6 months and it&#39;s been a constant problem.I&#39;ve tried submitting the crash logs from my phone to Spotify support but they don&#39;t quite do anything with it. Seems to be related to the app using too much processing for an extended period of time (90 seconds?).Additionally the app offers the ability to skip ads for 30 minutes if you watch a video but that&#39;s a straight up lie.It&#39;s a shame because if the app actually functioned and didn&#39;t crash I might be inclined to pay for it. Instead, I&#39;m looking at other potential alternatives. I guess for a free service it&#39;s perhaps hard to complain but if you pay for it is recommend looking elsewhere. Not sure if this app issue happens on other platforms but it&#39;s a common issue if you search around"
Mad. Never plays tracks when you click on them if this isnt fixed Im canceling my membership
Apple Watch stream download. Need ability to download music to watch so we can exercise without phone on us. Download and stream to headphones for Apple Watch that doesnt have LTE. Thats key
Love it. I use it this app everyday to listen to music. Helps me set the vibe for the work day.  But lately I will start the app and use it for some time after a short period of usage I will occasionally get 10-15 seconds into a song and the app will quit. When I restart the app choose a song it will continue to do it. I am not sure why I am not on wi-fi and I pay for unlimited data like a giga chad. Its a little irritating but otherwise I like the app when I can use it for extended periods of time with out having to uninstall and reinstall the app because that helps the problem
"songs skip. i used to adore this app would use it all day everyday no matter what i was doing. but for the past few months almost every song stops at 10 seconds or just doesnt play at all. i have premium but even though i have the songs downloaded they dont play unless i am connected to wifi or have my data on, which is frustrating to say the least as i pay for premium so it should work instead of me having to constantly use my data for it to work. the only time it seems to work without stopping is when i have it playing through my amazon echo dot. my mum, dad and sister do not seem to have this problem but i do and i hope there is some way to fix this"
"Download this RIGHT now. This app is amazing from whether you want podcasts, albums, or singles its great. You can pair your account with a PSN account in order to listen to music while youre playing on the ps4. The only criticism I have for the app are the suggested tracks which will interrupt whatever your listening to to play whatever it wants"
Not every track you want. Theres a lot of tracks that are not on this app
My SESSION STOPPED. When I started to listen to music the sound track stopped and the app closes by itself. I cant not use it bc of that
DONT download this app its a scam. I downloaded this app for FREE use couple of months ago and now the app was trying to charge me multiple times which was rejected and i have logged to my account with them to check whether my account was free or premium and it is still free then it means that this app steals your credit cards information and try to charge you.. Please note i have not saved any bank details or account details in this app at all
Cant Open Full Album. When I was going to album today by someone else I wanted to see all of the tracks that were on it. So I tried to hit and more so I could see the rest of the tracks. And it wouldnt let me. I have tried to uninstall Spotify and re-downloaded but it still didnt work. I also tried on other albums and they didnt work either
"Advertisement. There is an advertisement where it says you couldve listened to an eight track tape, if you knew what an eight track tape looked like. Jokes on you lady because I do so stop assuming otherwise"
"Bugs. I love it, but I have been experiencing bugs for a while that Id expect from a much less well-established app. When I go to play from an artist directly from their page, it will say its playing, but nothing will show up and nothing will play. Sometimes it will say it has skipped and then play the previous song again. The biggest one that bothers me the most is how it interacts with data. I have a bad data plan so I have everything downloaded. When on data, instead of fetching all downloads first,  it will try to refresh and get new things from my slow data and I have to turn off data to see a playlist quickly. I really wish it would do that in the opposite order"
"annoying issue. so im a premium user and i have songs downloaded and so i was having issues with some of my songs. its the same ones too it isnt random and they just dont play at all and i cant get them to, ive tried literally everything i reset my phone my app is up to date and i even tried turning off my data and wifi just in case my internet was slow but it just doesnt work thinking of canceling my subscription and using a different music app please fix this"
"Flawed, but does the job. Its a great app other than two things:1) If youre in an area of weak signal or slow wi-fi, the app takes an age to open and go to your album of choice, even when you just want to play something youve downloaded and saved to your phone. Were talking several minutes, even on the latest iPhone. The only way round the problem is to switch to aeroplane mode, go to what you want to hear, them switch off plane mode to switch Bluetooth on to hear the music. Ive been doing this hack now for years and I dont think theyll ever sort it. Annoying. Ive spoken to support but just get ignored, or mid-understood (they always think Im trying to stream music).2) Theres a massive play shuffled button on an albums screen, but no normal play button for those of us who want to hear an album with the tracks in the right order. You need to tap on a track to play it, and the next track will follow. BUT When you do this, the play with shuffle button flips to a big pause button, but if you tap it to unpause, it goes to shuffle mode and immediately changes the track. Terrible GUI design"
"needs to be better. first and foremost, needs to pay artists at a better and fairer rate..then basic issue w the app:often doesnt play tracks unless liked.sometimes wont load/play track.loading of searches etc. can take an age, even if w good internet connection.poor representation of collaborative artists on track names.album details could be much more comprehensive.classical music info is very poor, searches for specific interpretations are difficult"
"To many ads. Amazing app, incredible songs and artists, however I seem to be getting more ads then music"
"Get rid of the Rogan podcast. He spreads false, damaging information"
". It was good at the beginning, but after that; No no no The app kick me out all the time, I can&#39;t listen to music, it doesn&#39;t matter if I close the app and then I refresh the data on my cell phone and it doesn&#39;t work anyway.  I always decide on Pandora or YouTube. After a long time I try again and it works for a while and then it stops working, it always does the same"
hacked account. someone keep taking over my account while im using it and its very annoying
Love this app. Yooooo people seeing this read it... This is truly the best app for listening to your favorite artists... If you like hip hop I prefer NLE Choppa or x and Juice. But if you want to listen to your favorite artists instead of looking them up like SoundCloud or Apple Music you can just follow them and you well got notified when they drop a new track or album. Get this app if you enjoy listening to music :)
"Interesting app. Very interesting easy to use, but algorithm formula needs some tweaking as the same songs keep playing on shuffle mode, To the point where I forget about other songs that are on the playlist. But over all very good especially that you can set the quality of song to allow lower usage of your data"
Data Saver. How can I send a review when I just turned it on? Feel free to check back in a few days  Thx for the heads upBarbie
Fix this or Im cancelling all my subscriptions. Ive been a client for at least a decade and have multiple subscriptions I pay for and I cant get through a two minute song without this app crashing. Ive tried EVERYTHING short of deleting all my phones data (which Im not doing) yall need to fix this mess or Im going back to Apple or Tidal
Apple Watch. App not giving me the option to download music to my Apple Watch
Love this music service. Most incredible inventory of songs and so easy to use
"YOU ARE DISGUSTING. After getting a link THE I iPhone jumps from browser to appStore back and forth COUNTLESSLY, you damn rats Made the most disgusting loop ever, why you exist to make such raw inventions clueless which i smashed one phone due to your nonsense annoying wasted time in the digital world On top theres no BACK button for tracks and by NO WAYS is possible to listen the song desired"
"Stop suggesting tracks in a playlist. No matter what playlist I try and play, even my liked songs, it keeps adding random suggested tracks Im listening to a certain album for a REASON I dont want the random songs. Starting to look elsewhere for my music, this is a huge annoyance"
"annoying playlist problem. i dont like the fact that i cant click on playlists. when i look up a song, and it shows me the playlist its in, it doesnt let me see the rest of the playlist, which gets extremely annoying. i noticed that it is now happening with my own, personal playlists. i added the wrong song to my playlist, then went to remove it, but i cant click on the playlist. now, i have to wait for the song play when i shuffle, remove it, then waste one of my 6 skips"
Not a bad app. Takes a while to get used to but love the daily playlist selection based on what youve listened to previously. Like the fact you can add a track to your playlist as you hear it. Not bad for a free app
"I think I have been hacked. I will be listening to music on my phone on a playlist that I have created and all of a sudden I will be on a playlist I have never heard of or ever even listened to(its also in a different language) I haves given anyone my password or any sort of information to where they could login without me putting the information in manually. I have also changed my password completely(made it longer and used numbers) and it worked for many a week, but it has started up once again. It is the same playlists as last time too, I really wish if someone could help me in any way possible"
"The only app. where I think to myself, I cant wait to use this again in ten yearsFor realthe Year in Review was enough to keep me as a lifer.The Decade in Review completely blew my mind. Not just a reshuffle from Years, but a full on deep dive into my own personal secret songs list.It was crazy. I cant wait to hear the 2nd cut"
"Bugs??. Ive been trying to figure it out for while but for some reason the app no longer allows me to use it with data or wifi on, is anyone else having this problem?? "
"Love. Super organized, easy to use, makes personal playlists for you, aside the ones you make yourself The absolute best You can also change how you want the music to sound (bass etc) as long as you go through settings :)"
"Im upset. I pay you guys every month for premium. So why is it that I cant play any of my downloaded music. And before you ask, yes I have tried all the hacks and everything. But when Im offline its saying I havent downloaded any music, but then when it says downloaded at the top I see all my albums Ive downloaded but then nothing plays. Why am I paying you guys if I cant even listen to music offline? If I knew this was an issue I wouldnt have been you guys please fix this and contact me"
Stop omg. How do i make it stop playing the suggested track? I want to listen to my liked songs not the suggested track thingy omg
"Best music app ever. The best music application ever I use it every single day, it is my personal radiolove it"
Takes forever to play downloaded music. Its a good app with all the music I like but it takes forever to load music even when its downloaded. I downloaded my music so i wouldnt have to rely on WiFi or data but it still thinks it has to load
PLEASE FIX THIS. It is a great app but it constantly shuts off when Im listening to music Im always connected to WiFi or using my data and it still shuts off
"It works but not well. Been a premium subscriber for a few years now and Im about ready to leave for good. Main reason: over my time as a premium subscriber I have made many playlists. I choose to download some of them to my phone so I can access when Im out of cell coverage areas. Only problem is some playlists keep getting un-downloaded some how. I thought I was forgetful the first couple DOZEN times but I have realized that its not me. So be ware, if you are looking at premium to take your music on the go... what ever you download may not go with you"
amazing. Its Just the BEST when you can shut off your Device and it still Plays Plus your can make your own Track of songs That will never go away 
Stop trying to burn data. Constantly crashes lately trying to connect to the network when Im playing offline music. Starting to get annoying
I mean its great. Cant get much better then spofify. Platinum is so nice but without it its still good. Almost any song for free any time anywhere. I know this sounds like an add but its actually just perfect. The personal playlists it sets up for you is rly nice too
"Thank you for offering both Offline and Streaming to the Apple Watch. Thanks Offline still not available for my personal device (why the slow roll out?), so will move up to 5 stars once I get it"
Dumb app. Hate it cus it don lemme skip the track
"App Crashes. The app is crashing every time I open a new song, or when I lock the screen (even when data saver is off)the music good and the app is Stupid"
"Bugs. Good but cant access track listings on the app right now. Like I go to an album from a band, tap see more to look at track listing and it wont open.And of course Id like to be able to do a membership through the app but thats not major so....please fix the track issue it makes it really hard to make playlists right now"
"Just one issue. I have a playlist I keep for myself that I have downloaded, but its very easy to just accidentally click a button and everything is just instantly unsaved from my phone. Now, while this is not a huge issue for most people, its only a problem for me because that playlist is over 100 hours, so it takes forever to redownload it, making it very unfortunate for me since it takes forever and my cellular data is shotty so I have to use WiFi. Please make it harder to undownload it"
Get rid of Joe Rogan. False info news dangerous
"Good app but has issues. This app is pretty ok, you can listen to a playlist of all your favorite songs. However when you listen for a bit the music cuts off and you need to go back into the app to play it again. But my biggest problem with this app is that it starts to okay a suggested track during your music and it doesnt stop playing until you delete the app and re download it"
"Cool app but annoying. The music plays fine and has a very wide selection but sometimes it would randomly stop and restart the app and my song. Also, the suggested tracks are so annoying. I end up using all of my skips and I can&#39;t get back to my music. I had to make another playlist with the same songs because I couldn&#39;t get back to my music and they constantly played suggested tracks"
"Works mostly. Ive trued repeated to download the song Collide by Howie Day, it just wont, my phone says its waiting to download, even though I have unlimited data, and wifi access, there should be NOTHING stopping it from downloading, but it wont download, its set to download off data, but it is outright refusing to, so here we are, 3 stars"
"The reason why my homework is getting done. I live the app, I really do but I think if there was a feature to get lyrics from the app,  that would be useful.  Im always having to go on google and finding the lyrics which I find a little annoying when Im using my data, lots of love"
"Its Sprint service disguised as Verizon. This service, more importantly the speed, is downright atrocious even with having full bars on LTE or 5G Im not a heavy data user, other than using Maps for work every day. Other than the price this service is WORTHLESS. Make no mistake Its Sprint disguised as Verizon It will take you 30 seconds just to load something like maps or any streaming apps. VOIP calls get dropped constantly, or at best, a major lag and delay  I reached out to tech-support, and thats the only time your speeds are boosted to what its supposed to be. The minute you hang up with tech-support, the speed goes back down to less than a 1mbps. What a joke Cant wait for this month to be over so that I may switch to a real Verizon service. Fool me once I guessRead the critical reviews to see what the biggest gripe is with this dial-up of a service"
Apple Watch Connect. There is no option for downloading music to my apple watch when online it says there should be. disappointed
"Wow incredible. Apple songs is good, sound cloud is ok. But looking and useing this app is just incredible With this app you can listen to many good songs out there including many video game themes From Hard core rock to metal this app is a must have. Not only is the app free but you can actually use it and hear many great songs. After using this app you can get a subscription to this app. What really made me go to this app is the ability to play on Xbox one, yup you can listen to your favorite songs and play your game at the same time, best of all you can control music from your cell. I am planning on getting the premium account. Thank you Maybe we can get this on Nintendo switch?10/10"
a DJ in your phone. Great service.  Why buy loads of CDs when you can download from so many old and new tracks?
"AN INCREDIBLE APP. This app is the upmost amazing music app to date. Yes, premium may be a drag for a lot of people especially during this pandemic but for only $11.99 per month (Australian) it is 100% worth it. No ads, unlimited skips and high auto makes the music on this app really pop. I would highly recommend this app"
Deserves 5 stars. What can I say? Its pretty much free music. Its got all types of styles of music and you can make your own personal playlist ofc. You can pay for premium and there are no adds but if you dont thats fine you just have ads in between. But overall great app and I love it
keeps crashing when you put it on mobile data. IT KEEPS CRASHEING WHEN I PUT IT ON MOBILE DATA AND I HAVE ALREADY HAD A STRESSES MORNING DO NOT RECCOMEND TERRORBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD I ALMOST THREW MY IPAD OUT THE CAR WINDOW AND I TRIED DELETING THE APP AND IT DIDNT WORK ITS TERROBLE IT MADE ME STRESSED
Offline listening. You should be ably to listen without Wi-Fi/ data
Disappointed. The user interface needs work. Deleting played podcasts doesnt appear to be an option. I burned through my data in two days because there is no way to disable podcast video. Cmon guys you got this....lets fix these simple issues
Some problems. The download sometimes will not play with out WiFi even when I have premium plz fix I love play music with no WiFi of data
"Obnoxious podcast popups. Premium subscription still results in ads bothering you when youre trying to start up a music playlist.Also, never in my life have I hit the previous track button and wanted to start a song over. Maybe if Im like 10 seconds away from the end of the song then yes"
"Wonky when connecting to Bluetooth devices. When connected to my car the time stamp often gets out of sync. I may skip forward in my car and then if I skip forward from my phone it doesnt know I ever moved forward from my cars controls and now Im behind 20 minutes on the podcast. Then it forces an ad even though I pay for premium and I skip forward through the ad and then it skips to the next question up track even though Im only halfway through the podcast. Then I go back to that episode and it starts me from the beginning and when I try to skip forward it hits me with the ads gain and again. Now from here out I cannot properly control or play the episode. Im out my car and and trying to pause or play from my phone just skipped me to the last few seconds of the podcast again. Time to find my place againAlso 1 star for being creepy and tracking me using personal information. Thanks apple for at least forcing transparency here, how about blocking that creepiness now?"
Annoying. Ever since the new update my music has been stoping halfway through the track and Ive not been able to pick certain songs from my playlist to play. This is frustrating and id like it if you fixed it. Its not anything to do with my wifi because I am on 4 bars of 4G and its still stoping midway through. So fix it
"Hackers.. not secure. Good selection, easy to use. But literally once a week my account gets hacked. So I either have to make a new account with all my payment info etc, or constantly change my password, either way I lose my playlists weekly"
Worst podcast interface Ive ever seen. Ive subscribed to the Joe Rogan Experience on Apple Podcasts/iTunes for many years. Literally the only reason Im using Spotify at all is JRE.  I dont think Ill be doing that anymore. Im not interested in eating my mobile data and my battery on video streams of every show. I want to just download the audio for off-line listening
"UI change. The most recent UI update with the album art on songs in playlist view makes the app horribly slow. It now takes 2-3 seconds for me to view a playlist. I understand that it increases visual similarity around the app but it simply makes spotify more confusing to navigate. This album art is also a wasting my precious little data. Please implement a toggle for simple and fancy playlist view, I can barely use the app right now"
"Song titles truncated. Good app. The only major problem is that track titles are truncated, especially on a phone or iPod. This means its hard to find the track in an album you are aiming for when they all start with the same words, eg with some operas where all tracks start with opera name, conductor, orchestra and thats all you see"
Impossible to cancel subscription. Dont sign up unless you want to spend hours trying to cancel your membership when you decided you want to discontinue Sick of being charged 12$ a month because I cant unsubscribe from the app Had to visit there online website from my laptop and spend a long time tracking down my log in details just fo cancel payments For the #1 music app should be much easier to cancel payment
Quality and availability of tracks. Its a mush have app for song lovers .. easy to use
"Great app BUT. Its a good app but I know what an 8 track tape looks like. If you know, you know. Please disable this ad. Its kinda annoying"
Watch app is useless. It needs to support downloading songs onto the watch so I can listen while working out without carrying my phone
I love it. It a great thing to listen to if you want privacy
"Really good app. It is a music app that is good even without premium. You can find your music very easily, make many playlists for each of your moods, and it very surprisingly makes incredible suggestions for music youd like. Not only that, but premium is 10000% worth the buy. Its affordable and everything. And buying the family plan makes it incredibly worth it. I listen to a lot of music is by far the best app to do it"
"Intentionally Crashes. This app wants to monitor you constantly.  If you like to save your mobile data and rely on downloads or only use with wi-fi, this app will mess up your phone constantly.  This app has temper tantrums.  Dont bother"
"Downloading a podcast episode forever blocks the video. The music part of the app is fine, but if youre using it to watch a podcast theres a HUGE flaw in the design. If youre about to go on a drive where your signal could be patchy or youre trying to save on data charges, its nice to have the option of downloading episodes ahead of time, but you dont want to save hours worth of video. Problem is, when you download a podcast as audio only, you are forever blocked from viewing the video version of that episode. You cant get the video version back even if you delete the download or change your settings to not download episodes as audio only. This is especially frustrating for a show like the Joe Rogan Experience, where you cant view the videos anywhere else. Sometimes theyre describing a relevant graphic or a video clip, but youre stuck with just the audio version"
Amazing app just one thing. Its a great app you can listen to different music and find your new favorites creat play lists that you can shuffle through but you have to be on data to do this unless you have premium. Other than having to have premium to not use WiFi its a great app and good for little kids because the parents can manage and restrict music so good app but for maximum usage you have to have premium so I give it a five star
not playing songs. idk what but recently its only been playing songs for like 6 seconds and then stopping and it has to have data on to play songs ive already downloaded
"Not worth it. The app crashes mid song, and four adds in a row. Premium doesnt fix the crashing and music quality isnt boosted, and not worth downloading songs with how little data it uses to play them especially if your paying for it"
"App could be better. Two issues with app interface: 1. playlists used to show their track count; now the track count isn&#39;t even available in the playlist details viewitself 2. when connected to the car Bluetooth, the app used to show the playlist position of the current track; now for some reason it shows the position of the track in its corresponding album rather than in the playlist. Who the hell needs that? The count is all over the place for no reason. Please fix it Thanks"
"ISTG IF I DONT GET MY 1000+ SONGS BACK IVE HAD SINCE 2019. ive tried all the tips ive been given and yet it still hasnt worked ALL DAY. if i dont get this resolved by the time i wake up tomorrow im done, im so sick of loosing all my data. i better get at least a month free for this inconvenience"
Outstanding. Selection of music and ease of use is incredible. Love the app Love the free service
"Bruh. The app always randomly crashes and requires a reset, which is incredibly annoying for someone who works and is away from their phone. A way to delay this for a short time is to switch to a different playlist and then switch back. Another issue I have is with the suggested songs. I dont want to listen to songs that have nothing to do with the music I normally listen to. And it uses up all 6 of my skips and its really annoying. Please fix your app and make a setting for suggested tracks"
"Finally History on Mobile. Thank God. They finally added a history tab on mobile. I no longer have to tap previous track to see what I was listening to, and then realize it switched playlists so I cant even find the song. Now weve got a recently played tab with all the past played songs. Please never take this feature off mobile. Ive been waiting years for this. Hopefully they read these reviews"
Great but not. So ive been thinking and they should make it so you can listen offline. I also get alot of ads. I recommend this if you have data on your phone/ipad. But if you dont  i wouldnt recommend it
"Highly Recommend. I love this app, it lets you easily stream pretty much any song you can think of and the podcast section has really expanded recently. I had the free version for about a year and a half and would strongly recommend it. It is one of the few apps with a free option that isnt complete crap and the only reason I upgraded was because I had a cheap data plan and wanted to be able to download more content. I also have grown to love that my upgraded account comes with Hulu, and ever since I got it I have actually deleted Netflix since I really like Hulus tv shows. Anyway, get this app, its the real deal and its great for anyone without a lot of money"
Cant view playlists. I cant see the songs I chose on my personal playlists or other playlists
My personal opinion. So much better on Apple Music
STOP DELETING MY DOWNLOADS. Instead of focusing on your stupid little covid banners all over the place fix podcast downloads. Id like to listen to the things I download until theyre finished without wasting data while Im away from wifi but that seems impossible in recent weeks. Instead my downloads have been magically disappearing and cant be redownloaded for whatever reason
Downloaded music disappears. Constant battle trying to keep downloaded music on your deviceGreat selection and recommendations in YVR app but if the songs do not download so you dont use to use data what is the point of this app?Fix this
"Downloaded music wont play offline. I just updated my iPad to iPadOS 13.5.1 since doing this update my downloaded music wont play offline if I connect to internet the song will start to play I can then disconnect and listen to the whole song tho if I go to a different song and then come back to this original one it wont play again until I connect to the internet, we live remote and only have cellular data so we dont really want to have to delete all of our music  and download it again and we dont have service much either and Spotify music is such a saviour for us out here hopefully you might be able to sort this out with an update or a trick that might work for us cheers guys"
App ~ song history. Need to see a 50 or 50+ track song history with the app
Omg worth the price. Best music quality I prefer this better than Pandora and Apple Music its so nice so I would recommend you get premium unless you have unlimited data
Disappointed. Downloaded for the Elon musk JRE podcast after refusing to for a couple months after Joes transfer to Spotify. The video format it garbage. The videos and audio become looped during long podcasts seemingly for no reason. Probably because you guys are a music app and dont have the servers to keep watch time memory data for a 3 hour podcast. Give us back JRE
"major bugs and glitches. great app, has all the music in one place with good sound quality. however ive noticed that as soon as i got premium, when playing a song literally after 20 seconds it would glitch and shut down the app. i would open again and then after ten seconds in a different song it would do the same thing. i used mobile data instead of wifi- same thing. shut down my device and turned it on again- same thing. ive noticed that a lot of people are having this issue and ive actually started using youtube because spotify is getting so damn annoying. please fix this bug, as a frequent music listener, i have songs playing for at least 3 hours a day- daily- and it makes it very unenjoyable to have to close the app that youve PAID for out of frustration because it wont play your music for longer than 30 seconds without glitching, and be forced go to a different platform"
Shuts down constantly. During my free trial of premium there were no problems.  Now that the free trial is over - the app constantly just shuts itself down mid song and I have to restart it all over again. Using Iphone 11 and unlimited data so it shouldnt be a problem
"Cant Download Tracks to My Apple Watch. Its good, only when you have premium really, but Im very disappointed that I cant download it to my watch. It says you can on their website but that option isnt there for me.It would be casj if you could add a feature to notify me if someone is about to release a new single or album. Maybe there is already Im not sure"
"Music lover. I find this app an incredible joy to use. It allows me to try new things, as well as listen to old favorites. Highly recommended.  However, providing lossless quality is long overdue"
"Very glitchy. The app will often times stop playing, or refuse to start playing. There are privacy issues with it, and even when the app is not on or running in the background itll still play music to my car radio and the only way to control it is to turn off Bluetooth. Pausing will not work, shutting the app down will not work.They also have no standards when it comes to what they allow to broadcast. Its not a horrible app, but there is so much room for improvement"
"Better than Pandora but still bad. Constantly stops while music is playing and doesnt resume from where it left off, way too expensive for premium and cant play specific tracks"
STOP. STOP PLAYING A SUGGEST TRACK WHEN I WANT MY LIKED PLAYLIST. I just wanted to play my liked not suggested SO STOP WITH THE SUGGESTED TRACK ITS SO BAD TOO
Why. So many ads so that I really want to upgrade but I dont want to use money. It said 30 minutes of ad free music after watching the ad and listening to 1 song it plays 3 other adds for no reason. I also turned off auto play and it still gives me suggested tracks so I need to use my skips. I searched up every to stop giving me suggested tracks but none of them work. Please fix this problem
Daydreams so far. Im having no trouble at all its been smooth sailing so far Though it might be different for others since i have unlimited data. Its free and simple to use.I would recommend it to my friends and family
At your finger tips. Incredible variety of music choice to suit every passion and every moment.  No more records or CDs or USB.  One place for all time.  Wow
Update idea. I would love to be able to change the cover photo of my personal playlists. I do not have a laptop so Im not able to do this
Family package. As a family we can only listen to one persons music at a time. Two people cannot simultaneously use it and listen to different tracks. Kind of pointless having a family package
"Awful Now. Used to be my main source of music.  Used to be a wonderful app.  Used to actually play songs in my playlist.Now, the app only plays two songs (at most) in my playlist and plays suggested tracks until the end of time.  I just want to listen to my playlist  And, no, my playlist isnt less than 12 songs, nor is it over.  I just made a new one with 40+ songs, and after two it plays a suggested trackVery frustrating, and Ive tried everything.  Turning off autoplay, redownloading it, everything the internet said, I tried.Please just let me listen to my songs, and then the suggested tracks.  If I wanted to listen to listen to the suggested tracks, I wouldve listened to them normally"
This is the best. This is the best app ever weve been spying a lot and this is great to listen to when were not so keep um the good work I also sent u a email to
"Good with music, Clunky with podcasts. I really liked the app for music. Nice follow feature and suggestions for the list.  Wish it didnt flake out so much and always want a data connection. I only connect via wi-finals save my lists. I love the LPN network and probably wouldnt   use it for podcasts if it wasn&#39;t exclusive.  It cant remember your filter settings and wont auto delete the played podcasts to free up space.  Has a long way to go in functionality in this realm"
"Suggested track. I love this app but your new update I find so irritating, I dont want you to play a suggested soundtrack and I try turning it off but it doesnt do anything this app was great and all until you added some crappy update to it. I want to know how to turn it off"
"Random pauses. When I would be listening to music, the song would randomly pause, causing me to replay the song all over again. Restarting the song all over again would make the song play again. If I paused and unpaused, no sound would come out of the track. It gets really annoying because if Im not near my phone, i have to go all the way to it so I can restart the song/track. Besides that, the app is great"
Watch app slow and unresponsive. I find the Apple Watch app of Spotify so slow and unresponsive. It quite often needs multiple presses to change tracks. The volume control on the watch crown lags so much its better off not being used. Maybe its my old watch (series 2) or my old iphone (6) but the Apple Music app works flawlessly. The Spotify one is so frustratingly slow
Most is great. The only complaint is the information does not appear in landscape if you turn phone on its side
great app but one thing. STOP PLAYING THE SUGGESTED TRACK. ITS NOT WHAT IM TRYING TO LISTEN TO
JRE. I just want to listen. To JRE not share that much info about me. Also only got this crap app for JrE and it was difficult to login and now I cant watch the podcast. Btw I dont want to watch it I want to just listen. Im glad for Joe but not a fan of Spotify
"Better segregation of followed, recently played and personal. Within my library separate the playlists I follow, those Ive recently played, and the ones I created. Or add a filter at least because right now, that playlist tab under my library is a mess"
I love it. I can use it without WiFi or data and I love it over all
"Not good. I dont like having to watch a 30+ second ad in 4K resolution wasting my data only to not hear the song I want. I dont like this app, its unreliable and never plays what I want"
"Trash app. Crashes constantly, doesnt keep track of where you stopped listening to a podcast, just pulling up the app from the backround is too much for this trash app to handle. Id rather steal than pay .01 for this crap"
"Bugs. I love it, but I have been experiencing bugs for a while that Id expect from a much less well-established app. When I go to play from an artist directly from their page, it will say its playing, but nothing will show up and nothing will play. Sometimes it will say it has skipped and then play the previous song again. The biggest one that bothers me the most is how it interacts with data. I have a bad data plan so I have everything downloaded. When on data, instead of fetching all downloads first,  it will try to refresh and get new things from my slow data and I have to turn off data to see a playlist quickly. I really wish it would do that in the opposite order.02/24/2021: I appreciate some of the fixes that have been made, and I really like some of the newer features that make it easier to use. So far, with this new update, I haven&#39;t experienced the previous bugs:)"
"Adds. This app is great but, having to buy premium to get rid of adds is annoying. But other than that great app do download if like music"
"Best Music App Out There. This app is incredible. Ive been using it for the past few years and it has never let me down. It has lots of features. The more you listen, the more the app recognizes your tastes and creates playlists for you. These playlists change all the time so its never just the same old thing. You can also make your own playlists and add all of your favorite music. You can even make these playlists collaborative so you can make playlists with your friends or let others contribute to your playlists. You can also private them at any time to hide them from others. Even without the premium subscription, this app is amazing for work or school. Highly recommend"
Seamless experience. Moving from one device to the next is seamless as your track in an album is remembered. Love the app
"Absolutely love it but. Please just add the ability to basically copy and paste any playlists. I wouldnt mind having to rename the new playlist or even putting a limit on the amount of playlists you can have. Id be superbly happy with 5 amazing personal playlists and all your premade ones. That said, this is literally my most used app. Its beautiful. Even after updates and changing the user interface theyre still killing it. I dont use any other music source these days and havent even thought of pandora in years. Download this. Youve wasted enough time already without it"
Get rid of Joe Rogan. False claims and information is killing people
One fix I would like to see. For the most part I like this app one complaint I have is when my phone updates the app doesnt keep track of the podcasts that Ive listened to so when I go back to listen were I left off it not easy and almost impossible for longer running podcasts
Music to send you. Love to hear music from my personal favorite list
. i love this app except for the fact that for some reason my downloads stop working without wifi or cellular data after a while? im not sure why this happens but other than that this is the most amazing music app i have ever used
"Great app, if you have premium. I got this app for the free music, and at first it was amazing. After about a month of listening there had come to be an ad after every song, and I had to get premium, to stop the ads, which is irritating, but worth it. It worked driving through the mountains with no service with the premium, and I have loved it since.Ive recently had an issue however, with songs not wanting to play. Ive tried both on and off wifi, data, and just the downloaded content but almost my entire library wont play for more than 15 seconds. Ive also tried deleting other apps and photos from the phone (thinking it was a space issue) but have continued to have this problem. Its only been an issue since the most recent update and its getting very frustrating because Id just like to listen and it isnt working. Ive also tried closing out the app, restarting the phone, and a couple other things with no luck"
I love the song track star. Best music app of all time
Great music. A fast app that lets you listen to great music. You can download some music to if you are not on data or WiFi. So I think that you should get it too
"Audio only podcast option needed. I LISTEN to podcasts so why do I need to download terabytes of data to LISTEN to JRE. It takes eons to download pointless data and makes my entire experience less than palatable. The app is very user unfriendly as even when I have managed to download an episode and listen it makes it difficult to seamlessly go to next ep. If travelling whilst listening and using navigation on phone I have to restart after every instruction, which is incredibly annoying. Do not tell me that paying for premium will fix these issues"
"Latest update stinks. Why do we have to be on WiFi, or data, to access so-called downloaded podcasts.   It worked fine before.  This needs to be fixed in a patch"
"Awful app. It worked great for the first few weeks, but after that, it became the worst music app Ive seen. First off, you cant rewind or repeat songs, so you can only listen to the song once until it comes up on the playlist again. Second, instead of playing the actual song, it gives you a playlist with the song in it. If i wanted a playlist, i would play a playlist. Third, it adds songs to your custom playlist. If i didnt put it on the playlist, it means i dont want it on the playlist. Fourth, it stops playing a song in the middle of it, and when you try to keep playing it, it restarts the whole song. And finally, it has this stupid glitch where theres no play button for the songs. I tried everything to fix it. I restarted the app, restared my phone, turning the wifi off and on again, using cellular data, but nothing worked. It wasnt something with the internet, because my other apps worked fine. After three days of waiting for the glitch to get fixed, I finally deleted it from my phone. I recommend using any other music app"
Folders. Cant figure out how to move songs into personal folders
"Doesnt stay connected to chrome cast. Other than the fact it eats up data, the dam app cant stay connected to a chrome cast for more than ten minutes without bugging out, causing you to lose the ability to change volume or songs without disconnecting and reconnecting"
"Doesnt work. App doesnt work with mobile data tried deleting and reinstalling still no progress , useless"
"5 Stars Best Music App. Great App. I loved how you can download playlists to use and listen to without using mobile data. Personally I dont think that there were possibly any problems with this app. I love the variety of music you can listen to, almost all of my favourite artists and songs were included, I adore it. Definitely 5 stars. Worth the amount of money it costs. Would recommend"
"Shuffling and queues. This app is amazing, but theres one thing that continues to bother me:Say I want to listen to a playlist on shuffle, but I want to listen to another song first. Id have to play the song, then once its over go to the playlist and shuffle it. Itd be a lot easier if there was a button or something that was just like add to queue on shuffle for the playlists.Other than that, though, this app is incredible.Another thing: its impossible to download a single song. Could that be changed?"
It is good but. It wont work on my phone it wont let me shuffle play on a track i search I deleted and reinstalled but same problem it makes me want to change to Apple Music unfortunately but it is a good app for the fellow cheapskate
My account got hacked. I didnt even get help for it i feel shady even going to the help center how is it that my account gets hacked but i dont even share my info with anybody
Best listening app. When I turn off my phone or go to a different app it still plays the music the app it is incredible best app by far
Very Nice. Can listen to hundred of songs no matter what kind. I recommend getting premium if you can afford it but otherwise normal version does have more ads and will add songs that you didnt add. But totally worth it. And plus you have podcast ranging from happiness to murder. And with premium you can listen to songs without WiFi or data. I recommend this app to anybody since you can get it on any device
"Horrible bug. So I have premium and I have songs downloaded in the playlist I use. Now it didnt matter how little service I had, I could open the playlist and go. Now it requires I have WiFi or service or else the playlist wont load. Just shows some 3 rolling dots and then a you need WiFi or cellular data to open this EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PREMIUM AND HAVE THE PLAYLIST DOWNLOADED SO I CAN USE IT OFFLINE. Please fix what the hell is the point of premium if I cant use it without WiFi"
STOP PLAYING SUGGESTED TRACKS. I just want to listen to the playlist I choose. I dont want to listen to any of your suggested tracks
"Opinion Wise. I like this app a lot for playing music. Even in offline mode from downloading songs thru Wi-Fi, it feels good. The only catch is it takes up a lot of data, so watch out. The payment rate for student discount &amp; regular standard rate is good"
One massive flaw. Price isnt horrible for premium but theres one huge problem. Offline mode should be adjusted to Wi-Fi only. I want to be able to download my music and not have to remember to go offline Before I leave my home. Its a hassle and keeps costing me in fees for additional data
Comical Error. Love your service but Tessie by the dropkick murphys isnt on their This Is the Dropkick Murphys which is hilarious. Ive also noticed issues with the This is playlists in the past but at this point it might as well be a random song playlist because evidently you arent able to accurately identify popular songs by individual artists even using your own data. Sad Other than this though incredible app just keeping you nerds honest
1 star. I used to love this app but its useless to me now. Songs randomly stop playing mid track which is very frustrating especially considering I pay a monthly subscription.  I moving on to other music platforms
"The Personal connection is Amazing. The personal connection, the way this stuff is explained helped me explore my own vibes. The question I asked my self immediately is if I am vibrating towards what I want to be Looking forward to more Sathya"
"Incredible App, Would Recommend. Yes, the ads can get a little annoying sometimes but its completely worth it for tons of free listening. Its super organized and there are so many songs to listen to"
Songs. Very good but they add songs that I dont like and you cant play songs with data or WiFi
Sucks. Sucks Says offline all the time when not connected to wifi. I have unlimited data. Tried everything including reinstalling the app but still does it Will be canceling it
Pretty good experience. They changed it so you can only have six skips for every hour unless you pay for premium and you cant re-wind a song or a fast forward but other than some of the other downsides its pretty good you can listen to music and you can still use a free but its better with premium but Im not too sure about premium because I already have to pay for data and all my other subscriptions such as Netflix Disney+ and Hulu so I dont want to pay more but other than that its pretty good would recommend
Cracking app. Ive used the free app for well over a year now and have to say really impressed with range of tunes available. I did go premium for a few months and preferred the quality and lack of ads but as with all music services feel that £10 a month is just too much when I already have a music library with 25k tracks. If the cost was £5 a month it would be a no brainier
Doesnt save half of my downloaded music. 3/5 stars because randomly my downloaded music will not show as downloaded forcing me to use data if I want to listen to half of my playlist. I pay 10 bucks a month to have my playlists downloaded just to get to work and see they arent downloaded. Janky
"I love this app. But I hate this new ui please change it back. It used to be really smooth but is all claustrophobic now. I dont like seeing the album art in the track list of playlists, or how squished together everything is. And please bring back the ability to see when a playlist was last modified"
Good. This app is good but not great because it is free but you also need WiFi or mobile data to play the songs. So it is not ideal if you are a person who is out all of the time but have a little bit of mobile data But apart from that the app is great
"Adds, skips and playlist. I gave you a rating of 4 out of 5 but this is because, adds appear when I skip a song and its annoying. And the fact that sometimes when Im playing my playlist, it switches to a different song that isnt in my playlist. When listening to my songs at school it randomly stops and doesnt continue playing although I have mobile data"
Songs cant be viewed. You cant view individual tracks
". i love it but the things i dislike are how it only lets you shuffle them and it adds songs on to a playlist and theres no way to remove them, also the suggestion tracks i don&#39;t like them and how they pop up randomly its annoying. but the part i dislike the MOST is 6 skips per HOUR really and i uses them all up because of the suggestion track i know you can get more with the premium  but i dont want to have to pay just to skip to a song that is all i have to say i hope they fix these things"
Unlike pandora. Unlike pandora it doesnt side track after the FIRST piece of music you pick I mean come on
"Untrusted. Keep getting my account hacked from around the world. Changed passwords (lots), stopped log in locations, 3rd party apps etc. Still rubbish, hacker back on in minutes. Check forums this is not a User error. Deleted App, changed password again and have now lost access. I have zero trust in your security"
Nice music. I love the music but I cant find how to use no data podcast
"Improved, but there are still some problems. I personally love the app, and this update makes it easier to search records from library and find fresh songs. Whats more, this update puts podcasts into a more prominent position (though I&#39;m not keen on it). There are several changes which are not perfect in this update. The default language of the app is based on phone setting. As a Chinese premium user, although the language of phone setting is Chinese, English is my common language in the app. In this update, I couldnt find the way to change language settings. The second is personal music library, which can be switched by clicking the playlist, artist or album.It is simpler to swipe left or right on the previous versions"
The best. You dont need to open youtube and waist data when you can make a playlist and listen to musicSo usefull
offline mode. offline mode will be more cool if to know when the cell is in wi-fi or mobile data mode
Its very good. But I think that you should be able to skip more than 6 songs I think it is without paying and erm you should be able to use without data or WiFi without paying
Amazing. This app is so good it provides all the music I want and I can also play it while my phone is off or when Im doing other things on my phone. I find it great that when you download a playlist that it can play off line as I dont have much data. I totally recommend this app for listening and creating music
I enjoy the app...but. I use this app all the time but a problem I have is when it adds random songs in my like playlist. I understand that if is playlist does not have enough songs they add recommended songs but my liked playlist has 40 tracks
"When it works its great. I have to restart the entire app every time a song ends, not sure why that is. Instead of automatically playing the next track, the app will not play any songs that follow. The only way to play more music is to fully close the app and restart. (Sick of doing this process every time Im listening to music)"
"New update messed up CarPlay. I Have had the app for years and loved it. But latest update messed up CarPlay functionality. My steering wheel and CarPlay screen controls used to work great when scrubbing thru a track. A quick press changes the track. A longer hold Advances and reverses in 10 second increments, but with the new update its now all choppy and inconsistent. Sometimes jumping 10 and 30 Seconds or even back to the beginning of the track with no logical or predictable pattern. This has to be a bug Theres no way Spotify developers would intentionally botch a feature like this. Hope a fix comes soon Just got the 11 pro max and was hoping this was maybe just due to my glitchy old IPhone X having problems, but the CarPlay functionalities are still choppy and inconsistent with the new phone . Next, Im going to try it out on my friends car to see if its just my car (2018 Hyundai Kona). Will post here what I find out. Spotify if youd like more info on the issues Im experiencing feel free to reach out"
"doesnt work. when i listen to specifically new music without data (using LTE) the songs take long to start &amp; the music stops without pausing for a couple seconds, then continues to do that also every couple seconds"
Cant disable video. There is no option to disable video while watching podcasts without downloading them. Uses up all my data when I dont have wifi. I have stopped listening to podcasts with video now
Amazing . I LOVE that u can see like parts of the music video but also be able to just tap on it to get the cover I like the data and battery  saving modes and the HUGE selection of songs. One prob: sometimes theres these things like it wont let you play a song I mean its not a big deal but hey The premium is better and there is actually NO ADS Thx for this amazing app ;)
"does not play without internet, just useless. once you stoped paying monthly you get nothing in return cannot even listen to one song. if my downloaded tracks played offline that would be great but this app is scumming all"
STOP PLAYING SUGGESTED TRACK. I PLAY A PLAYLIST I WANT AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT IT GOES TO SOME SUGGESTED TRACK THING AND PLAYS RANDOM SONGS I DIDNT ADD STOP
"Downloads are pointless. Have a limited supply of high speed data? Download podcast over wifi so you save on data? Doesnt matter here, the App still has to connect to the web in order to play your downloads. This isnt a problem on Apple Podcasts, or even Audible, but still Im here, and Ill keep dealing with the terrible layout and pointless download process because Joe Rogan is exclusive to your platform"
"my playlist wont download on my apple watch. I have spotify premium on my account and everything is working fine on my phone. However, when i tried to download my playlist onto my apple watch now spotify wont work at all on my watch. i go onto the app and why i try to access my playlist it just says loading. im not sure if this is to do with the new update or not but please fix it ASAP"
"Ignored bug. Cant login on app or website using mobile data, there is no support whatsoever. Other people with the same issue havent been helped either. If I am forced to use wifi whats the point"
"Worst 4 Podcasts. Downloading a JRE took seconds on Apple Music, literally takes hours on Spotify. Garbage for those of us who dont want to stream over data. Give us back Joe Rogan"
Good app 10/10. 10//10No fuss no messing strat to your  tracks
Noticed. Saw your company on Shiite that means you are on good track
"Its amazing but. The music is really great, I love how you can access any song you want forever. But, I dislike the new version for playlist.You couldve scrolled down on the playlist and choose a song you want but now you cant even choose a song, you have to wait to get to the song you want. But overall the app is amazing and its incredible"
"Drains battery even when the background data is shut off. Its killing my battery, I have the cellular and background data shut off. Yet somehow its still using a lot of data in the background and draining my battery. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled it, Im hoping it will fix that major issue. I pay for downloads it shouldnt be using my data when its shut off"
Banging tracks. Ive been using this app for years. I only use the free app as I feel £9.99 is a bit much
Amazing. Best music app I have used. Love that the lyrics are available for display on most at the bottom Only thing thats missing that I would like to see is if the current song playing is already in your personal playlist
"Amazing but needs more. Its an amazing app, I use it on a daily basis and just have the premium feature which is great. I have multiple playlists and I can listen to wherever because you can download it to the app to listen without data or internet Only complaint is its missing some music but theyre constantly adding new music so I cant complain at the same either. Just know some things may not be found yet"
Has become useless. App skips to tracks not in my playlists after 15 or 45 seconds
The best things in life are free. Never again will we have that sinking feeling that happens when you have the urge to belt out some of your favourite songs along side your most loved artists only to open that CD case and its either empty or holds something horrific like Christmas Carols by St Barthemans amateur choir.Ive only had the app 2 days and I feel like Im in my own private nightclub and the DJ has looked inside my head and knows every track Ive ever gone wild to
Playlist Copying. I think a nice addition to the software would be to allow for the transfer of titles from one outside playlist to your personal playlist. I was a fan of a playlist but also wanted to be able to add some more similar sounds. Opted to create a playlist with the same songs and just add them in. Stress to say the least
"The times. Always enjoyed music. 8 tracks, LPs, cassettes, CDs and MP3s. The selection is incredible. The price point is very good.At 63, I believe I enjoy Spotify more than most. Thanks OG"
Its not that great. It never really works when I get on it. I can activate my cellular data or WiFi and I cant get on it. Also when I go to play a certain song I have to go though so many others just to hear the one I picked thats why Im giving it a one star
"5 stars. I overall really enjoy this app, I dont have premium but I still love the app. I definitely will be getting premium soon just so I dont have to turn on my data"
"30 minutes ad free doesnt work. App is easy to navigate. Beyond that I see few pros. The 30 minutes ad free doesnt work. I have found no solution to this issue. I went through all the settings made sure the app was updated as well as my phone. Nothing fixed it. Warning if you want to listen to a specific artist only but dont have premium, you may be out of luck. I have to wade through 6-12 suggested tracks from other artists before hear a single song from the artist I want to listen to"
bug. 1. offload app2. turn off cellular data for it3. restore app4. re-enable cellular dataresult: app remains offline
"Horoscopes?. No thank you. I do not need someone or something random telling me lies about my personal identity. Nor do I need any negative self fulfilling prophecies or deceptive affirmations leading me astray. It is unfair and unrealistic to label ten million people around me as the same just because of theyre birth month and have that dictate who I chose to have relationships with and how I choose to see them. Sorry, horoscopes are just deceptive and evil with bad spiritual mojo behind. One star rating because horoscopes are terrible and zero is not an option. But 2 because Spotify has always been pretty good to me though.   I just dont play that game with pretty-but-dark identity influencing forces"
"Decent app, crap company. Decent app, not so great company. Cut the exploitation, propaganda and data mining"
Great music of my personal choice. Love Spotty Could do without adverts though
"Lost All Saved Data. I have no idea what happened but on Tuesday the 8th all of my saved data was lost. I wasnt able to access the app for an hour or two. However, good thing the still changed my credit card even though I cant get anyone to assist me"
"Suggested Track . Stop playing your dumb suggested track in the middle of playlists, the songs have nothing to do with the playlist, and are all so random, and I cant get rid of them I turn off autoplay, and it does it anyway This is super annoying"
"Wont play my downloaded tracks. Now sometimes if I have a downloaded track or album, itll play for a few seconds then stop. Now I totally understand if I didnt have any space in my phone but thats not the issue. How am I paying 10 dollars and some change each month and It wont even properly play my downloaded tracks. But play the Undownloaded ones perfectly fine..?"
Great Personal Music. I love having so many different choices of music.  You can always add the latest or old songs from growing up
Its great but some problems. Its my personal favorite app for music but I cant turn off shuffle on my playlist
Dog sht. Was good - changed the system 1 lost all my songs now telling me after two albums need to buy more data... DOGS FK U
Omg they added synced LYRICS. An incredible app. Must have
Songs play for a few seconds then stop. I have all my songs downloaded but this keeps happening even after redownloading them all even on data or wifi or neither this need to be fixed it's so irritating
BEST MUSIC APP EVER. The ads can be tricky but even if you dont pay to get rid of them its still incredible And they have spot on suggestions about what songs you might want to add to a playlistAnd you dont have to pay to get any songs all are free unlike some music apps like amazon music the only bad thing about this app is running out of skips  I would 1000% recommend to anyone of any age group 
"Worth it. Even if you cant be bothered paying £10 a month, you can live with the adverts but it does tend to eat your data if you cant use WiFi"
"APOLOGIES. Someone had hacked into my account, and that was the reason for all of the problems. The has apparently been resolved.Thank you for all of your help"
"I cant download music. For some reason I cant seem to download music  theres no download button. Ive watched my friends download music so they can listen offline, but theres just no download button on my screen. I do not have a Data plan so I cant listen to music at school unless someone sets up a HotSpot. Its frustrating, but other than that its an amazing app and I would definitely recommend it"
"They say 6 skips an hour. Its a lie. At most ive gotten 4. Usually 2-3 songs before 2-3 commercials so your dont really get into the music, as it is always hard cut to commercials. Ive had random songs inserted to my personal play lists, that fir me to go to website or use a skip to remove... and thus i ten bucks a month?"
Embarrassingly Glitchy. This app is the reason I will be not listening to Rogan anymore. How can an app simply not allow the user to hit play without losing track or skipping to random podcasts?
"Feels a couple years behind. First off let me say that I have this app specifically for podcasts. One in particular is Joe Rogans. I have had nothing but issues with the app connected to cellular data. The app consistently pauses for no apparent reason and I mean KEEPS PAUSING  Only on cellular though. Wifi, no issues. Id give this app a 5 star But seeing how Im a delivery driver in a suburban, well covered by cellular towers. I have no reason to pay for a worthless piece of data cluster F$@&amp; subscription.Hopefully yall figure this out"
"Barely mediocre app. One of the worst functioning apps. Cant resume playback on Bluetooth headsets, stops playing music for no reason, and why does it continue to try to use cellular data with downloaded songs or even dumber in offline mode Just because youre popular doesnt mean you get lazy and write horrible code"
Worked great at first. Used to listen to many tracks without interruption. Now the station stops after 1 song. I have to select the station every time and go through the ads. Disappointed
I love it. But. Can we PLEASE get live lyrics. Like. Why. I dont even get the half live lyrics mixed with background info anymore. And I have premium. Only reason I havent moved to Apple Music is the session ability which is INCREDIBLE Love the app but PLEASE give us lyrics
"Bugs. I have premium. For the past monthish, my app has been acting up with multiple issues:- I press play and the song either a) play for ten seconds, causing me to close the app and reopen it or b) the song doesnt play at all no matter how many times I close/open the app- the songs that I have downloaded arent working. Like, nothing is playing offline- Ive had to use my data to play any music, even on wifi Im not sure how else to get the attention of the developers/ app team so heres to hoping they fix it. I have premium and Im paying for it to not work :("
"Needs improvement. During the trial period the apps was working perfect on both wi-fi and mobile data, I was really enjoying it. As soon as the free period finished the apps crashes all the time. Sometimes It stops 3-4 times in one song. Its really annoying, it looks like developers force you to pay money"
"Needs better Shuffle. I love this app and I use it all the time, but it need to improve its shuffle button so that the tracks are actually shuffled. Another big thing that would make this app so much better if it you could edit the cover image of your playlist to an uploaded photo, not just the arrangement of the first four tracks in the playlists, as well as the caption on the MOBILE APP and Chromebook devices"
hey can you get rid of suggested tracks please. sometimes i just want a playlist with clones of one song or a playlist of like 5 songs but noOooOo i cant have nice things apparentlyif you dont want to remove it at least make it toggleable
No audio only option for podcast. Phone drains battery and spends data for nothing
Thoughts. Not keen on the way it selects tracks at random without being asked also some information history etc of the music would be really good
"Pocket Rocket. My iPhone become a hearth or hearing pleasure. A place of relax without warring about next track. Its like a feeling of comfort from self provider of music. Though its not my play list, but its on my phone and I can reach for it. I can reach for a source of pleasure during a date. I dont worry in my car for what to listen. I have yet to try voice search and play list switching.I am full filled. I imagine how premium will surprise me. I wonder on what others offer"
Connecting and Stopping. It takes literally FOREVER to connect. Doesnt matter if youre connected wi-fi or if youre on your data. It also stops and shuts off in the middle of your music
"Great Music App. I love this app so much. The one thing is I dont have data, so instead of podcasts maybe add songs I could play offline. Besides that its a awesome app if you wanna listen to music. It has a lot of different kids too, which I enjoy"
Good but could be better. I wish there were any easy way to access listening history. Currently the only way I know how is to log into the desktop app on my laptop. And even then it is only the past 50 songs
"Crashing. I used to love Spotify, and I even purchased Spotify Premium. I often listen to Spotify on my phone and also on my laptop using headphones.However, earlier it just suddenly stopped working. The app crashes whenever I open it. I tried closing the app and reopening it, I restarted my phone multiple times and I even deleted the app and re-downloaded it (deleting the 300+ songs I had downloaded, and I have no wifi to re-download them). None of this worked.Info: I have an IPhone XS"
"Constantly crashes. The latest update constantly crashes whenever I try to open it. There are claims its because of a Facebook integration, but I dont have Facebook because FB is creepy, so why is it sending my data to them. That behavior may be ok for free users, but Ive been a paying premium member for years"
The best app. This is the best app I have Eva used. I want to listen to a song I look it up on here and Icahn listen straight away love it . My phone company I use has a deal so I get it with my mob contract. Vodafone. Excellent app have told all my friends and family to use it. The best bit about it is if u get the one with out the adverts you get to download the music and listen to it on the go with out use ur mob data love it PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT NOW
What the heck happened. So I can be listening to a song and another song just starts playing I think its very annoying because I tap on the song and it plays a different song I walked out I have to wear them up and then I got it back on track and I can listen to any sound when will I dont changes again and again it always happens can you please fix this
Fix the crashing when phone is off and listen to music. I stoped using Spotify and switched to pandora because when Im in my truck I want to listen to music but it can go 2 songs sometimes shorter without it crashing and me having to do on to my phone and relaunch just to play the track again just for the song to restart its dumb if they fix it I may come back to it but this has been a problem for over 5 to 7 months so Im done with it
"Terribly awesome. My fave music app, but Im really disappointed that it doesnt support Apple Watch  I had to subscribe to Apple Music to just be able to listen to music while working out with my Apple Watch without having to have my phone on me. I really hope they provide Apple Watch support ASAP because its really frustrating that I have top subscribe to two music services simultaneously"
What has happened to this app. The last 2 weeks when I play music it cut out randomly on both WiFi and without WiFi and I have strong internet connection and data connection. I even just updated it hoping it would fix these bugs that keeps automatically closing the app randomly and it hasnt worked. Please can you fix this??
Survey participation. I find you quite ageist - I was disqualified from answering your survey due to my age. I found it weird. Why not collect my data and parse it out from your analysis rather than offend me?
Duo lists need work. Great for one person.  Did a family subscription with the intent of playing duo mix for my wife and I.  Listening to music in duo lists affects my personal account.  Now duo mix is mostly country which I do not prefer
AMAZING. The app is incredible never have any issues and can get any music i want. its amazing however itd be good for small accounts to be able to see if someone is listening to their playlist
"Glitches when playing downloaded content without wifi backup. At times my downloaded songs will not play when Im out of service, or have my data turned off.  Entire playlists, or just single random songs will not work, although each song has the green check mark clearly beside it.  Its very annoying An upside to the app is you can find every song or album you can think of, and the podcast selection is fantastic.  If the glitches Im experiencing would be fixed, my rating would be much higher"
Discover Weekly update. I love the app and have used it for almost 10 years But the new update took away being able to say you dislike a song on the discover weekly. i liked that feature and it helped me keep track of what songs i had already listened to. wish it would come back :(
"Love it. Innovative, personal, and easy-to-use music platform"
"If Im forced to use the app, it shouldnt be crap. Ive been forced to download this janky app so I can listen to a couple of my favorite podcasts, since I can only get them using the app now. This piece of crap stops my pods in the middle, then starts in on ones from years ago without warning. If youre going to profit off my data, at least be civilized enough to make the app as good as the free podcast apps I was using before. Unimpressed. Do not recommend"
Podcasts freeze. podcasts freeze constantly also privacy breaches
Amazingly Awesome . I love this app so much. I love how you can make personal playlists But I just wish you could see the video for the song as its playing. Thanks for making this app 
"Perfect music app especially for playlists. Ive had Apple Music and I personally think the way the playlists work on here is much better, more worth the money. Its way more personal on here and there are more settings to tweak around"
Give us easy access to All Songs. Why the hell cant you select All Songs to see all the tracks of an artist regardless of album? Been asking for this for years. Do it already Make it simple. Add the bloody feature that Apple and Prime  music make standardThis is easy. And logical
Awesome. This is so amazing it has literally every song Since I dont have cellular data I could download song too
Excelente. Excelente aplicación pa capacitarnos en el desarrollo personal
"Love it, but. Love so much about this service  But...as a music aficionado I wish there were more background info available about the musicians on the track"
One of the best music service. Please do not sell yr company to Facebook and other blood suckers.Make available in Africa and east Africa countries. We will pay
Let music be the food of life. Great variety and clever with accommodating various tastes to create personal library
"Love it but. If you do get something out us watching adds, since some of us are not and never will be premium members, not going to happen ever. At least be an honest merchant and give the 30 mins add free you guys promise after us watching very long data- eating-commercials. We do our part, please do yours. Is no fun having to watch this nice adds every 1 or 2 songs  As for the rest, yeah is great "
. I always will and always have loved this app. Not only is it easy to use but it also has a wide variety of music. It feels personal and there are so many small things about it that really make it so useful. Definitely worth the money for premium 
"Great app but for some reasons the last few days it stopped working. I used to listen to music while on wifi or data now if Im on wifi and data is off its not working, its asking me to go online. Other apps work fine, like Facebook, YouTube, Netflix. It needs to be fixed. It works sometimes, but sometimes its not. Just kindly asking the app crew to fix this.Thank youLoved it prior to this few days"
Crappy without connection. Fix the bugs consisting of thinking ur connected to data and loading songs u already have saved
Stop suggested songs. Its so annoying just make it easier to turn off suggested tracks. I literally turned off auto play and still plays auto play Plz fix this
"Tired. I used to love this app so much, but lately Ive been getting bombarded by ads after listening to just ONE song. Literally, one track plays and then its like 7 ads one after another. I find it very irritating and annoying that I cant enjoy my music for at least 10min without having to hear so many advertisements"
Not working with cellular data. I try to use but never works Im try to open the app and then I get kicked out of the app
New update. The new update has made this app SO much more glitchy and unreliable... not to mention it can be very slow.If you want to download podcasts before your day so you can listen to them offline without using data- think again. The new update has made it all so dodgey. Poor management
"App keeps stopping. Starting about a month ago, my app keeps pausing my music at random times and I have to wait over an hour for it to stop, closing the app and restarting my phone both dont help. Also calm down with the suggested tracks. Its SO annoying when I go from my absolute favorite song to a song that Ive never heard of that I instantly hate. Seriously"
Enjoying this app . Glad I get to listen to Joe Rogan he offers a lot of information thanks to his guests and him
Doesnt work. It constantly goes out of sync when I listed to podcasts: I skip 15 seconds back on my Lock Screen or my Apple Watch and the app goes back to half an hour before or whatever position was when I unlocked the phone I guess. Basically unusable as I constantly lose track of where I was and have to list again very long portions of podcasts
"The Best. Best music app there is.  I would die without music in my life.  The app has the ability to make your own playlists and save them to you profile.  There is even a built in eq and you can adjust the sound quality to save data or force optimal sound.  Also, 10 bucks a month for premium isnt bad.  I spent way more than that on cds before"
"Keeps crashing Coercive psychological ads. Ive tried switching networks, Ive tried just using cell phone data and Ive tried deleting and reinstalling the app and no matter what the app keeps on crashing mid song. Also tons of ads pushing an agenda"
problem with offline listening. I was trying to listen to music in my car but for some reason most of the music I have downloaded won&#39;t play?? I can click on a song but it won&#39;t start. the problem has been happening for a few days and I&#39;d hate to use my data just so I can listen to songs that should be playing :/
Awful experience. Trying to vibe and listen to music and the app keeps freezing and skipping my songs I have 4 bars of 5g data so this should not be happening
Tracks. Well laid out app. Easy to use
The worlds music at your fingertips. This is a brilliant resource.Being able to download single tracks instead of whole albums would be so much more convenient though
"Bugs. App literally doesnt work, songs constantly pausing and not starting, and no it snot to do with data/ wifi or storage"
"Keeps crashing. Recently keeps crashing all the time When Im playing a playlist every 30 seconds it crashes and when Im listening to my podcasts at home the same thing happens. Ive tried everything I could find online: hard reset of my phone, updating my phone, deleting all the data and cache, then restarting my phone, then redownloading Spotify. Its extremely annoying to deal with"
"One fix I would like to see. For the most part I like this app one complaint I have is when my phone updates the app doesnt keep track of the podcasts that Ive listened to, so when I go back and try to listen were I left off,  its not easy and almost impossible for longer running podcasts. Additionally you still have to listen to adds in the podcasts but you can fast forward them at least"
Good app but. The idea of the app was incredible but the 1 thing that I dont really enjoy about it is the fact that you can only do individual songs on the album that you create from several singers but I think it would be better if you could add albums from singers as well as just individual because for example I would like to listen to every song from one singer but only one song from another singer so please TAKE MY ADVICE TO MAKE YOUR APP BETTER THAN WHAT IT ALREADY IS so more people will get it for your incredible thought
"Matt L. Great app Been using for years, and it is one of the few apps that actually updates music quickly, Has millions of known and unknown songs. Not to mention it has correct track names and you can down load your created playlists and play them off line I love it"
"Malfunctioning. Not working the way it should. I can not access my downloaded tracks while offline. And now today I cant push play but it shows something is playing but no sound is happening. If Im going to pay for this, it needs to work"
THE BEST APP EVERRRRRRRR. This is the best music app I have ever downloaded u can plays songs without being on the app and I can have ur phone turned off and it still plays there are so many songs I recommend that if ur looking for a music get this one
"Great place for music and podcasts. Can find just about any song or podcast. I love the offline, data saving feature; it has saved me a ton of data I 100% recommend going Premium"
"THEE BEST MUSIC APP. Look no further, this is your one stop music shop. Save music , make playlist , listen to personal suggested playlist , share your music with you friends, the list is endless. Me taking the time to actually write a review should be all you need to know. Happy listening  Give it a try"
Best app ever. My son signed me and I love It. Best ever easy to create personal playlists and I am 70
"Good but could be better. Im rating this app three stars because overall its quite a good app - you can listen to lots of songs, download podcasts for free, and they have almost every song, but sometimes the adverts can be really annoying and long for the free version, and also I really dont like the fact that it doesnt always work on mobile data. Like its almost a luck of the draw - will it work or will it not? I find that quite irritating as I like listening to music when Im out and about. I also dont like that the 6 skips an hour doesnt always work. Like an hour after Ive used the last skip it still wont skip tracks. I mean its still a good app, and its understandable that there are ads and stuff, but I just really hate the fact it doesnt work on by mobile data. Other than that, quite a good app with 6 skips an hour which is better than no skips. Would recommend getting if youre not willing to pay for anything"
"Unable to play music when in offline mode?. I cannot play my downloaded songs when offline or on airplane mode, so can only play music by using my data or when I have access to WiFi. If anyone knows how to fix this it would be much appreciated"
"Hands Down Best Music App. It didnt take me long to decide to upgrade to the Premium Membership. Everything about this app is easy to maneuver and learn. Of course with premium, I dont deal with ads or no more skips left. I love how this app learns your music preferences and created numerous playlists for you to try. As well as a Release Radar with the NEWEST of all genres you like. Also a Discover Weekly is another favorite playlist it creates with songs you may not have known existed in the genres you prefer to listen to. Create your own playlists easily and download them so when youre not able to use mobile data or WiFi, you can still play your favorite songs. If you use Google Maps, the two apps link together so you can still play your favorite tunes on the road without going back and forth between GPS &amp; music. I HIGHLY recommend this app. Theres tons of info I havent listed here so go check it out and see for yourself"
Your personal DJ. Asks questions about your listening preferences then does a pretty good job of figuring out what you want to hear. Different from an XM channel in this respect.  Quality of sound is good too
GREAT. So far I have SO MANY personal playlists and I downloaded almost all of them. I DEFINITELY recommend premium
"Great, but please improve the Apple Watch app. I really want to download songs on to my watch for running. Youve been talking about this for ages. Please fix"
Irritated. The way the podcasts r played is stupid u have to select audio only ok fine. But thanks to the fact that I didnt know I had to put it in offline mode to play downloaded podcast it chose to stream audio and video and wiped my half my data out in ten days that usually takes me a month to use
"Works well, but better on my tablet. A weird thing is happening on my tablet, where it lets me play songs without random mixes beforehand. Im not sure this is meant to happen... but I take advantage. Good enough. (Fine, consume half my data)"
"No WiFi no music. Dont get me wrong its a great app and it has all the Music I could ever I want, but I dont have data so I cant listen to music off WiFi. And I get it, I just wish I could listen to it off WiFi"
"Great, but not perfect. Its astonishing that you can download songs and podcasts for offline listening, but you cant access them without a data/internet connection first. Defeats the purpose.  Also, the auto delete function for podcasts hasnt worked for me (after completing episodes) and I have to manually delete them afterwards. Lastly, when connected to Google Home speaker systems, there is a considerable delay between songs. Noticed when playing albums that usually feel seamless when listening to on phone speakers or headphones"
"Track information (classical). Would appreciate being able to pull artist detail, year recorded and location"
"Offline needs work. App feels unorganized, you have to go into settings to turn offline mode on or off.  Video podcasts will eat up your data plan, and battery no easy way to download just audio or play just audio"
"Login with apple not working. Demanding an email address tells me youre mining data, why else would it not work?"
Low data mode. The low data mode doesnt really work. When it is on the canvas is still there and I dont hear a difference in quality
"Keeps shutting itself down. On my 30min journey to work it regularly closes 5-6 times and I have to reopen the app and press play again, and it plays the song from the start. Its not my data/signal, its been fine for months. Please fix this, its becoming unusable"
Please stop adding music. I listen to music almost everyday but I hate it when you guys add music when I already age like 20 songs or more. I was trying to listen to a certain playlist but you guys just added a suggested track but I dont want any extra songs
"LOVE. This is the best music app ever Has like any song you can think of Any thing from top pop to rap to even musicals And my personal favorite, karaoke U  need to get this app HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Great overall. Its fantastic like always but i have noticed that sometimes music wont play even when im on wifi or on my data
Bad interface yes I hate the interface. I want to be in control of the data I download. I find the interface difficult to use
"does not play without internet, just useless. if my downloaded tracks played offline that would be great but this app is scumming all"
Unhappy. Account got hacked and emailed changed after 2 weeks. Make it impossible to cancel trial. Cant do it online nor on my phone. Have to use messaging bot and then talk to someone only to say account has already been cancelled. Cant even send a conformation email
Incredible. This app is incredible The coolest part about this is you can make youre own playlists
Endlessly connecting with everything blanked out. My partner has been experiencing similar issues when attempting to connect to the app. Logging in via the browser works fine but in app there is an endless connecting banner and everything is blanked out. We are both on the latest version as well and 100% have data. My partner has a worse issue where he has tried logging out and back in and the links to login via email all say expired when clicking for the first time. The emails have now stopped sending all together. Pretty poor experience. Im a loyal Spotify user so its not nice to have this happening. Disappointing
"Great App. Over the years I enjoyed listening to music via radio and I still do, but listening to music via this app is cool.  From playing albums, 8 tracks, cassettes, and yes CDs to now streaming music.  Time has changed.  If you havent downloaded this app give it a try"
"Why wont my playlist play after one song. I love this app, I use it every day on my commute to work, but for some reason over last few days when I put my playlist on as Im out and about itll play one song then stop playing anymore after that until I close the app down, turn my mobile data on and then load it back up"
Awesome. This app is awesome it gives you all your favourite songs I use it a lot it has sound tracks from movies and everything
"Frequent stopping of music. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled, used data and WiFi interchangeably, and I still have issues with my music constantly stopping and pausing after 9-10 seconds. So frustrating"
"Tracking issues. Sometimes when I try to rewind 15 seconds using the Lock Screen buttons or when I unlock my phone with this app open while playing a podcast, it will jump back several minutes and I lose my place. Sometimes it happens back to back and it jumps to the same place so it seems like a cache issue"
Daily mix. Like the arbitrary selection but cant figure how to play personal playlist
Pausing randomly mid song. My music keeps pausing mid song randomly. Im a premium user. It pauses on WiFi and data
"The Best. This is a great application, choosing tracks, downloading, creating playlists etc., all so easy. Then you receive suggestions and lists made for you, Ab Fab"
"I love it but having some issues. I love the app and I have premium bc I love downloading the music and podcast to play offline while im at work but recently a lot of the songs and podcasts i download end up deleted so i cant listen to them offline?? I thought maybe it was a storage issue but its not. Sometimes ill get a bar at the too of the page saying an amount of songs are being downloaded but then it will go away quickly and come back repeatedly. Im not sure what the issue is. I have wifi, data, AND storage. Im beginning to think maybe its a bug"
Amazing app. I love being able to download songs and listen to them on the go without using data I did have one hiccup though. I had a playlist all ready to play while I did some work but after the first song it started playing songs off my playlist. It only happened once and it hasnt  done it since. Other than that amazing app
Great source for music but theres one problem. Stop playing suggested tracks when Im listening to an album that has no relevance to the suggested tracks
"Pretty bad for video podcasts. I drive a lot for work and download a few podcasts some have video including JRE. It starts playing just fine but if you lose service and it comes back the app keeps trying to play the video and it gets stuck, even tho Im playing right from downloads, timer runs like its playing but no sound. They removed offline mode so cant even bypass the video when you want to. Give us an option instead of eating all the data. Whats the point of downloading anything if I cant play it. Put the phone on airplane mode and it starts playing from way back so now I have to fund where I was. Annoying"
"Playlists non-functional. Mid playlist, app plays string of random Suggested Tracks completely unrelated to listening history"
The good and the bad. Love the music and personal playlists and suggested music. Dislike the constant ads to upgrade
"Awesome but. Amazing but I wish I could download songs to listen to when I have no WiFi or data, theres also this weird glitch where Im playing my playlist then I leave the app to play Minecraft or something then the music stops and I have to go back onto the app to start the music again and the song will start over too, thats just something that keeps happening, if you could fix that glitch I would give 5 stars, but great job "
The best. One of the best music app i have ever used. I like the theme and also the huge data base that it includes 
"One of the worst apps. Dont even bother with podcast because theyll just keep giving u ads the whole episode. Plus when I download app to save data, it wont let me listen to said downloaded episodes. So basically you just waste storage on your phone for nothing. Terrible for podcasts. I say go with any other app"
"Podcast Audio/Video option. Can we have a choice between downloading Audio only &amp; Downloading the full video Podcasts with video just use up too much data and we cant listen offline unless we download the episode(having video makes this really slow)Itd be nice to have the option especially if were paying monthly,"
Song issue. As much as I love this app Ive been having an issue where 10-12 seconds into my songs they stop dead in its track and I cant play the song again. Its been happening for over a couple weeks now and I have no clue what to do
"Please fix offline mode. Offline albums do not display the track list when the mobile signal weakens or is interrupted (e.g. in elevators or subway). I have to put my phone in airplane mode and reopen the album, or wait until I have a strong internet connection again :( Really annoying. App is great otherwise"
GET RID OF THE SUGGESTED TRACKS. Do it
Lagggy af. This app is amazing and I love it but outta nowhere its been extremely laggy and I tried reinstalling and it didnt work. Tried using data too. Idk what the issue is but as of now Im paying for premium that I cant even use
Doesnt Sync Between Devices. I have an iPhone for work and an Android for personal. I pair my Bluetooth ear buds to my work phone so I can listen to podcasts and take calls. But when I switch over to my personal phone the app hasnt synced where I was at in a podcast and I have to scrub through and find it myself. 
Great App Totally Recommend. I have never had any ads so far and I really enjoy the app. I like that there is Disney songs because those are my personal faves. I totally recommend this app to all people
Couldnt open the app. With all the focus of using the app on iOS and the worse thing to see is it couldnt open the app at all because of Facebook sdk??  I dont even use Facebook and is my data going to FB? even if I am not a Facebook user?
"Offline?. My settings say it is not offline, but I can only play tracks downloaded. Frustrating"
Good app. The app is great especially when it comes to playing it from another device and the interface is great but I wish they like a personal library we add music to like other apps instead of a liked song playlist
"Very good, needs work . This app has the best music selection. I love how it helps you discover new tracks similar to what you are listening, other apps do it, this one does it better. But I would love to see an interface update, I think thats really necessary and I dont know why but its hard for me to navigate in the app,( the home section) it looks old compared to other music streaming apps, and also the Apple Watch app could be much better, like Pandoras for example, I think the team can do a great job if they get to it"
"Great App . I just wanted to pop in and say, that this is a great app  The personal details are wonderful, and I ver much enjoy all the podcasts, keep it up, and Happy New Year <3"
Dont Spy On Me. Scroo the Paytriut Act. Thank you :)
"Terrible. I have to listen to JRE on Spotify now, and the podcasts never load even if I download them and constantly stop playing in the middle of a podcast. Barely works at all when using cell data even if I download. Only works with WiFi and sometimes it doesnt even load the podcasts with WiFi"
love it but. i wish i would stop giving me suggestions for songs when im listening to my playlist its like playing suggest track  i hate it
"Wait 20 minutes to play just 10 seconds. Since the latest update, music buffers for 20 minutes than places 10 seconds, freezes the remaining minutes by playing silence. Both via data and wifi"
Cannot get logged back in because of payment info. It was great until I forgot to update my payment information since I got a new car. Then it logged me out and it keeps saying error when I try to get the link sent to login without a password. It also keeps saying wrong password which is the right password. Now Im stuck at work without my music for six hours because of this crap. Im done
"Music constantly stopping/skipping. I have deleted and re downloaded the app, turned both car & phone on/off. Re registered Bluetooth device in car. Downloaded tracks direct to my phone and put my phone in aeroplane mode (with Bluetooth enabled) yet the music still stops and starts and skips constantly. At this point Id rather listen to talkback AM radio"
"Terrible. App is rubbish. Randomly closes itself for no reason, I have to go online just for it to show me my downloaded music, it regularly deletes the 3000-4000 songs i have downloaded, meaning I have to redownload all of it if I want to listen offline (i dont have the data to stay online all the time). App is a buggy mess and for the money they charge for premium? Its not worth it. Its awfull. Simple things theyre too lazy to fix. Plus they rip off the artists. Id suggest google play or literally any other app"
Its rlly good. You can create loads of playlists listen to podcasts and share them with other users if u want I love it personally I recommend it if you love free music and playlists also if u get premium you can listen to them out side without using data
"Offline playback doesnt work anymore. If I dont have service or have airplane mode on, Im having trouble listening to music downloaded on my phone. If I can see my downloaded albums, then it will only play one track at a time. Ill have to open my phone and start the next track each time. But often, it wont even show me my downloaded albums to play"
Constant failure. Two podcasts back to back deleted after less than ten minutes. 100% failure rate. Probably a scheme to protect me from Rogans fake news. Surely the app cant be accidentally this bad Another week of failures. Good luck using it without blowing your data out
"Joe rogan, not music related. I cant access any of the joe rogan experience podcast. Ive updated the app, restarted my phone. Its been months now, and it just isnt on the app. My friend sent me a link and it just sends my phone on a loop from the app store to the web link. Its a mess. Shouldve left it on Youtube"
Major bugs. App logs me out whenever I dont have data and am unable to log back in
Its lagging. The app is lagging its usually pretty good but doesnt store data well
I love it. The app is incredible it is so awesome I dont know what to say I love it so much I can listen to my songs  anywhere 
"Some problems. Overall the app and songs are well. But one significant problem is it stopping suddenly. I dont know if it only happens to me, but it just suddenly stops and its VERY VERY annoying. Whenever it stops I have to press continue, and the song restarts again I dont have premium either so I guess I just have to wait until the song is over. Which takes forever because out of 10 times, Id give it a 8 out of 10 for stopping so suddenly another problem is sometimes it wont play...Update: I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND THE APP ANYMORE ITS TOOO IRRITATING I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU HAVE SUPER GOOD DATA OR YOUR WIFI IS GOD"
WONT. STOP. CRASHING. Cant keep a track or podcast playing longer than a minute without the app crashing
Absolutely amazing. This app is incredible it has all song on it and you dont need to pay unless your premium. 5 out of 5 from me 
"Can barely play songs. I dont know what happened to this app, but its become almost unusable.  Ive been a paid subscriber for years, but now when I try to play songs Ive got a 50/50 chance itll actually work.  The playhead just stays still.  And maybe itll kick in if i fast forward, or skip ahead and skip back, or maybe it wont.  Maybe itll stop playing a song half way through and then refuse to play that particular track until i log out and log back in.  Or maybe itll magically start working randomly.  or maybe it wont play for a week.  but the next track will play.  until suddenly that track refuses to play, but now the previous track decides to work.Its a garbage app and Im about done with it.My phone isnt old.  My OS is up to date.  The app is up to date.  And this has been going on for many updates.  Even downloaded songs refuse to play half the time.FIX YOUR APP"
"Lately seems laggy. Idk why the app has seemed very laggy, slow, glitchy lately...even when I just play music as normal while offline (and SUPPOSEDLY having premium). Itll have problems with shuffling music or with offline music downloads (titles Ive already pre-downloaded for those offline moments I pay ahead of time to have ready) ...like Im constantly seeing things disappear/not allow playback. And, noticed the filtering artists function doesnt work %100, itll still shuffle random songs when I enter in an option to only listen to 1 specific artist. Needs work and it is constantly causing me data charges for things that should be ready in offline mode when I download them Ive been using you guys for years and I have a family plan so my family can enjoy the sound also...please touch your app up Im using a brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max and know its not my software"
No thank you. It takes up way to much data so yeah
"Okay. The same thing keeps happening. Why does it have to play a suggested track? Itll stop randomly, and Ill play it again and an ad comes up and then it stops. I really need you to fix this. Its really annoying. Every time this happens and it really gets to me, Im going to come back and but one star lower. This is really annoying"
AMAZING . I have to say this is the best app I have ever downloaded. It can keep on a playing the music when u turn ur phone of or go to a different app and it has all the songs in the WORLD So I give it a 101% 
". I like how the add songs to playlist is now, much better than before. Only suggestion I have is a personal preference thing, it would be dope if queued songs stayed in the lineup and didnt go away after theyd played? Sometimes I queue something and then I forget to pay attention to thy e song I wanted, and it would be much easier to skip back to it than look it up and add it again"
Um. I used to love this app and never really mines the random song choices since I refuse to pay for premium. The app itself keeps crashing on my phone. Ill get to listen to about two songs and it will keep crashing after that. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall it. Thats didnt work. Checked for updates. That wasnt it either. Nothings working
Its good. I like it. I love it actually They thing is..when I make a playlist it just add songs I made one playlist for one personal song. It just kept adding them after I removed the songs...How do u take that off? It ruined my mood really I got really mad fix it and if it is tell me how to fix it bc this just ruined my mood literally gosh
Trash. Every time I try to log in it kicks me out when I have WiFi or cellular data and when I turn it of it lets me but wont log me in cause there is no internet
good app BUT. Its a good app but the suggested tracks thing is very annoying
Worst App Ever. Apple s*cks and you get the worst stars for it. The most selfish and scared makers in the universe. Theres a special place in h*ll for all of you. STOP STEALING MY INFORMATION AND TIME AND MONEY IF YOURE GOING TO CONSTANTLY BE THE D*VIL
Biblioteca. Me gustaría que fuese más fácil incluir canciones de la biblioteca personal dentro de la app
"Amajin:D. Amazing app~ If you have premium you can download songs and listen off WiFi, and skip as many songs as you like along with reorganizing the songs in your playlist. If you not have premium you can listen to using but cant download and listen off Wi-Fi unless you have data or smthn and you can only skip a few songs without having to wait an hour to skip again other than that its really good :D my backup account doesnt have premium but its only like less that $15 for a family plan I think a month "
"Incredible. Get. Premium. Its the only app I have on my phone and its literally the best app ever, but really you need premium to really get the best out of the app, but seriously, its definitely 100 percent worth it"
"Would be 5 stars but its stopped working. For some reason the update means I cant use the app anymore and play tracks, the link is broken. Pretty irritating. Hope they fix the bug soon"
"Good app but. Ill start off by prefacing that I like the app, the playlists it creates, a lot of the layout, having podcasts, and most songs one wants. However among other flaws, one thing that really irks me is that I have downloaded albums and it takes a while for them to load if they do at all. This happens when Im online, but if I inconveniently turn off wifi or data, it loads. I have a good amount of albums downloaded and it just gets really annoying, since in theory, theyre downloaded, on my phone, and should load quickly. Overall, though, I like the app and what it does"
"Podcast Issues. The podcasts have consistent glitches that rarely allow them to play (playback unavailable) and there is also no option to play a podcast without the video, which results in way more data usage. Never had any of these issues when I used the apple podcast app"
"Consistent app breaking problem. This is the 7th time ive had to delete and reinstall this app because theres a glitch where sometimes the songs refuse to play or will play several seconds of it and then stop. This problem can only be solved by deleting and then reinstalling the app, ive tried every other type of fix and it hasnt worked. My phone is up to date and so is my app, its aggravating that I pay for this service and then I have to re-download the songs Ive previously downloaded which wastes time, and data"
"Great app, but keeps freezing. App used to be smooth. Now it keeps stopping songs randomly. And no, its not because of my data or wifi. It chooses which songs it wants to work on, and my downloaded songs that dont require data or internet sometimes wont play. I always find myself restarting the app. Please fix this. It literally never used to do this. I love this app but now i be thinking about switching to apple music"
Good app can be better. Love the app and is really useful. Has Playlists for almost every mood.But if we could also view lyrics right in the app and also if you could rearrange your personal playlist it wouldve helped a lot
Good music but suggested tracks are dumb. Every time I listen to music it plays suggested tracks that I don&#39;t even like them please remove it or let people skip even if they used all of there skips
Amazing. This app is incredible. Nearly every song I search for is there. Premium is well worth it. Strongly recommended to anyone willing to pay a little bit per month
Great but. I hate that it add music to your playlist and wont let you listen to another track once you use your six skips. Also I hate that when Im listening to music it randomly just stops playing and has me repeat the song over. Then I replay it to listen to it and it stops again. Very annoyinf PLEASE FIX
"Great app. The algorithm that recommends songs is incredible. I get to discover so many new, amazing artists"
Download. My tracks aint downloading
"YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. Ive had this app for ages and I can tell you its awesome no like legendary Its got GLEE SONGS ON IT ( yes Im a massive fan of glee). Its just such a reliable app If I had to say one downer about it is that you cant have it without internet but Ive got my mobile data so YAY . This is like the best app in the music industry so if you are reading this and your not the developer GET THIS APP, GET YOUR HEADPHONES AND LISTEN TO YOUR FAV SONGS"
"most used app in my phone. absolutely incredible app, i have been using premium for six years now. the only suggestion is that the app offers an option/setting that enables a real shuffle, which plays every single song once before repeating. but even without that, the app is easily worth $10 a month"
AMAZING. OMG SO GOOD this app is like the best any song u want to listen too is free is u have wifi or data def recommend
Love it. Easy to use and easy to organize personal playlists or add playlists to your library. Great selection of music
"Best app ever. I love this app,u can leave the app with the music still playing and for iPhone u dont have to pay for music and android u dont have to download music,saves u from hacks,bugs,and sexual assault"
"Plays 1 min then crashes. Starting a couple days ago (11/25/2020), a song will play for about 1 minute then the app crashes. When I open the app it is back at the beginning of the song. I did install the latest version of the app today. I even upgraded from iOS 13 to iOS 14 but that didnt help.I only play downloaded songs and even turn cell data off for Spotify so I dont accidentally stream songs using data. Offline Mode is not on nor do I want it on (they need a Only Stream Via Wifi option). The problem only happens when I am connected to wifi. If cell data is off and Offline Mode is on, it will work. But if cell data is on (even connected to wifi) the problem happens regardless of Offline Mode. When off wifi, it works fine"
"Weird bug. App works great. Has worked great for years. These days however, some songs don&#39;t play when shuffling a playlist. Often times it is the first song to play after hitting shuffle. It just sits at 0:00 and doesn&#39;t get going. This happens with songs that are seemingly &#34;downloaded&#34; for offline play. I know the app doesn&#39;t completely download songs in a playlist given that they have trouble playing if i have a poor internet connection. Nonetheless, I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of my songs just don&#39;t play and get stuck at 0:00. A skip to the next track usually does the trick, but if I go back to the track that didn&#39;t play, it doesn&#39;t play. This happens to tracks randomly and in no pattern. All the tracks are available on Spotify, not downloaded local files"
Great Platform. I would be interested in a more in depth filter attachment. Right now Im struggling with filtering out vocals and instrumental tracks. I like how google filters their data
"Awesome. I love the playlist specifically made for me, like new songs I havent heard, and daily mixes. And I love that you can follow and like songs and give support to artists. And I like the watch this advert for thirty minutes of ad free listening feature. Its cool. And there is such a huge range of music, its honestly amazing. I love getting recommendations from people and discovering new genres I like.All in all a great app, and since we are all in isolation I dont have to worry about using all my data out and about listening to music"
"GREAT APP. Pretty sure if you have used the app you know why I gave it 5 stars, but like this is an amazing app and youd an create your very own playlists of your favourite songs I listen to my personal playlist to go to sleep You can also check out other peoples playlists :)"
Feedback. I dont know why but it say it doesnt work on ur country but my friends are using it my phone is iPhone 7 by pass 
Its a really good music friend. Like pretty much everything about it Would only say an option not to swipe to change tracks as Ive skipped tracks unintentionally Maybe like the rewind and wrapped features in the options  please
"Perfection, except shuffle issue. Love love love Especially all the playlists including the weekly playlists based on what you listen to. And what a data saver that you can download a playlist so you dont have to use data. BUT when you press the shuffle play it just starts at a random place within the playlist and then plays songs in order. So I really wish they would fix that"
"Inconsistent as hell. Its queue functionality is the most frustrating part. I want to listen to songs by the same band, but searched by the song it autoplays random. If i&#39;m in the middle of a playlist and want to search for stuff to play after, i have to put it in my own new playlist because tge queue adding will interrupt the current playlist which you have to find again. Make adding songs and playlists to a personal library a feature like apple music or I cant justify paying for premium"
"Its great but. So my only issue here is I have a nice list of likes music. Stop playing suggested tracks in your likes music files. Literally wastes all of my skips every time it does it. Case and point, most of my likes list is hard rock/metal/etc. whyjust why are you forcing me to listen to hip hop and other crap like that. Just dont"
"Not bad. Ive had premium for 4 years and have never had a problem with the app, but this update isnt too great. There was no need in changing the layout for the library and I can no longer see what tracks artists are featured in"
Fails often. I find that sometimes the music wont play data or wifi and I have to go to my settings and turn on offline than flip it back for it to work
Logged me out. I updated the app and I used some today and then I try to access it again later and its making me log in and that wouldnt be a problem if I could remember my password info and plus I didnt even log out of the app
"good but new feature ?. I like the app, but my only issue is that you cant get rid of the podcasts, someone hacked my account and listened to a podcast that i dont want on my account and its now shown as a top podcast when it was listened to once. please have a feature that can get rid of that"
Pretty good. Its a really good app but lately theres been some weird glitches like itll randomly close the app out rn the song Im on it has closed out five times within the first two minutes of it. I checked with my siblings and they have that problem too. Other than that its awesome and works really well with data when on the road
"Best music app. Greatest music app I ever used, never had any issues with other songs search or quality.Consumes less data then rest of other apps.Fits my needs great"
"Huge playback issues. Out of nowhere, if I skip to the next song, the app will stop playing my music. I can exit the app, reload it, and music still will not resume playing. I have to exit the app a few times to get music playing again, but if I skip a track or try to play something from a new playlist, playback stops again. On an iPhone XR"
Artists list isnt disappearing anymore. Im on update version 8.620 and I think thats a big part plus I got data saver turned on hopefully this holds its been a pain with the list but worth it for the amount of music I get keep updating 
"Needs to be fixed. Would be 5 stars, and Im still on the fence with 4, leaning towards 3. Its a great app, great music selection but lately the app has been crashing, songs wont download correctly. Songs will randomly un-download and refuse to re-download. Premium costs over $10 a month, with all these complications thats not a fair price. I love this app but it needs to be fixed"
good but. i dont like how it plays suggested tracks that arent on my playlist like i wanna listen to my sad songs not deep throat by cupcakke. pls stop adding random songs into my playlists... ty :))
Suggestions. Stop adding tracks to my playlists
Five stars. Way more personal than Apple
"good but a few problems. The app is great and I love the fact that I can find music that I havent listened to before which is tailored to my taste. But I cant get premium for some reason on my app and its really annoying. Also, when I download a podcast episode is goes away after 2-4 days and wont show up unless Im not connected to WiFi or data and even then it wont allow me to play it. Hope someone can help ((:"
"Unimpressed long time user. I still find this app to be clunky and it crashes easily, takes lots of battery and data for suboptimal output.  I continue to use it but Im less than impressed as they continue to bill us more and more each month with minimal added value particularly within the platform"
"Not playing I downloaded music. Cant currently play any music that isnt downloaded even with offline off. Wont allow to search anything. Basically isnt connected to internet at all. Doesnt matter what WiFi connected to or if only using data, doesnt work"
"Great way to discover new music. With WiFi and a good mobile internet account it&#39;s a way to take your music with you everywhere. If youve not got a good data deal, you can still download all you want onto your smartphone and play off line, with a premium account. Then when youre travelling you can play it through your vehicles Bluetooth, so youre not dependent on the local radio stations availability. And then theres the amount of music available. Ive discovered artists Id never heard of who are amazing. Then you can check out their back catalogues, and other similar acts, and your library swells rapidly. Once you get started you have an immense world to explore.Go for it"
This app is Incredible. It has a lot of my favorite songs
"App review. I love this app, but sometimes the whole thing crashes. It logs me out, wont let me even access the app and it deletes my downloaded music and then i have to download it all again And when I was a student in 2018-19 I wasnt allowed to get the discount because it said the school i was enrolled in wasnt an actual school. So Ive been paying the $10 a month for about 5 years now i believe"
"Its the same. Very little interface developments since I first started using itafter a bit of a break,  I feel like it just doesnt get me anymore  (for example the algorithm might benefit by removing the songs that get skipped regularly- Thats what I really really want ) and it sometimes plays songs I like way too much, like it doesnt know what else to play, overkill  (not often, and potentially Ive skipped a few hundred tracks beforehand)But hey ho, Im still here and using it so must be doing something right -"
Very good. Paying for premium lets you download endless songs and podcasts and the biggest plus is the ad lady stops condescending you about not knowing what an 8-track is
Why its so good. Literally I cant do anything without music and u should listen to my track its best for friends its where ur friends would like it and like they would like the songs in it
STOP PLAYING SUGGESTED TRACKS. 3/5 for the suggested tracks
Its good. This app is incredible dont you think It is amazing app you should get it. It gives you every single song you know I love it you just need it get it
"Great app. Great music app, low data consumption, ads arent annoying if youre on the free version.Last couple app versions are crashing out of nowhere, I can listen to a couple of songs and the app crashes. Have no idea why"
"Ehhhhh. Not going to lie the music is good but the app is constantly crashing on me and its not even my wifi. I have great WiFi at my house and unlimited data, yet no matter where I am the app crashes. Its not just a one time this either it will crash 20 times in the spam of 10 minutes and then be fine for a few hours. Maybe they will fix this and I will be able to listen to my music without have to stop what Im doing all the time and reopen the app"
"Download to Apple Watch please. Great app, want the ability to download songs to Apple Watch"
Is hella laggy. I downloaded the music to my app watch and the only way to actually listen to it is if its not download to the app watch fix it
"Trouble loading. This is the only app that struggles to load whether on WiFi or data, sometimes songs wont play at all. The app is updated but it still struggles"
Suggested tracks. Please stop adding suggested tracks in my playlist its really annoying and most of the time I dont know those songs or if youre gonna add them have then play after ALL the song in my playlist ENDS please
"Was good. Ok I have had the premium package. At first it was amazing but now it has stopped playing my downloaded songs without wifi. And it keeps lagging even with wifi, I need data to play songs. And it keeps automatically pausing songs"
"Broken. Was a great app and easy to use, now every other  update it shuts it self down on me, then refused to open. Even when I re-download"
"Wheres the send to Apple Watch support?. Im a premium subscriber for a very long time. Watch and app etc are all up to date but theres no send to Apple Watch functionality. It was announced back in May that it would be available for premium subscribers, but I dont have access. Whats going on? I can download Apple Music right now and get this feature, which is just so useful for a runner"
"Needs update. Cuts out/skips like a scratched CD (regardless on using wifi/data or in the car, headphones or phone)"
"My podcasts arent working . I normally love this app and use it for music while I drive, and podcasts while I work.  But today I updated my payment info and when I logged back in I cant access any podcasts "
"Only here for the Last Podcast Network. I never would have downloaded this app without LPOTL, as I dont listen to music often. But, I do appreciate this app for allowing me to listen to my favorite shows (Last Podcast, Wizard and the Bruiser, and Page 7) with minimal push notifications and very few pressures to download a paid version of the app.So thanks I can listen to random Weezer albums and the cartoon Heavy Metal soundtrack when Im super drunk... but I can also listen to my podcasts on normal days without you guys trying to sell things to me Even ads are easily skippable during shows, as they make them a separate audio file that play at intervals in the show"
Playhead is MICROSCOPIC. Hey guys it is PAINFUL to scrub the track to a specific time because the playhead is MICROSCOPIC. I have to fish around for it for a CENTURY before I can move it around please for the love of chri$t fix it
AMAZING . They have songs from pop to country. They also have anime music. (I am a anime weeb) I love how you can download music so it doesnt use any data. This is the best music app in the world of apps. 
"Great but one request. This is the best music I can find its all free works great no problems or anything however, I do wish it didnt always need WiFi or Data that way I could listen whenever but overall I love it "
Really good app. I have been using this for a couple days and there is no ads because it uses cellular data or Wi-Fi didnt try it with wifi but over all its a good app
Good app but Im having a problem. Its a good app but Im having a problem when ever I want to listen to a certain song or album it will just be a track of songs that arent even apart of the album
"Too frequent as well as too many advertisements. Music is great.  Enjoy all genres and have always found what Im looking for.   The reason I rated three stars: ads are supposed to be every thirty minutes, it is more like twenty to twenty five minutes.  Second reason being have to listen to three or four ads that Im not interested in.   Realize that I could pay a monthly fee, Im in a nursing home and am left with $50.00 per month for personal needs, nothing leftover for entertainment.  "
"#MyLife. If you don&#39;t have this app... you sleeping boo. Best ish Eva. New songs, exclusive clips from artists... I&#39;m my own personal DJ. And the recommended stations are lit tooo"
plz stop with the repeats. Yeah I like this app but you play the same stuff just stop that mess just so doggone annoying and it s**ks that you gotta open now playing view if you wanna hit the like button on a song plz fix that and add more suggested tracks and no  frequent repeats and I&#39;ll fix my review
I love it but there are a few issues. This app is amazing but since the update I can only shuffle play u cant download tracks anymore I hope that come back I really miss the old version
Such an incredible app. I like how this app is like a improved pandora but also like how you can skip music without waiting for a add like in pandora
Unable to turn off video. In this day and age the fact that you can not turn off videos on podcasts is crazy. It drains your battery and data
Super Duper great. Hey guys you want to download this app right now its great 
My rating. Has too many ads and needs WiFi Im a teen and I cant get premium so its not that great so i dont really like it it also uses up too much data
Crash. Anytime I open the app with my data on. It closes (iPhone XS )
"Adds. Very good but if you are paying for data you then have to pay for premium so you dont get adds, for me I think thats too much but if you are rich you can afford it :)"
"First time use. Totally new to this, but overwhelmed, have no idea which artist or track, all I know is what I recognise when I hear it. Its easy to open the camera app for a snapshot but when it comes to music, all I want is the equivalent when Im out and about to listen to the ambience and add to my playlist in an instant before I miss the moment"
App is good. Not the functionality. So the app is alright but no button is working. I cant delete a playlist I cant remove download. I can make it private. I saw another review that said it was their phone being on a charger though for me they just wont work
FIX THIS APP NOW ITS F$@%ING NOT LOADING. ITS NOT LOADING AT ALL AFTER CLICKING ON AN ARTIST...FIX THIS BUG ONCE AND FOR ALL...UGHHH ITS SO F***** ANNOYING WHEN NOTHING SHOWS ANYTHING AFTER  I CLICK ONE OF THE ARTIST...IT WOULDNT WANNA F***** SHOW ANYTHING EVEN WHEN I TRY HAVING WIFI ON AND MY DATA ON THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE APP
"Horrible ads. The ad assumed I didnt know what an 8 track looks like, way to be ageist ....Oh and it randomly stops and wont start again until much later"
Review. Its great Accept it claps ya data enni buh other from tha its good
Terrible dont get. So I would create a playlist with like 30 songs on it and all it would do is play suggests track and I couldnt even hear 1 song from myPlaylist                      DONT DOWNLOAD
"Buggy. Great selection of music, but the recent update has it crashing at random with no distinctive cue. Ads are expected with freemium but far too often in between tracks. Not to mention unwanted additions to playlists youve personally made for your own use. Theres already a suggested song playlist, the Discover Weekly. Please leave it at that"
App on Apple Watch. Unable to download songs on my Apple Watch
"Amazing. The app is not bad in any way at all, the fact that you can download songs on the go is incredible, however I dont really like the fact that I have to pay 9.99 a month, wish it was a bit lower"
"Glitching. I have premium that I pay for, it is paid as of yesterday. For the past few weeks the app constantly glitches out and stops playing my music. I have turned off my data and my wifi to see if that was the problem. and I have deleted and downloaded the app back into my phone and restarted my phone and it still glitches"
Easy downloading. I now have everything I had on 8 track. Nice
What happened?. Only certain tracks play from my downloaded songs.... also if my playlist is in shuffle it only shuffles thru the last like 15 songs I added??
Playlists. I have downloaded my favourite tracks for few years and love that I can capture quickly my all time favourites that I can use time and time again
50 yr old male loves this app. Ultimate app. So easy to use that even someone with limited skills can put together awesome playlists. Get this app it will change your music listening habits. Great feature is being able to mix tracks seamlessly into the next to max the bespoke DJ feel - live it and love it  With money tight I have as to just use the ad freebie version. Wish I could afford Premium - so worth it  Peace & love
Terrible for Podcasts. Listening to longer podcasts? Expect issues. The app will lose track of your spot in the podcast if you transition from listening just on your phone and you move to a car or something. Then happens again when you disconnect from your car
"Good app, to many ads. Really well made app, but the long ads every 2 songs is incredibly frustrating, especially considering how overpriced it is for premium. Go with 8 tracks or some other player for less frustration on that front"
Joe Rogan Exp. Having a hard time getting the episodes to play.  When they do they are chewing through my data plan too.  Not a big deal on WiFi - but going down the road it is a problem which will prevent me listening
Business is personal. A great podcast - listen in to get great ideas how to move forward in your business. Rhys is extremely personal and relatable to what you may be facing running your small business
"Option for video off?. Dont use up all my data on video, when I only want the audio. Also, whats with the fast forward 15 and reverse 15? Isnt reliable. Jumps around. Overcast was more reliable, and more straightforward. You have the best. Now do the rest"
THE BEST APP IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD. Hey matesYou should download this app.Why? Because I told you to. It is so amazing. I cant live without it
"So Incredible. This changed my life, I love that you can go out of the app and listen to your songs. In fact Im listening to Alamo by Alec Benjamin while writing this. So five stars from me"
"Incredible. So much more convenient than my 1900 Vinyl Albums Can pick any song when I want to hear it Dont have to worry about any damage to my Albums starching or warped. Need a place to store 1900 Albums.And mess with the equipment to play the vinyl albums on                                     Im free to hand my vinyl Ablums down to my daughter.                                Not having to file thru all my Albums to find what I want to listen to              Again the storage ability is incredible It took me about 20-25 years to collect.... Classic Rock,Blues, Jazz,Classical and everything far and few in between? My Son gave her to me as a Christmas present..             The Best thing to come out of 2020 FOR ME"
Not free. FREE DOWNLOAD just need to enter your CC info here
"Always has bugs. When it works, it works great. But when it has the slightest issue, the whole app wont work. I always have full bars of data and it can barely stream a song. I update the app and the next day its back to bugs and not working. I have the brand new iPhone so no issues there. Just an app that doesnt consistently work like it used to last year"
Music. The only thing for me I hate is the suggested tracks. I wish there was and option that we could use to not play them
"Podcasts. Every time its a issue with podcasts on desktop or iPhone. Everything else streams perfectly fine but this is getting annoying. Cant disable video mode (unless using data saver), podcasts restart when you open the app, on desktop after awhile you leave full screen it stays stuck on the software so you cant scroll unless you exit and open the desktop app"
App is broken. I just upgraded my phone and downloaded the app and now I get factory app logo and application will not let me access it it just keeps saying something went wrong its crap
I love it. Ive been using this app since it came out Never had problems with it. Its incredible
"Buggy Apple Watch support. I used to be able to control playback with my Apple Watch but now the Watch app only says, Play something to see tracks here. And this is with something playing. All of my other watch apps, including Apples Podcasts app work fine"
"Random Crashes. I deleted the cache, reloaded the app, turned  off bluetooth and data... but it will continue to crash randomly. It will play music for 2 minutes tops then just stop. Sometimes it will go a solid day without crashing; on other days it will crash every 2 minutes. (Yes, I do have the latest update)That only brings it down one star though. Otherwise this app is great for music and podcasts. I think the free version is generous enough to justify it being downloaded, but I am seriously considering getting premium because the app is just that good.I hope the crashing issue gets resolved, but excellent app anyways"
Messed. My phone got hacked through this app
Great but. Ill be listening to a song and out of no where the song just stops. Dead in its tracks. And closes the app all together. And when I try to listen to another song i have I skip the one that stopped in order to continue listening. And itll still shut the app off
Podcast mode sucks and is clunky. When you download podcasts offline it still uses your data to play and wont play without data turned on and wont play with low cell phone signal.  Garbage for podcast which sucks because Joe Rogan is there now.  Also it used up all my cell data even though I downloaded the podcast to play it.  What a piss-off
Joe Rogan. Require Joe Rogan to back up all his fake claims with in depth research. Make him show studies and hard data proving their claims. Also require him to interview experts that dispute his claims
. Well first of all I havent downloaded it yet so I dont know what to expect. But as Im reading the reviews Im not so sure anymore. Im only downloading it for the sad music I love on it. Please tell me Im not wasting like 5G of data for all the bad reviews for the app. I want to test it out and see how it goes. Who knows it might be bad or it might be ok. I hope Im not wasting time and energy for this. 
help. the app keeps crashing when using wifi or data but it doesnt crash when im not using wifi or data. the problem im having is that i deleted the app because it wasnt working to reinstall it but now i cant sign back in. i need music for my anxiety so im really stuck
Overall good with some complaints. As long as Im connected to a reliable wifi connection then all the features work great. However on phone data I usually have problems with podcasts loading in a timely manner
"Random non-play?. I love the app and i have a family plan but in the last month it is only playing the first twelve seconds of majority of my music (i checked on most of them). I have restarted my phone, logged in and out, and deleted and downloaded the app multiple times and it still doesnt work. it will work on web player and on my computer but for some reason its refusing to work on my phone. Im not sure if anyone else has this issue but i know i am"
"CANT LIVE WITHOUT MUSIC   VERY PRECIOUS . Music INCREDIBLE , SPECIAL , PRECIOUS MEMORIES MUSIC IS MAGICAL , HYPNOTIC , MESMERIZING ,WITH IT REALLY UNBELIEVABLE , UNDERSTANDING , THE MEANING OF LIVING A UNFORGETTABLE SO VERY SPECIAL LIFE , WITHOUT MUSIC YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE A PERSON TOTALLY EMPTY , NO EMOTIONS , HOW SAD IT IS   MARCELL  J .  ROBERT  , BARRIE , ONTARIO CANADA  "
Something for Everyone. Incredible music app. So easy to use. Loads of Genres and even Playlists. So good
Data hog. Two episodes of Rogan = 40 gigabytes
So worth it. This app is incredible definitely worth the money
Songs wont play. It wont play any of my like songs so Im having to go through and unlike all of my songs and playlist so I can listen to them Ive tried everything with cellular data options and downloading the songs onto my phone but nothing works
I cant access the app. I pay for premium and this morning every time I loud up Im getting kicked off and I cant even get on the app Deleted and re downloaded didnt work any help
"Good for making playlists. ive been using this  since like 2017, and i love it, although, ill get up to( im not joking) 10-12 ads instead of 2-4. also, the suggested tracks they add onto you playlist are quite annoying"
Better shuffle. Get a better shuffle mix of your personal playlist. To many repeats when playing any playlist of mine
Omg . Its the best.The music is probably one of the best things Ive ever heard its as well the most incredible how it has so much music in such a small app and yeah I should just buy the app its not too hard to set up and yeah
Watch downloads can never be played. The download feature for the Apple Watch is laughably poor. The watch app works maybe 10% of the time if youre lucky
Feedback. Too many interruptions not even getting through a whole track without COVID info
"Not intuitive. This app is not intuitive. If Im following a podcast through the app and select to be notified of new episodes, it should display that when I launch. Not the most recent tracks I listened to"
"No audio only option for podcast. Please fix soon for those on limited data. I dont need to watch rogans bald head, just listen"
"Deserves a 6 star. Incredible service, for a 15 second ad. This platform has every song ever written, and has amazing sound quality. Also, the additional feature of stations or radios of a related song you like can expand your bases"
Stahp. I&#39;m just tryna listen to Louis Tomlinson bruh stop interrupting my playlists with the suggested tracks  stream Walls y&#39;all 
"Awesome. Great app, build personal play lists, daily suggestions based upon preferences, thank you"
"Needs download page back. Cant see a list of my downloads, needs WiFi or data to view lists of podcasts even if they are downloaded"
AWESOME. an incredible app it has everything its entirely free and the songs are unlimited
Amazing. Its amazing for when ever you want to  just be in the car and enjoy music and even though that it uses a lot of my data it MUCH MUCH better then Apple Music for sureAnd creating your own playlist is so much easier (Im my experience) then Apple Music Hope that you also agree and give it a go some time soon its AMAZING
Is very nice. I like cause its spend a little bit móvils data and when choose another App the the song keep goingThe App suggests other similar bands
Amazing. This app is incredible with premium defenetly recomend
Fantastic. Just being able to download favourites and mot to have to listen to tracks youre not keen on an album 
Podcast and Music Front Runner. Love the access to incredible podcasts of personal interests and my favorite music uninterrupted
"Audio and Video?. There is a data saver button and an audio only button which I have activated. Yet when I go to listen to JRE there is the video and it takes 10-15 minutes to download and it gets choppy as the listening overtakes the download. Why why why? Is it too much to ask?  Have removed the app, reinstalled it later (hoping), find out nothing has improved, remove it again. You have stolen Joe Rogan from me"
"Terrible. The music ALWAYS no matter if i have good wifi or data it always cuts out a few seconds after being played, never works right"
No songs Tab. There should be a songs tab downloaded tab  and you should be able to sort your track list
"All songs have disappeared from Liked Songs. Just updated the app, now there are NO songs on my liked songs playlist. There are green hearts on songs when i look them up, but now they are not all compiled into the liked songs playlist anymore. Is this a glitch? Years worth of saved songs all gone (thank god i made some personal playlists). Can you please fix this? I feel like each  update to this app is making it worse and more complicated. Why fix what doesnt need fixing?"
10 year old kid said this. This is such a incredible app because it has all different songs soo please get it I am 10 years old but sill please get it
Music app. Cool app but u cant skip  any tracks of the music
Incredible app. As a music addict and the selections songs is awesome just love the app no words
Awsome i love. It has so many songs.I go on walks alot and I can just listen to the the incredible music  Im in love  with this app
"Every song wont play. Every song plays the first ten seconds and stops, then I have to skip to the next song and then go back to the original song to be able listen to in its entirety the next song after it does the same regardless if its a downloaded song or Im on WiFi or data"
"Has become harder to use on mobile. Not only is there the issue of it playing 4 adds before you can even get to a song, and THEN only listening to one maybe 3 minute song before it instantly gives you another 3 adds, but it also in my personal experience has been closing and restarting constantly while Im using it. Its closed 4 times in the same hour, and when Ive tried giving in a break for a few hours and then going back it once again restarts"
Great listening. So nice to have music tailored to personal taste
"Buggy Lately - makes me sad. When connected to WiFi or using data, a song will play for a few seconds and then stop. I try to switch to a different song and nothing plays. App also gets stuck in the search screen after tapping an artist or playlist. The only way Ive been able to resolve this is by deleting the app and re-installing. :("
Updated but still broke ios. Updated on cellular data 130mb and still app crashes on entry. Cheers for wasting my data
Doesnt work half the time offline. Pauses songs after 10 seconds and will not play. The bill was paid but it says offline without wifi or data and does not work. Great app when it works but half the time it doesnt
"Cant open the app. The app keeps closing as I attempt to listen to my fire tracks, why?? Ive reinstalled it multiple times"
Great . Its so easy to access and put songs on it even takes the data of the songs you have been listening to an puts them all together I love how many podcasts I can put on my favourite under the influence from CBC radio so good
Offline listening is a myth. I wasted time and data downloading a library that never loads without a solid internet connection. Im thankful Netflix works just fine on flights
BEST ONE. Easy to use and u can find any musicthe thing i love the most is the way this app make albums depends on our track listreally loved it
I only have this app for Rogan. The app loses track of where the podcast left off constantly. It wont restart the playback after the phone reads texts messages. Says the episode isnt available far too frequently. If Rogan didnt have an exclusive deal I would never use this app
"I love it. This is amazing Especially during quarantineI just listen to my personal playlist with 200 of my favorite songs, put my AirPods in, and go outside and dance it out LOL. I can also listen to podcasts, but I choose not to. Its just not my thing, but hey, to each their own, right? Anyways, highly recommend"
Premium not working off line. I love this app but for the past couple of days it wont work off line. The reason I pay for this app is so I can listen to music while off line and not have to use my data. I have an iPhone XR and there was a resent update. Could that be the problem? Also my account is in good standing so I know that isnt the problem. Please fix this I cant pay for something Im not receiving
"Exceptional Information, if you are have TBI. As someone who has suffered for the past 4 years because of TBI & PTSD. This is reassuring that there is new research"
The latest version keeps quitting. Nov 18 2021The latest version of this great app keeps stopping and closing on my iPhone XR.I have full WiFi/data. cant make it through a whole song.Fix this you guys.Plz and thanks
Enjoyment. I cant explain how good this app is and useful it is. Like for example if Im trying to listen to music or specifically a sound track. I dont have to pay or anything. This app saves a lot of time and you can make your own play list
"App hasnt worked since I restored my phone. Songs are downloaded but I cant listen to them. The music either doesnt play or only plays for 6 secs before pausing and not responding. Only seems to work if I play using my data, but not WiFi"
Downloaded songs not playing. Some songs even if downloaded are not playing when no wifi/data available. Just a silence
"Wish there was an alternative. The only game in town I fortunately - search is weak, downloaded songs for    Off line use often disappear, and artist info is minimal"
"History of listening to music. I had a crystal radio, sold my car for my first consul stereo, didnt get into eight tracks that much but was really heavy into cassettes and was a fan of them from the time they came out till the 90s. Scratchy 45s, scratchy albums, trying to edit out clicks and pops. Late arrival arrival to the digital revolution, lots of CDs. I dont think the artists get their share of the pie, but having the world of music at the end of your fingertips is very addictive"
Anyone else has this bug?. So I can\'t play artist tracks. Like when u click the artist and click play. It won\'t let me. Someone help. I\'ve already tried restarting my phone and opening/closing the app. Help
"Love love love this app. On this app you can lesson to all your favorite songs for example watermelon auger high my personal fav you can lesson to savage you can lesson to your favorite bands like one direction,five seconds of summer and much more Im just pointing out that this app is so good I love it and you should to bye Thanks for lessoning "
Glitch. Its great except for a bug that even when on wifi or data and I have a playlist already downloaded it says Im offline and wont load my songs
Offline mode doesnt even work. I dont have data so I bought premium and most of my downloads wont even play they say they are downloaded but wont even play. Just go to Apple Music
"pretty good. really sad they took away the ability to see when a playlist was made since ive had the app since 2017 and have over 800 playlists and i would use the dates to track how my music taste changed based on different things happening in my life at the time, still prefer it over other apps though"
"App not functioning. Have deleted and reinstalled app and restarted phone and used data but app refuse to open, without shutting down immediately after opening"
Stop before I slap u. I like it but stop putting suggested tracks
"Poor connection. Downloaded playlist wont play on mobile data, only on wifi"
Good. Good but you have to have WiFi or data. (Better than Pandora)
"Randomly stops playback. Unless I have the app open and my screen on, it randomly stops playing after a minute or two and when I reopen the app it goes back to the first few seconds of the track. Its very annoying"
Apple Watch. Needs offline access for Apple Watch
"This has gotten old. I have to restart the app after every track. Its not a Wi-Fi/cellular/Bluetooth issue. This is the only app this happens to. A track starts to play, then stops. It doesnt start playing again on it own. Skipping th track doesnt help. It just stops. I have to close the app. Restart it. Then the track picks up. Every. Time. All the time. Im a paying subscriber. Can someone please explain to me what I need to do. Maybe delete the app and use something else?"
Bugs. A few bugs appeared after update on mobile:1. I can no longer see the track or artist name in minimized view - only the album name appears.2. There is a huge blank at the top of the artist page where the artist name and photo used to be (neither show up now).Please fix. Thank you
"Randomly shuts off. App shuts off randomly during a song , full WiFi strength with data turned on. This has just recently started to happen"
Best music app out there. Easy to use keeps track of what you listen to and gives I good playlist suggestions been using it for 5 years it reaaaallllyy know my music taste now
No more Joe Rogan. Get rid of the False info guy already
Its great. I love it so much. Music is like my own personal therapy. I got premium as soon as I could it had a very large abundance of music I recommend it very much
"Worst app. Probably the worst app Ive ever used. Always crashing and freezing. You can rewind or ff 15 seconds and itll take you back 45 minutes. Also, you can download a podcast, but when you play it itll still use data. How can a downloaded episode buffer?"
"Songs not playing. When I click on a song it wont play, regardless of if Im using wifi or data, some songs work and some dont play at all, soooo frustrating"
" Amazing application . Incredible app, don&#39;t think I need to explain further"
Maxing out data. Cant maintain an offline library. CONSTANTLY re-downloads entire library at over 50Gb
"Godsend. Ive used this for 8 years and have downloaded thousands of tracks, brilliant"
"Your beautiful GUI is definitely noticeable. Simply beautiful   Update Request: It would be wicked cool if you guys would add a feature, that would allow adding podcast shows or favorite radio stations to the Home Screen, kinda how youre able to do that with personal playlists.  Because sometimes while driving you want to pull up a quick radio mix or a juicy podcast to sink your teeth in, without having to hunt for it throughout the app"
"Podcasts. Not a good app for listening to podcasts. Always downloads video content along with audio which kills your data allocation. Podcasts, for most, are for listening to not for viewing. Goodbye JRE"
Variety. I enjoy the variety of music - especially the Weekly Discovery playlist which appears to have adapted to my taste in jazz and blues. Also some good options such as downloading for offline listening and the option for high resolution download when data usage isnt an issue
Incredible. Love how you have the choice of normal or premium. Love this music and podcast app
"Not working on 4G. For me, this app only works on WiFi. Doesnt work on 4G. Ive tested all, speed is perfect but on mobile data it only streams for 3-5 seconds then stops"
incredible. just need less ads but other than that had this app since i was 9 and im 14 now
Technical Issues Constantly. Title says it. Fix this app so its not so glitchy its annoying. Ill be listening to a podcast episode then out of nowhere a totally different episode will interrupt and start playing. The whole app is glitchy. AND STOP ASKING ME I AGREE TO TRACKING MY ANSWER IS NO
"Awesome. Its amazing I can play songs while playing games and it has a very wide range of songs, my personal favourite ones are all the MOTHER MOTHER songs. BEST APP EVER"
"HELP, I love it, but theres a problem. I really love this app, I listen to all my music/podcasts on it HOWEVER I started having a problem where a song plays for 5-10 seconds and then pauses. No matter what I do, I cant fix it. Have reinstalled the app, logged out, force restart my phone, everything It will not stop pausing my music. It does this on WiFi or data, with and without headphones plugged in, with and without Bluetooth, and with and without being plugged into the car Its SO ANNOYING Im so upset cause this is the only app I use and I cant even use it"
"Randomly shuts off. Love the idea of the app. Almost to the point where I would pay for the premium version EXCEPT for the fact that it will randomly stop playing sometimes. In the middle of a podcast, middle of a song, playlist etc. when you open it back up its where you originally started (for instance: in a podcast you picked back up at 15 min into it, it shut off after 2 min and when you open it back up its back to the 15 min mark not 17, like you never listened to this minutes). And what are the only fixes that are ever suggested? Turn phone off and back on or delete and reinstall the app. What a terrible bug and even worse fixes. My app is up to date and I have turned the phone off and back on but I refuse to delete the app (losing my data) and reinstall it. If thats the best option then I will do the deleting but not the reinstall"
Adds + Skips. Love it.But the adds r so annoying and u cant skip that much.But premium allows u to skip and no adds its 6 dollars each month it personal dont think its worth it maybe u do
"Done. Since they are backing Joe Rogan I am done with them. It my personal opinion, I could change it"
"No option to download to Apple Watch. Even though they announced this feature will be available to premium users , Im still not seeing the option to download to Apple Watch yet"
Acc hacked again. There is something wrong when an app continues to get hacked. I recently bought a paid account and within one week my account has been hacked and logged in from Russia and China. Fix your security issues and stop allowing accounts to be hacked. Also please give refunds to those who dont want to continue using the app because of security issues
Video support?. Its incredible we still cant get native video support for Rogans show on the Apple TV app or via AirPlay.  Yall spent a lot of dough for that exclusive and are really missing the boat on the video aspect of his show
"Great app but could use minor improvements. I HATE that when playing daily playlist, the Lock Screen controls change. I want/need to be able to go to previous track from the Lock Screen. Instead, what should be a previous button changes to a hamburger menu where you can add or remove the track from your library. What good is that?"
"THANKS. Always a good go to whenever I feel like it, unlike other music apps its the quickest and in my personal opinion along with a lot of other ones, the best"
"Podcast troubles. I cant download a podcast without adding it to my personal episodes, but I can add a podcast to my episodes without downloading it. This app is very quirky, pretty good anyways"
"Absolutely incredible. First of all I want to start with the amount of songs there are in this app, if I search up a song its there. Secondly this app has playlists so that you can list the songs in different places: say you want a George Ezra playlist, you can find his songs and add them to your playlist. Also you can listen to song when you are away from the app, your phone is off and connect it to a speaker, its amazing. So if you are looking for a music app were you just want to listen to music and relax, while saving a ton of battery, I completely recommend this for you"
"Good, but offline mode sucks. Its good. Offline mode sucks. I sometimes need to turn on my data to get a downloaded podcast to start. Also, why dont they have an option to autodownload a podcast I have to download every week?"
"Whats going on??. Not sure whats happened since the recent update. Some albums play fine, some stop after one track and completely stop if you try to skip tracks? Driving me insane"
Shsh. Bring personal and human connection to the Discover Weeklys
Why cant I see the number of tracks in a playlist anymore?. Can you please add the number of tracks in a playlist to be included in the playlist information?
Question from Vince. Is it possible to do something about the widely varying sound levels of different tracks? I suppose this is a result of each track being recorded at a different level
"Incredible App, Only One Issue:. As stated in the title, this app is amazing, superior to other free music apps in almost all ways. My one issue with it is this: While listening to music, whether the app is open or running background, the music will inevitably stop after half an hour - an hour. Not only that, but if I go to open the app again, it will reboot, and the song will restart. This in itself would not be a massive issue if it did not instantly repeat as soon as the song was over. This bug prevents me from doing work while listening to music on my phone due to the fact that I need to restart the app completely after each individual song. If this were fixed, the app would be nearly flawless in the large"
"You messed up joe rogans cast. Like many others I came to listen to joes podcast. I dont want to watch or be forced to download a video too. I like to download 2/3 episodes for work. THEY ARE NOW GIGS EACH. What the hell. Listen should be the default. Cant use a months data in a day or flatten my battery having unwanted vid playing in my pocket. Till you sort this crap, no more joe for me. Shadow of the app you once had"
Watch app wont download songs. The phone app works fine but the watch app is missing a major feature. Every time I try to download songs to use offline on my watch (so I can leave my phone at home on a run) it refuses to download them or literally takes days to do so (I have a very fast Wi-Fi connection) then it constantly plays the wrong some when I select one on the watch. Ive even kept everything up to date. After googling it seems to have been a problem for over a year now. They still havent fixed it
Get rid of the adds. Not happy with all the adds that come on between tracks Get enough of them on radio and TV  Cheers
"Pretty Good. This app is pretty good. The music collection is good, not a problem with that. Few suggestions, I would really welcome the addition of a scrollbar in all of the playlists (Currently its only available in the Liked songs section). Also, I would love to see the number of tracks in a playlist rather than seeing who created it. Thanks Update : In the latest update, I am unable to turn on and off shuffle and repeat"
"3 Star first. Not eally sure what you going to use the information I have shared for, other than that you work well when the premium is paid. Reviews are on going, yes"
Update Broken. Used your amazing app for many years without a problem. Most recent update now crashes anytime I turn on cellular data. Works fine in offline mode. Will update rating when this is fixed
Great place to find free music. I like because it is great to listen to any where any time the only down side is if you dont you dont have WiFi or data you cant listen to music.  But it is great
Great app. This app is incredible and I personally love it. The app has many good songs and podcasts along with relaxing sounds. The free version is perfect if you dont want to spend money but I would recommend buying the premium.Overall I think that this app is incredible
Sick man. Very personal
Wish I could see lyrics. Incredible app that I use daily. Just wish there was a way to see song lyrics so I can learn the lyrics without have to use youtube or google
Great until recently. Cuts out mid song for no reason when on wifi or data. Needs a new update
"Pretty Good. This app is pretty good. The music collection is good, not a problem with that. Few suggestions, I would really welcome the addition of a scrollbar in all of the playlists (Currently its only available in the Liked songs section). Also, I would love to see the number of tracks in a playlist rather than seeing who created it. Thanks"
"Randomly and frequently stops playing songs a few seconds in. Why is this app so buggy?  It very frequently and for no apparent reason will stop playing songs two to six seconds in, and the only solution is to either restart the app or skip to the next track"
"An Awesome app and a possible suggestion. This is without a doubt the greatest music app out there, with its amazing system and the personal suggestions and playlists. If I could add one thing it would be to be able to add your own personal Equaliser settings.  Each set of headphones are different and the ability to save each settings for an individual set would be amazing. Then you could swap easily between one that optimises your headphones to one that best suits your speakers"
Good app. Only suggestion would be adding a genre tab to personal library music because sometimes I just want a certain genre
Terrible app for podcasts. I cant listen to Joe Rogan with video.  I travel for work and love listening to podcasts. This app forces me to use video which eats up my data. Please add audio option only. Thanks
Not happy. Get rid of Joe Rogan stop spreading fake information and Ill soon be gone otherwise
"Plays fine, but Apple Watch doesnt keep up. The Apple Watch always loses track of what song is playing a few songs in"
"Not connecting. it keep on saying, no internet connection wherein my data is open"
Top notch music. I use it mostly for backing tracks and for rock out in my carGreat
Quits and Freezes. Works good when working. However continues to quit or freeze on advertisements. iOS operating system. Needs more selection on older music like Johnny Horton. Have to go to another app for some of his music. Good rock selection and pop and country otherwise. Need more Linda Ronstadt concert music added. Thats my personal choice. 80s concert rocks. Hard to contact support
Frustrating. Added songs I dont like to my playlist and cant access tracks in playlist
Gooood. I like it cause its free and doesnt ask for information just download it and get started
"Current app version suddenly nonfunctional. When connected to the internet, this app now crashes the moment it is launched (both over wifi and mobile data, with and without VPN). While in airplane mode, it cannot access its own memory storage. I have 13gb+ of stored music still taking up space on my phone, but the app now thinks nothing is cached (but has grey arrows to indicate what it knows should be downloaded).Everything is fully up to date (and has been for a while). Phone restarts and app reinstallation did not resolve.I hope they fix it all soon.iOS 13.5.1, iPhone 11"
"Review. Such an incredible app I get to utilize to spend time with my family and oaky amazing music and podcast, comedy and so many other thingsThank you"
"Crashes all the time for me. Recently this app has started to crash at most four times(??) a session, sometimes I even have to kill the app and reboot it. Besides that Ive been using Spotify for YEARS. This has been a problem only recently, and its not internet connection issues because it crashes / randomly pauses + restarts the song when Im on data or wifi. If they could somehow fix this Id give a full star review, I love this app but this crashing issue has gotten out of hand"
"IT HAS A BUG. It used to work fine.  But now, it absolutely refuses to download my podcast episodes.  Shame.  The one reason I downloaded the app"
"So much crashing. When its an ad or a corporate artist with a million plays, the app works great. When its an independent artist who needs every spin they can get, the app crashes. And crashes. And crashes 10 more times. Doesnt matter what WiFi or data youre on or what device youre using, the crashes keep coming"
Bugging lately. Stops mid tracks for me and several other people using the app
"URGENT PSA. I can not stop playing the latest track added to the loop. I choose not to. Positions is set to blow through all the ceilings. Its what our time needs, positive family vibes with a twist of Mrs. Grey.2Lincolns(¢) Unwarranted from this SUPER FAN"
"good but not good. Its good and easy to find music and listen but there are bad parts. 1.) the music keeps stopping for no reason. 2.) when i put on and album i want to listen to the album, not the suggested tracks. Other than that, the app is alright"
"Apple Watch. This app works on iPad iPhone and Apple Watch, true but ... its working on iPad on its own, its working on iPhone on its own but when it comes to Apple Watch then no, you must have it connected to your iPhone or have a cellular version watch with, which is important, active cellular data plan. So it does work on Apple Watch without a hassle of having either your phone or data plan with you. Not good for running and similar activity"
Enjoying this app. This app is the answer I was looking for to be able to listen toMusic and sleep without WiFi and data
Incredible. This app is apple music but free it is epic so DOWNLOAD ITTTTT
"newest fan. the ads used to annoy me but i appreciate this product so much in my life now, i love the diveristy of misic presented to me in the form of playlists, suggested tracks and even podcasts"
"Wont let me search. I keep trying to search songs and when it said it couldnt find it I thought that maybe that song wasnt on there but when I searched Billie Eilish a world known singer, it still said try another search, I used my data because I thought it might be a connection error but it was still the same, please fix this"
App Crashing on Launch. You guys broke the app on a recent update. Reinstall doesnt fix. Removing iCloud data doesnt fix. Cant use the service Im paying for. Refund?
"Playlist greyed out. Playlist greyed out, I pay premium, I have uninstalled and reinstalled and changed passwords and still doesnt play playlists Works when wifi is connected, I reset  the data as well"
It keeps getting worse. It keeps crashing and plays more suggested tracks than my actual playlists. It plays well it&#39;s just those issues that truly bother me
WONT PLAY. After 10 seconds my music stops playing even when it&#39;s downloaded and i&#39;m on WIFI and data downloads too and i pay for premium. please fix this this has been ongoing for 1 month now and i&#39;m tired of it
Crashing. App still closing after every single song. Randomly crashes on WiFi and regular data This is blowing me
Great app. Wish I could view album art while looking through playlists it  would make distinguishing tracks a little bit more easy. Its always just fun to be able to view the album artwork as well. Otherwise great app
"New update. I got the new update today and after it was finished, I wasnt able to access the app anymore. Just goes back to the home screen. I deleted the app and re downloaded it 5 times and even turned my phone off and on 3 times and it still wont work"
"Top five isnt enough. I cant speak on desktop, but on mobile we can only see the the top five most popular tracks from an artist. We need to be able to see at least the top 20 tracks. On the plus side, you get access so so many songs you could never afford when we were kids. Im learning new genres on the regular"
Shuffle. Why cant I shuffle the downloaded tracks in my library like iTunes??? I am finding it more and more difficult to engage with my downloaded music of late. A shuffle function would vastly improve this app
App sucks. Only use to listen to Rogan but every episode is a struggle to download. Most wont download and just play off data. Its funny the money you paid Rogan but your platform will barely handle a simple download
Apple Watch Downloads dont work. App force closes when trying to select downloaded playlist on Apply Watch
Hiiii. I love this app its incredible
Very handy and well made. This saves me a lot of money from iTunes and cds. I think this app is incredible and everyone should at least try it. Would recommend to a friend
Outstanding. This app is incredible All the music I need
Podcasts problems. The app works well overall but I have experienced significant problems with listening to podcasts. Podcasts often glitch or refuse to start. Sometimes the app loses track of where you left off
"Keeps stopping abruptly. Ive seen others have this problem as well and I wish there was a solution because it gets really annoying. I was going to go premium but this has put me off. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone and it does this when Im both on my WiFi and mobile data. I enjoy the daily mix playlist but if this issue of it stopping suddenly is fixed, then would get a 5 star from me"
"Crashes a lot. Data hungry on pod casts, doesnt always start where you left off on pod casts"
my favorite app. thank you for creating this marvelous app Its my favorite I have my own playlist which is the most incredible thing Thank you so much
My personal opinion. They are been so great to me whit all my Desire music only one think I dont appreciated that dont let you Pay the year in advance that will make my life easier
"Apple Watch downloaded playlists don't work. Not sure why my apple watch needs to connect to ... itself ... () to play music I already downloaded onto it. If I go on a run and forget to hit play before I get out of range of my phone, it won&#39;t work"
The new podcast format is ridiculous. I can&#39;t see what episodes I have downloaded in one feed so I guess I&#39;m going to have to mentally track how many of each I have downloaded now. Guess it&#39;s time to switch to Stitcher. Hopefully that is more seamless
My Personal Opinion. The whole student discount plus Hulu thing is the only reason Im still in school
"Cant even use my premium, may cancel. Ive had issues the last couple of days trying to get the app to stay open longer than half a second when opening it. I tried restarting the app, restarting my device, clearing data, uninstalling and reinstalling, the only time it stays open is when I have airplane mode on, which is useless because I cant log back in due to not keeping the app open. It would be one thing if this was a first occurrence, but it isnt"
Best music App Ever. Build flawless Playlists in minutes With access to ever imaginable track
Downloaded music not working. My downloaded music isnt working properly Certain songs wont play or will get 10 seconds in and stop playing even with my data is on it still wont work but if I search up a song that I dont have downloaded it will usually play with no issuesPlease help solve the issueThank you
Love my Personal mixes. Amazed by some of the tunes you dig up for my personal mixes. Great variety. Love them
Good App Needs a Couple New Features. This App would be a very good app if it had a shuffling feature so that were not Listening to the same tracks in the same order
This is app is incredible. This app is just wow Im speechless
"Amazing. It is a good app but the amount of ads is unnecessary, but asides that it is incredible"
"Essential app for music. Best place for banger tracks, love it"
Crashing on iPhone 12. Crashing every 2 mins on iPhone 12 with update. Only way to listen to a whole song is to turn off wifi and data then over heats phone
Yes. This app is truly amazing if you dont have data or any use of Wi-Fi you can just download the songs and you can play at any time Im only playing them when I go on planes are long journeys but I really like it
Hey. Watch this short video for 30 minutes of ad free listening
INCREDIBLE. I have enjoyed this app ever since I got it. Premium is defo worth it as well
New update terrible. Unable to play anything. New update does not recognize when connected to Wifi or mobile data so unable to play anything. Have tried to log out and back in to reset but now i am unable to log in. Not happy at all
Easily hacked. Be careful .... sad.... I really loved using it till I discovered I&#39;ve been hacked by many people
"App crashes when opened. Tried the usually close the app, restart the app, and clear data still crashes"
"AMAZING. I love the range of things you can listen to, from podcasts to top trending songs, this app is truly incredible I also love that you can express what music and stuff you aspire and listen to"
downloaded songs wont play. all my offloaded songs stopped working and stay at 0:00 even though the track shows its downloaded. this never happened before please fix it. im paying for premium and this premium feature isnt working
"Liked songs not syncing on iPad. I struggled to get liked songs syncing on iPad. Struggled as it is on my iPhone. I copied songs from a personal playlist using the desktop version onto my liked songs. I signed out and back in, deleted cache, closed the app. Nothing worked. Finally got it to sync by deleting the app on iPad and reinstalling it. It should not be this complicated. At least something worked"
"The app is glitching. Isnt optimized enough, every time Im going down in a playlist to play a music once I select the track the app sends me all the way up of the playlist and, something is wrong with the interface, the names of the playlists are just showing half of their names"
"Good without wifi. I love how this doesnt need WiFi to work Dont have to get subscriptions for other apps. I love how this is free and doesnt need wifi (I use data at work or while driving, very good). Thanks"
"Wifi. Works perfectly with data but it crashes with wifi, its been doing it for a long time.Needs an update so its stops crashing on wifi. Please update"
Justin tella. Always keeping up with new tracks and discovering new artists from all decades. Very educated on music history and pop culture
Wont open. This app was working perfectly fine and then it randomly wouldnt let me open it with data or wifi only offline so I cant even add new songs or nothing Ive tried reinstalling and it still wont open
Too many adds. In the middle of the first song and then the second and third. Its hard to enjoy the music or do anything with the music such as a personal practice of any sort. Not good because of all the advertisements
"Its complicated. Couldnt get it to play videos at first. Came back from time to time but no dice. Also, podcasts dont support video so I cant watch Rogan on my smart tv. Thats a deal breaker. I refuse to work that hard to watch Rogan"
"Not impressed. Downloaded this app recently to listen to some of the new podcasts.  Layout not nearly as nice as Apple.  Listened to episodes dont disappear and I dont like the giant list of podcasts.  Also dont like that I am downloading the entire video file of podcasts.  Dont need all that, just need audio.  Seems like a tremendous amount of data being funneled.  Takes forever to download even over WiFi"
Only works if you have Data turned on. If you have recently started to use the app for The JRE podcast. Its terrible. You download the podcast on wifi but can not listen to it unless you have your cellular data turned on. Always has a playback halted message. Need to turn Data on
"So great. So smooth and easy to use, pretty much every song you have ever wanted is on here. Incredible app. You gotta get it"
"Amazing. What a loveley app stress free and easy to listen to your favourite songs and a whole range of others too. One personal problem most of the good explisit songs has been taken off or remixes have been made, you dont get the same experience. But all in all very good app and would definateley recommend to others"
Almost great. Interface is a little crowded and unintuitive. Music doesnt resume sometimes after another app/notification steals audio focus
Music OK but Podcasts are bad and miss leading. Like the music but theres a lot of misleading info on podcasts Also not the easiest app to use for navigation
"Randomly pauses. I have used this song app for long, but now when I listen the track randomly stops and when I just try to unpause it, it automatically pauses. I dont know how to fix it"
"Hacked/password issues. When changing your password, someone can still have access to it. Even if you do not log out, Someone still have access to it. So changing your password does nothing"
"Great App. I love that there are live tracks available, as well as rare and obscure gems. I really enjoy the app but recently I am not able to see all the songs on an album. I can no longer click on the part that lists some songs and then says and more to show me the rest of the songs. Other than that I love the app and I really like the song suggestions the app gives me"
Bugs. App crashed daily. It happens when I go from WiFi to data. So when I listen to music in my car it crashes every time
"Built in radio feature is repetitive. I use the app on a very regular basis, love the operating system, and the utility of it. Most of the time its incredibly convenient to just leave playing. The system for the radio based on used to be really good, it would recommend songs similar to whatever was playing before. Now it only plays the same tracks on repeat no matter what I was listening to before. Its frustrating how similar the playback is too, its playing an almost identical set every time, not even songs I would usually listen to. Every time one comes on I think Oh the playlist is over now, guess I should go change it and its so repetitive. Please fix this so Im not hearing the same three tracks after any playlist is over. This review is written entirely for the development team. For users: Best streaming software on the market, 5 out of 5 stars.I have screenshots of the constant re occurring tracks, some of them are songs Ive liked, but obviously they are overplayed now"
"Pretty good. I wish the log in issues werent a thing, first it tells me I have to connect to WiFi to listen then I troubleshoot and figure out that I have data enabled and I need to re sign in and the app is not responding to my log ins but the web player is why?"
Quits and Freezes. Works good when working. However continues to quit or freeze on advertisements. iOS operating system. Needs more selection on older music like Johnny Horton. Have to go to another app for some of his music. Good rock selection and pop and country otherwise. Need more Linda Ronstadt concert music added. Thats my personal choice. 80s concert rocks. Hard to contact support. Still fails. Now cannot get it to work at all. Uninstalled and Reinstalled. Will not work. Latest operating system. All updates done
Great good quality. This is great if u have minutes or data its great if u do t then buy premium or what ever its called and its really cool just to listen to music it great
Amazing . I love this app. Its so good and the music quality is incredible
Great app. Honestly it has any songs I ever wanted and it&#39;s amazing I love it it&#39;s incredible I hope one day I can have the actual version of the app for now I gotta be with an older version cause of course I&#39;m with an older iPhone it&#39;s fine tho I still listen to my music and I enjoy the app all the time thanks to the people who made the app u guys have done great continue to impress me all the time just needs improvement on the audio sound other than that great job I love it
Sucks data harder than. A golf ball through a garden hose
"Sanity. I love listen to music while Im working- keeps me sane. Occasionally though, the music stops a track abruptly and whizzes on to the next which can be a bit frustrating"
Garbage. Connects half the time. Playlists completely greyed out despite data and wifi connection. Stuck on Connecting a lot. Straight up garbage
"Please fix your podcast side. When youre connected to cellular data or wifi it works fine, but when You download an app for offline use and go offline, it rarely works. And when it does work, you have issues with app swapping and the playback resetting. Also, it would be nice if even tho I have cellular data turned on, that if I downloaded the episode it would play the downloaded version rather than stream it on data. Also an auto download feature for podcasts "
"Easy Playlists. Just made really fast and easy playlists using recommended tracks. Along with capability to download, very useful"
Hello. Such a great app and all but I cant download it on my Apple Watch so its not as cool as I thought but it still a good app
Very good. Only bad when I have no data
Chilled out chilly walk. Got and decided to go walking. It was frosty but sunny. I really enjoyed every track on this download. Thank you Spotify. 
"Great app. The app is great I rarely have issues but, about a week ago was having a issue were I had to uninstall/reinstall the app multiple times during the week. The only songs that would play were ones I had downloaded or liked but anything else that was in the shuffle or radio wouldnt work. I dont know what cause the issue but I had to reinstall the app multiple times to get it work and thats on WiFi and mobile data. It seems to be working again without issues but something for the developers to keep on the radar hopefully it was just a bug and its been fixed. Still a great app and really enjoying the new features that they keeping out with"
5 sTaR Vibez. Creative new vibe with a diverse sound best  describes this song along with this whole project Bones Moreland has a different point of view than most STARS who come the real streets...Bonez Music is heart felt and unique with his personal experiences translated with beats and bars
Not opening. I see the creators just made an update 11 hours ago. And this morning when I tried to use the app it refused to open. I tried closing it and re-opening it i tried deleting it and re-downloading it nothing worked.But I do love it
Doesnt work on Apple Watch any longer. Guys Please fix it When I play any track on my phone it doesnt show up on my Apple Watch I cant skip or like track because watch says Your Apple Watch instead of playing the music I just got a new Apple Watch as a Christmas present and reinstalled the app and it does not work
Crashing. Gross app i have used in my whole life keeps on crashing i have iphone 12  and fast wifi and mobile data and still they say maybe its network or maybe your mobile is old or overworked for god sake fix it
"Stops playing after 10 seconds. On mobile only, songs either wont play at all or will only go for 9-11 seconds before stopping. Does not seem to matter if Im connected to wifi, data, have the playlist downloaded, etc. Its been happening for weeks"
Doesnt work on Apple Watch. Downloaded some songs to my Apple Watch gen3 but they refuse to play. Not recommended
Review. Podcasts downloaded struggle to work without WiFi/data connection
"Amazing. I love music I would guess I have close too 1500 CDs, records, and dont laugh cassettes and 8-tracks. I will never stop buying music but this app is so much fun. My wife and I sit on the deck and listen for hours"
"Best. The best experience in music since the development of the personal turntable and vinyl record album. A turned key in a door wide open for the discovery and magic that rewrites and reroutes our journey, in ourselves as well as around us. Let inhibition relax behind that tall glass of refracted dexterity. Simple pleasures come in the form of 5 minute jams, 10 minute masterpieces, and hour long symphonies of harmony. Dive in, get lost, have fun"
Audio Stops. Whenever I hook up my iPad to my Silverado through the USB itll only play the song up to 10 seconds then stop and will not play the next song. I have to kill the app and restart just to play that same song and when it goes to the next track it does the same thing. Its driving me crazy and it really bothers me
"New update sucks. Dont like the new organization. When I look for downloaded podcasts, it should show downloaded episodes, not shows that have downloaded episodes. Also, what the F is with the insane battery usage Just listening to an already downloaded podcast for 3 hours takes over 60% of my battery life When I listen for the same length of time through apple podcasts, its takes 15%. Only thing I can think of is that theyre spying on us"
"Great but when off Wi-Fi bad. Its really good when you are connected to Wi-Fi but when you leave the Wi-Fi range and use cellular data, the music quality goes down. Also not all songs have the lyrics, that annoys me when u want to know the lyrics of a song"
AMAZING. I first used this app in 2018 and loved it ever since. My freind who I told her about the app her and her mum also have the app and love it too I love this app incredible IMany tnx xxx
"Works great until until WatchOS8. The phone app works great, but the watch app has been having issues since watch OS8. My main issue is that the watch no longer displays which songs are playing, and you have zero control, however; oddly enough the volume works just fine? I can control volume meanwhile having zero information of which song is playing. I use my watch to control songs while Im driving and its really annoying not being able to. Writing here as Im not sure how to file a bug report"
Great music. This app is fantastic amazing incredible 
"Buena. Música de buena calidad pero es una app harta de anuncios y solo puedes cambiar 6 canciones por hora, y el premium es muy caro (creo que cuesta 7.99$), pero tiene muchísimas canciones (no todas) de muy buena calidad, la recomiendo mas que Deezer y otras apps de música pero en lo personal siento que deberían de dejar saltar mas canciones y bajarle el precio al premium pero es una muy buena App"
Incredible. This is the best music app I have ever used It is convenient and affordable
"Its good but. It&#39;ll randomly stop in the MIDDLE OF A SONG sometimes. I also hate when it just plays a recommended playlist while im playing my own playlist that has like, 500 songs on it. Its overall pretty good though.edit: I can&#39;t take these &#34;suggested tracks&#34; anymore. They come up at least 5 times a day, and they aren&#39;t even songs I would like "
"Evolution. Isnt it great  No more records, no more 8 tracks, cassettes, Cds, Discs  Just your favorites at your finger tips . Thank you "
Excellent App. An incredible Music App.Has anything you could wish to listen to.Has a Library of music second to none.Top Notch
Really good but uses so much battery and data. This is so good and useful when stressed although if your phone doesnt have a lot of data I dont recommend to get a battery and data wasting app. Although overall 4 stars
More information please. Id love to see more information on the artist/band Also the links to their Wikipedia page is useful
Cumple bien ... En lo personal si cumple con mis necesidades
"Wont download podcasts. Lately, Ill download a podcast successfully. Ill drive to work or wherever, a shorter time than the episode length, then the next time I go to continue listening to the episode, the download is gone and the episode is marked played. Therefore, it is not saving my spot in the episode AND making me now listen using data. PLEASE FIX"
"Error on JOE ROGAN PODCAST. the time indicator gets stuck, stops moving forward.  So if I stop playing the podcast and come back to it later, it gives an error message and goes back to a much earlier part of the podcast.  The stupid app cant keep track of how much of an episode has been played"
"Finally finally. Omg thank you for finally finally finally working with my echo dots for multi room music, omg thank u  Can you please make it so my my personal music library is accessible in a really great way?  I miss my library"
"Good, but not perfect. Very good mostly, but not perfect. It would be a lot better if the app didnt crash whilst listening to it when on a walk, and I have to keep re-downloading all the albums I choose to download. I have to re-click download on many albums, and you have to stay on the app for it to work. Its really annoying to do, especially seeing as this happens several times a month. If I didnt have these problems, I would give the app 5 stars easily. Its still however a very useful app for me as a musician, as well as very enjoyable on a personal basis"
Vera Lyn. Its such a comfort to have access to all her incredible sentimental music that reminds me of my childhood listening to her with my parents now that they are no longer with me after their passing.
Amazing. You can find your favorite songs in both explicit and clean. Makes it easy for personal and party playlists
It wont open. It opens without any connection WiFi or data and asks me to sign in but I cant sign in without data or WiFi and when I turn the WiFi or data on it closes the app
Uses cell data. Use cell data despite having turned it off finally had to uninstall and reinstall. Hopefully this solves the problem
"Late getting here but. Spotty has been my inspiration for the spinning classes Ive been teaching the past three years. Such a great, easy to use app. One minor gripe is on the odd occasion theyve removed a favourite track and I wish Id been notified as I spent so much time trying to find it"
Glitch?. When a list is playing it used to highlight what track was playing. Last update seems to have removed that
Apple Watch. Doesnt connect to Apple Watch via cellular data. Very frustrating
"I thought swedes made good products. Dude fix this app I cant listen to JRE since he moved to this platform. VPN doesnt work, cell data doesnt work only if Im on a really secure WiFi even then its pretty garbage. And your desktop app is complete trash takes up way to much star and memory and it barely works"
"Why is there no widget for this?. I want there to be a widget for this cause its super nice to be able to skip and play tracks from the home screen without having to swipe down from the top. Also, I know the group session is in beta still, but to compensate for the delay when you play/pause a track it skips the other devices track a couple seconds forward. The gap it skips is too much. So after you play it on one device the other device(s) will be a second or two ahead. Other than that everything is pretty great, I like the UI and I havent really come across any other bugs"
Just not great at all. Outdated interface.  Poor recommendations. Bad value.  Eats data unnecessarily
Dont update. Just did the latest update and now it will not load wether Im on WiFi or data and says Im offline when Im not Very fustrating
"UPDATE NOW. This is my 11th time installing/uninstalling this app. My songs jeep stopping at 10 seconds. And when u swipe to next, it freezes and shuts down. My data is supreme and my wifi is godly so its definitely an app issue. Please fix now"
"I normally love the app but. Strange things have been happening. Any given track will stop playing at exact 6 seconds and 4 times out of 10, a track will randomly stop a minute before its finished then skip to the next one. Its been a couple weeks now and I assumed it would fix itself, but it just didnt"
"Audio cuts out one too many times. Its really frustrating to be listening to music and then the audio cuts out. Ive tried going offline, using data, changing wifi settings and using it without Bluetooth and to no avail. I got Premium a while ago, expecting no interruptions in my music listening, but then I get these cut outs. Not fun, not impressed. Please fix this"
Good but still have sth to improve. Good app but I cant download it on my Apple Watch
Absolutely Incredible. I love this app. I can play all my favorite songs without having to pay. I love it and love listening to all my favorite songs in fact I listening to music right now. 
Crashes. App keeps crashing during songs on most recent update. Getting very irritating having to open up the app every time and restart tracks
"Great, but. It has everything, and easy to use. My wish for the future is to have it provide information about the artists and the albums"
"app crashing. Only recently has my app been crashing during random songs and killing my iphone battery, tried turning off anything that would drain it that fast, dont use data, I have no idea whats going on but this is super frustrating since Ive been using this for years and never had this issue. Tried deleting the app and downloading it again and that doesnt work. Please fix this horrible update that seems to be ruining phones"
Allow me to listen to audio only podcasts without going offline. Since the jre podcasts moved over I hate that I can&#39;t just download the audio only version of the podcast and listen to it. Even when I select that option it still plays the video version when I&#39;m online. It wastes my data. Please change this so I don&#39;t have to go offline every time I wanna listen to JRE
App constantly crashing. After deleting and downloading. No update available. Paying for an app that isnt accessible on my phone
"As long as Joe Rogan is here, Ill be too. Its great to have access to a guy who actually asks great questions, who is curious, and pushes back against the NARRATIVE. I dont always agree with him or understand his point of view. However, I enjoy the open, thoughtful conversations and his fearlessness to be controversial while seeking the deeper truths that the data invites"
I want to see video on audio downloaded podcasts at home. I have downloaded podcasts to audio only to save data. But when Im at home I want to be able to watch the same podcast with the video.Is this possible to do without deleting the download? Or am I just missing something
"Hold up. Running on an iPhone 6S, iOS ver 14.2 here. Is it just me, or is this app crashing every, like, 12 seconds? It\'s getting to the point where it\'s genuinely frustrating and I can\'t get through a single song without it happening. I\'ve tried disconnecting bluetooth, checking for updates in the App Store, resetting my device - nothing. I love being able to listen to my favorite Metallica albums but I\'m a little tired of listening to the first 7 seconds of \Back in Black\ just for it to stop abruptly and crash completely. Thankfully, it\'s the only problem I\'ve come across. Everything else (including the minimal data consumption) is definitely top-tier"
My discord is AnimexLife 3627. Also this is the most greatest apps out there There none other than this perfect app well I mostly listen to songs at night when Im sleeping well thanks for having this incredible app
"thanks. yall really made me a personal playlist that made me feel special, thank you"
"Was good up until 2 weeks ago. Barely works, if I have WiFi or mobile data on, the song will work for a minute then refreshes and starts the song again"
Latest version causes music or podcasts to stop. Title says it all. Plays a track or a podcast for about a minute and then stops. When you restart it begins at the start of the track and the podcast and keeps happening
"Crash. App consistently has been crashing and after download repeatedly, restarts, fully clearing data, I am unable to use the app as it crashes of minute or so"
Constantly shuts down. I can listen for 20 minutes then it shuts off and if I get back in I cant even finish a song without it shutting off again. WiFi cell data nothing makes a difference. Ive deleted reinstalled and same thing every time. Fix it
Feedback. Good music But some tracks cant find originalWhite wedding billy idol 7 inch Caren wheeler living in the light Are 2 not available on this service
Get ride of all conspiry theorists. Get rid of Joe Rogan and any other spewing false information
Stops playing certain songs. Sooo annoying Some of my fav reggae tracks stop playing after 15secs? Cant get them to play regardless of what I try. Only seems to be with old rocksteady reggae.. Babylon strong? Jah bless this mess~
"Thank you to the software engineers and the designers. Title says it all. App is incredible, and it gets better all the time"
Still doesnt work. The app opens now and works fine on data but when Im on wifi it says I am offline and doesnt work
Life on track. Good monster robot jobGreat humans play
Great app... but. Great app. Please keep adding more albums.  Have great collections. But the latest updates often make the app crash and worse than older version. Today it crashed twice when I was listening to certain tracks
"Just incredible. Its an amazing music app , any song that you want , definitely recommend"
Watch app is broken. The watch app will not load even while I am on Wi-Fi. Sometimes I can get it to load if I completely reset my watch but that has only worked once in the last 5 days. I have also deleted and redownloaded the app so many times that Ive lost track of how many its been. As a premium member I expected everything to work as it does with every other device I use with Spotify but the support for this app seems very lacking. Would be 5 stars if the watch app worked
"Speed adjustment. Nice app, as always Im a jazz musician who sometimes need to slow down the track for the purpose of transcribing music. Is there any way you can add a speed-adjusting bar on your app? Thank you"
"New update sucks. Who decided this update would be better than the easy three tabs they had before? The update sucks and I cant go directly to my downloaded podcast episodes without having the page load all episodes first (which needs data or wifi, neither of which I have at work). Please revert it to the previous version, Im ready to switch to Apple Music"
This is the best music player. My personal favorite is Rustage
"Credits. Album credits would be great. Engineers, producers, players. So much data available these days"
previews. song previews and tracks are no longer showing up. dont know if it only affects people who are using the free version (like myself) but its annoying because i cant even tell if ill like the song or not
"Whats Going On. Podcasts wont play on web player or desktop app, they just freeze and wont play. But I can play the podcast on my phone and it works fine. Tried everything like reinstalling and clearing data but it doesnt work Very annoying for office folk who need the desktop app and cant have their phone playing"
The app vanished from my watch face. Suddenly the app from my watch just vanished and it wont show up even if I delete the app and download it again. Is it my watchs problem or something wrong with the app?
"Update causing crashes, unusable. Ever since I updated to the latest version,it stops  playing after 5-30 seconds, doesnt matter if its a new track or one that Ive downloaded"
Force shutdowns. I am using IOS 13.3 (17C54) on an IPhone SE(2016) and forces Shutdowns every five minutes. I am not sure if I need to delete data or update my software. How much free space  I should have?
"Speed of Now Part 1 Keith Urban. This album is genius Absolutely incredible genre-free music fluidity Keith Urban knocks it Out-The-Cage with this fun, self-reflective collaboration with Pink, Breland, Eric Church and more This record will make you dance, clap, sing and cry Get it now"
Stops playing certain songs. Sooo annoying Some of my fav reggae tracks stop playing after 9-15secs? Cant get them to play regardless of what I try. Only seems to be with old rocksteady reggae.. Babylon strong? Jah bless this mess~
Cannot download to my Apple Watch. Fully updated the app on my new watch series 7 and cant download to it as the downloads doesnt load on the app on Watch
"Great app. Excellent. Had it for awhile now as a free version and I like using it. Thousands of tracks, never hear the same tune. Easy layout, Not clunky at all. Im going to pay monthly if I get a good offer sent to me"
"Incredible, show-stopping, spectacular. Best music app ever"
Crashing. The app is only working on mobile data. Crashing when connected to WiFi
Timu Time Podcast #13 Depression and Suicide: Our Story. A sensitive subject that was addressed in a personal but powerful way 
"App crashes when connected to wifi. When connected to WiFi, the app crashes while it works normally when you open it only with mobile data"
"Sucks for podcasts. Was a Rogan listener, have pretty much given up on it, downloading the episode never works so I waste huge amount is data steaming video while its in my pocket  Give us a damn option to have audio only and get the downloading to work"
"Ok but not that good. Poor in car connection with both BMW and Volvo, tried on two different phones, tracks stick and wont allow to move forward or just dont play altogether.  Certainly not worth the premium service Im paying for"
"Crashing. Decent app, but my friends and I experience a ton of crashing. We all have premium and weve uninstalled, reinstalled the app, looked for updates and cleared cache and allowed background data to be on and off for it. Fix the bugs please. We know its not our phones"
maybe in love. Great app if u have a lot of Wi-fi/data and patience. Wide variety of music and interesting daily mixes but sometimes there are far toooo many adds Ive had up to 9 in a row. 
Its pretty good. It would be a five star if Didnt have so many ads and also not having Suggested tracks
"Incredible app, very few adds. I love this app. It works incredible with wireless headphones/earbuds. Its the best. I suggest this app to anyone who wants to listen to music. Incredible app. Love it. One hundred percent love it. Suggest to anyone"
Hands down best I have found. As a former DJ this has to be in my top 2 go to for personal music. The easy interface to the available selection of music brings this to the front. I have tried several times to trump the library with obscure songs. But to my amazement only 2x over a couple years has it not been available. So if you are like myself and enjoy a wide variety of music. This is a cant miss choice
Force shutdowns. I am using IOS 13.3 (17C54) on an IPhone SE(2016) and forces Shutdowns every five minutes. I am not sure if I need to delete data or update my software. How much free space should have?
"Unable to access the menu to repeat or shuffle tracks using VoiceOver on iPad Pro 3rd gen. As the title of the review says, I&#39;m unable to access the menu to repeat or shuffle tracks on an iPad pro 11 inch third generation (2021).I can access it just fine on my iPhone 12 pro max, I&#39;m not sure what the issue is. If I try to open the menu by double-tapping on the title or artist, it brings me to the album or artist page. There seems to be no way to access the menu using VoiceOver.I&#39;m running iPadOS 14.7.1"
"Bug?. App is great. However, the app is currently up to date on my phone and will not open up. I deleted it and the downloaded it again, and its still refusing to open up"
Cant use WLAN and data on iPhone. Bug exists
"Unable to unhide song and unable to go forward few songs. Unable to unhide songs, even using the option Hide unplayable tracks off.Basic features go forward  few seconds is not working"
"The new update keeps shutting the app down. The new update keeps shutting the app down everytime if youre connected via WiFi or mobile data, it works fine in airplane mode. Fix please"
"Podcast Playback is Atrocious. Podcasts interface needs to be simplified. My phone keeps forgetting where I am in a podcast even if I pause and come back 5 mins later. I cant manually turn off the videos so it kills my battery and data, and every time my GPS says something it pauses the podcast and wont restart automatically. basic functionality is all I ask"

"Cant watch rogan on roku tv app. Couldnt get it to play videos at first. Came back from time to time but no dice. Also, podcasts dont support video so I cant watch Rogan on my smart tv. Thats a deal breaker. I refuse to work that hard to watch Rogan"
Amazing. This app is just incredible
Amazing app. This is incredible I dont even know how to describe it with words. I can listen to disco and tik tok music with a push of a button. I think Im going to have a good day today but Im not gonna be able to get a hold of her tomorrow or Friday I have to do this for a little bit so she will have a good time at work and then you can be there at six or so I will let you know when Im going running and I have a little more time for you tomorrow ok baby?  love you Sweetheart
"Brutal. Brutal, havent been able to listen to one podcast without it pausing to load every minute or so, doesnt matter if on data or wifi, YouTube and Netflix works all the time so I dont understand, are you going to figure it out you mutants?"
"OUTSTANDING SOUND QUALITY. I use this app with my Marantz SR8012, 5 Bose Acoustimass Cubes and 1 Klipsch subwoofer and it combined SOUNDS OUTSTANDING. Now, only downside is the navigation, its not as great and easy to use and find new tracks and albums as Tidal or Amazon Music. But, again, if sound quality matters to you, get this one"
Not compatible with Apple Watch. I have a morning playlist and Ill play it from my Apple Watch.. the first song will and then it refuses to play the next 2. Everytime I try to play either of those 2 songs it will skip it or it will play with no sound
"Unable to View Artist Pages. Blank Black Page, Latest version of iOS, iPhone XS Max, internet working fine, wont work on data either, I hope this helps, respond to review once patched and review will be re submitted"
"Pretty great in every way. However. My only complaint is a small one: there is no option to disable the audio tones that come from pausing or skipping tracks with the buttons on earbuds/headphones. I tend to have my music up pretty loud, and those audio tones actually hurt my ears at those times. I feel like I shouldnt have to modulate my volume to account for this. I know why such a feature exists and I understand it, but I DO NOT understand why theres no option to turn it off"
Incredible heaven. This app is the best thing that has ever happened to me. You can even play games while listening to your favourite jams
New update buggy?. Wont even load anything just has 3 big dots and times out. I have premium and tried on WiFi and just my data
"Podcast Interface is over engineered and underperforms. Podcasts interface needs to be simplified. My phone keeps forgetting where I am in a podcast even if I pause and come back 5 mins later. I cant manually turn off the videos so it kills my battery and data, and every time my GPS says something it pauses the podcast and wont restart automatically.basic functionality is all I ask"
"Great for music, needs work on podcasts. Podcasts regularly wont play when Ive got the episode downloaded, and podcasts with video (like JRE) are a nightmare that needs to be fixed (sucking data when only listening to audio, again not playing when downloaded, etc.)"
Best app ever . This app is incredible
"Incredible. The app speaks for itself, it is phenomenal. I just cannot believe Ive spent so many years without downloading this app. It is absolutely amazing"
Bluetooth just doesnt work. I have an IPhone 12 so I know its not my phone but for some reason I will be playing music and I try to connect it to my ION Pathfinder 3 speaker and it will just stop playing all together. Almost like it chooses which songs work and which dont and its not my service cuz all songs trying to be played are downloaded. Its just all around frustrating. Thats why I give 4 out of 5 stars. Its my personal go to for music just has little kinks that make it not perfect
Tha baddiest female rapper in the game. Dame ya sound good on the track and ur music is lit
Best Yet. It is an incredible App. I love it
Amazing. Incredible love it my favorite app
Incredible app. Best music app ever
Incredible App. Has great info about artists. Love how it also has lots of minor artists I love such as the Maes  very easy to use
Music keeps skipping tracks. My music has been skipping multiple tracks even my downloaded library in offline mode. Please fix this
"Not military life friendly. Great platform, incredible music selection and the price cant be beat right up to that 30 day mark. Deployments get a little tougher and awhile lot grouchier once the music disappears"
"Good. Great apart from some crashes , and pleaaaaassseeee i ran out of data and listened to my downloaded songs...only about 2/10 songs played"
App crashes frequently. Ever since I updated the app it crashes very often while playing songs. I dont know whats causing it. Ive tried using it without any other apps open but it still crashes. Ive tried using it only on WiFi or only on my data and it still crashes
"Broken. Mainly use on my Xbox, however recently I was logged out. When trying to log back in I noticed when hit log in after putting my information in just doesnt do anything, no incorrect login or anything so I login through the website to make sure I have my info right and I do. So I try one more time and to my surprise nothing happens. So I try the app and the worst part of all is that the app just wont load up for me"
Audio quality. Room for improvement. Tracks sound lifeless with less jump Than the exact Cd counterpart. Access to such a large library is nice but dissatisfied with audio quality
"Crashing. For some reason everytime I open the app it crashes. Ive done everything to fix it, Ive restarted my phone, deleted and re installed the app, re started all my settings, cleared my data, but it wont work and Im not sure why. This is really disappointing, how am I supposed to use what I paid for??"

"Doesnt work anymore. Use this app almost daily and today it refuses to open Ive tried everything. Updating the app, turning phone off and on, reinstalling app, nothing works"
"Divine Playlists. Thanks for curating incredible playlists for me, based I assume, on the artists I listen to, and related ones. Loving them. "
"Keeps Crashing. Whether Im on the road, at work, or at home, the app will randomly crash. I thought at first it was because I was using data as opposed to WiFi, but it crashes without warning no matter what Im using"
House music. Love it so easy to use and find new tracks
Feedback. amazing songs but i hate the adds please get rid of them  thank youuuu
Its keeps stopping in the middle of the track. Fix the glitch where it stops right in the middle of my track for no good reason
"JRE. Fantastic as always, just wish the option to listen without the video was there. Dont need to burn extra data on something Im not watching"
"Logged me out. It randomly Logged me Out And I Cant log back inIm editing this...This Was with My old Email, I dont have access to it anymore and My recent one Doesnt work.So Can you fix the glitch,This happened on my phone and IPad,Thanks~"
Horrible algorithm. They gave me my top artist list and it is so far from accurate. You have my data. Do better
"lil wifi bug. unfortunately i tried to open the app various time while connected to wi-fi connection and the app automatically crashes right after opened, then if i try with data connection it works regularly"
"Doesn't work when I use wifi. whenever i try to use it on wifi it crashes.When i use data it works fine, but it&#39;s kinda annoying"
"Continuously crashing. Recently about a week ago the app start to crash quite a lot in an interval, sometimes lock the screen stopped the app from working. Other times, the app stop working if the setting page where the cellular data connect to the app isnt open with the app itself"
Unstable. Generally this app is brilliant. I can play enough music in the morning to wake me up and set me off for the day. But Why does it continually stop. Restart the app and it does pickup from the position of the last track which is good. But I have found that this happens on all three of my Apple devices and occasionally my LG telly. Mostly on iOS. Its a real shame as otherwise this would be 5 stars
Danny N. Deep cuts of music paired together to ones personal taste. 
"Too slow. This app for whatever reason is beyond slow, even if I download an episode of a podcast it still wont play, itll load and load but never play, I will be listening to my podcasts elsewhere since this app need too much data or perfect WiFi in order to be able to playback anything I want to listen, I do no have this problem on YouTube or iTunes or anywhere else except for this app"
Dolby atmos. If Dolby atmos was added this app would be instant 5 star even if atmos is only with premium still that would be incredible
Nothing else is worthy of being bothered with. Awesome track ... :lyrical peak
Not intuitive. Cannot move through tracks really frustrating and not easy to use
Young Dumb Blond Opinion. Charlie speaks his mind but keeps his core beliefs upfront and open for all to hear. You may agree or disagree with his statements but I truly appreciate him and his podcast for keeping American values. He interviews those that have real life experience and wisdom to give others. As a young adult I have gleaned so much information to take into consideration as I am building my own personal beliefs and core values. If you are done hearing the crap the world tells you and want to hear a challenge filled with hope for our country listen to this podcast and research the people Charlie interviews and what they have to say as well
Must get. InsaneAbsolutely incredible App
Hey. This is wierd but its a way to get through the noise and void. How do you get all this information so fast? I want to hug and kiss you. If we went on a date i would try to pay for all of it then shyly try to dial back to dutch. Make a lame joke and pun. Talk about time being weird. Try comfortable silence or overtalk my awkward boner off. Reference a diner scene
Incredible app. Amazing stuff
"Incredible. Are you guys gods? Because THIS APP IS, LIKE, LITERALLY MADE FROM GODS Its so good Thank you for this app. Love ya"
"3x speed is inaudible. 2x is buttery. My guess is that 3x is removing data, rather than compressing. Please fix"
"Glitch please fix this. I dont know why but for some reason I cant click on the main popular songs list option at the top of each artists page anymore, I click it repeatedly and it wont open up to show the songs, I tried turning my phone off and on, I tried switching between data and WiFi, I tried deleting and redownloading the app and nothing is work, this is very frustrating as someone trying to look through new artists music but not knowing where to start so wanting to preview the popular songs first"
"crashing, slow to connect. in recent months the app has been crashing and burning my battery in the bg and causing my phone to become really hot a LOT. also, it doesn&#39;t recognize when there is connection (data and wifi) and needs to be restarted before it will load songs"
Recent change. This app is obviously amazing. But the app has been crashing over and over again. Saying something went wrong  every time I open the app. My phone is up to date. I have a new iPhone. The issue is that the app will crash two or three times before a song finishes. At that point I just close it and pull up YouTube. This is a new problem its been happening for about three days. Doesnt matter if Im on wifi or data. May be because of the recent update. Worth looking into
Amazing but not secure. I keep getting hacked. Somewhere in Europe they keep accessing my account. Its happened 5 times already and I keep changing my password. Not happy
"Cool. The app is awesome. The only two reasons I gave it four stars is one, they cut out the skits on a lot of classic albums, those of us from the CD-Rom era enjoy/miss those. And two, theres no mixtapes available on here which normally is understandable, however artists like Lil Wayne and the Diplomats have an incredible body of work that was released on mixtapes. Not to mention the Ron G mixtapes from the 90s where a lot of legendary artists got their starts. Other than those things though the app is great"
Wonderful. Its the my own personal favorite place to hear  music
I have been hacked and can not get rid of hacker. Ok
Nice. Lots of access to helpful info and lovely music
"Horrible code. Ill be listening to joes podcast and all the sudden it says playback failed, so then I have to quit the app and open it back up and find where I left off because it starts it all over. I download the podcasts too so I dont eat up my data, but when it says playback failed and I restart the app, its no longer downloaded Also, often when Im listening to the downloaded podcast it will start buffering Todays episode of this horrible app though 7 times it just all the sudden reverts back to the first 8 minutes of the podcast, so I have to find where I was again. 7 times"
"Crashing Issue. Normally Id give this app 4-5 stars as Ive been using it for nearly 6 years now with little issue. However, the app has been crashing often recently in the middle of playing one song, around a minute into the track. Please fix this soon"
I downloaded podcasts to listen to offline and its not working. I downloaded a bunch of podcasts to listen to when Im out running errands or the like and to find the podcasts that I downloaded I have to either turn on data and connect to wifi. While all the music I saved is there. I cant access any of my downloaded episodes? It just says youre not connected to the internet but the whole point of downloading it is so I dont have to. Sometimes the your episodes tab disappeared completely
"Incredible. Best music app out there, period"
Crashes. App keeps crashing on a semi-regular basis. Seems to crash every time I turn on data when Im outside with no wifi
"Keeps crashing. After the recent update, app crashes when connected to WiFi but on cellular data it works perfectly fine"
incredible. the BEST music app ever
Bury Me Alive. Incredible Each track is better the next
"Great app usually but new update sucks. Just updated to the latest software and now it crashes constantly, and plays the same songs multiple times in a row. Skipping backwards either doesnt work or the app will crash. Skipping ahead through the multiple tracks queued also causes the app to crash. Not impressed"
"Great but. Overall the app is incredible but there is one issue that needs to be resolved. Im not sure if this is a problem with apple or the app but occasionally the app will open and then immediately crash and theres no known way to fix it, you just have to wait until it works again. This has been a bug for way too long and many people are experiencing this. It also may be because of maintenance on the app from developers and if thats the case, a heads up that there is scheduled maintenance would be appreciated"
Poor quality for data or wifi use. My wired and Bluetooth wireless connections sound like someone randomly keeps slowing down and speeding up the track. Everything is fully updated and I have the iPhone 12. Bug fix maybe?
Overnight update and now it wont load. Love this app. Party tonight at mine but now I cant load the app. Just crashes. Reinstalled a few times. Restarted phone etc. Reset data (which is annoying) still nothing
Comunicación más personal con ustedes. Dejen de poner anuncios en la aplicación se supone que uno les paga un servicio para evitar anuncios y cosas así y tener sólo el servicio de música .... y también sería grandioso tener ustedes un número para llamarles y así poner ciertas inconformidades del servicio o para realizar pagos si cambios del mismo
"Great app for listening. Worth the $5 a month as a student Great deal. Really wish Cramers Mad Money came out the day of (its uploaded a day after the live report). Other than that, the user interface could be improved to better utilize personal assessment when providing new songs to listen to. Other than that, all my favorite music/podcasts are on here Worth the $5 membership for a student"
Insightful. Thank you Monica and Kristen for an awesome on going conversation and information
Decent. Decent but the suggested tracks are never good and they are just in the app so you have to waste all your skips and you just leave the app
"Incredible, amazing, show-stopping, never been done before. My everyday app. I love the design and its a great creative outlet for me"
Drains battery fast. New iPhone SE. cellular data off. Two hours took over 85% of battery
"Major app issues. Search engine doesnt work, anything entered is not recognised couldnt find....App constantly closes down and most of the time wont even open. App and phone are both updated and tried resetting phone multiple times. This issue happens on other devices at home, and whether or not using wifi or data. Paying for a service that doesnt work as advertised"
"Human emotion Nuclear Heart. A moving, fresh and lovely track"
Great listening. I am so new to this and I am hooked. Love the suggested tracks from a single song entered. I have a great playlist for just about all the music I enjoy ;which is pretty extensive
cant explain how good it is. no literally its so good for all day and moods like when I just want to cry to drivers license or I want to feel old i listen to one direction THOSE 18 MONTHS HAS BEEN LONG or I just want to listen to the best music like any billie eilish or pop smoke or the weekend or sza or when I just want to feel that I am in love I listen to a star is born track songs you get what I mean anyways GET IT
New update crashes. I normally love this app and honestly Im only writing this here due to not being label to report the bug I think the app has. Since the latest update whenever Im on WiFi the app keeps crashing - like oClick it and it then comes out/crashes within seconds. Works fine with 3G but Id like to use it without using up all my data I have reset my phone multiple times and still the same issue. I hope you can fix this soon
Problems with long podcasts. Skipping forward and backwards in a long podcast results in wrong time stamps. It simply loses my place. It doesnt even track the time after some point. Its frustrating not to be able to skip reliably to a time
"Big Fan. Luis has the most soothing voice, which is incredible to listen to for a disregulated nervous system. This Podcast gives me so much information about how to navigate life to better manage, hear, and heal my nervous system and traumas.I most recommend Episode 56, How sugar affects the body"
App crashes every minute or so even when on WiFi. I thought it might have been that I ran out of data but I use LTE and even when on good WiFi it crashes every minute. Sometimes it gets so bad that it will play for 10 seconds and crash. Used to never have this problem but its been getting worse and worse as time goes on
Slow. Im here for joe Rogan the app is slow. Currently stuck in an ad loop. Takes forever to load episodes poor video quality and you cant upgrade with in app. These guys are lucky they have joe or ide be out. Only way I get this app to work is by shutting off WiFi and mobile data then back on iPad 2020 and iPhone XR
Apple Watch?. Apple Watch app still isnt working correctly with the new update
"Buggy as F***k. Since JRE came over I start listen to the podcast here. OMG soo much bugs, you download a episode with take forever to download then, to listen to that same episode you have to turn on your data when you are offline to listen to the episode you just downloaded. It randomly stops playing your episode and sometimes marks it as played, so you have to replay and scroll back to where you were. It also forgets where you left of the last time you were listening"
Good. I listen to music a lot so I really like the variety. There have been a few crashes and tracks skip 10 seconds in once in a while but a reset of my phone fixes it usually
Crime in sports. Incredible entertaining and very addictive hilarious
Perfect. Amazing no memberships needed all music and your personal playlist and right now Im listening to Ballin with Roddy Rich
"Good but crashes. Why does this app crash so often. I got an iPhone 11 on the newest version of iOS, and I dont run very many background apps and have a WiFi connection backed up with data that can watch 4K video and stream games. I dont really see a reason for it to crash so often? Other than that its great"
"Crashes as of recent version. Crashes everytime you open it on iOS 13.5.1, tried clearing data, fresh install, restart. Will change review when it is fixed"
Magnifico. Para mi en lo personal es la mejor aplicación de música que se puede tener. Continuamente traen más variedad y nuevos temas y audios que antes no se podían escuchar. Los felicito
"Consistently Shuts Down While Running. not sure if this is a connection issue or an operating system error, but have had multiple times where running the app on an iPhone, that the app just force closes itself. very frustrating while youre listening to a good song and then just stops. Not sure if this is a user error and personal device thing, or if other users on other platforms have had similar experience. Just would like a fix if there is one. #askingforafriend "
"Nice sound quality. The quality of the sound is really good. Also, its very practical to listen to podcasts. Great for personal development"
Great conversation. Been watching these guys react to music since I decided came out. Now that I can hear them on their own podcast while working is really nice. They have good personalities that remind you of having a conversation with ur own siblings. 10/10
podcast wont work offline. even when downloaded Podcasts will not loadWithout Wi-Fi or data
Happy Camper. Just an absolute pleasure to play my diverse music loves over the day on my personal playlist Thanks Guys
"Keeps crashing and refuses to reopen. This app keep closing the moment I open it I have tried restarting phone, deleting and reinstalling app, clearing cache, and every other solution provided. I will be cancelling my premium subscription as there is no point of paying for something that wont openP.s. Im using a iPhone 11 with the latest software update"
Too many emails. Multiple emails regarding password hack is spam I receive 5 a day. Stop would like to op out of receiving these  but not an option
"Good but crashes. Why does this app crash so often. I got an iPhone 11 on the newest version of iOS, and I dont run very many background apps and have a WiFi connection backed up with data that can watch 4K video and stream games. I dont really see a reason for it to crash so often? Other than that its great. Its just REALLY irritating. Thanks"
"Awesome but too many crashes. I love everything about this app and service except when, for whatever reasons, the app continuously crashes. If I use airplane mode the app will load, but as soon as I connect to any network, it crashes. Cycling cell power doesnt work. The only fix is to delete the app and reinstall it, and download all your playlists again. Uses a good chunk of my monthly data, and pisses me off every time"
Disappointed. Bad choice of music combinations. Look for Bach partitas for violin and you get a lot of stuff not event remotell6 connected to those prices. But hey it is all about selling &#39;en masse&#39;. Disapointed so far
INCREDIBLE. Favourite app - most used app. Amen
"How this podcast impacted me. This podcast is incredible Ive listened to nearly every episode, and I can honestly say, its been nothing short of incredible for me. Allie is so personal and authentic with her stories, interviews, and raw insight. She is a treasure of a podcaster"
Pretty great app but. This is a pretty great app straight forward and there is nothing wrong with the app except one thing. Now take this review with a grain of salt since I dont believe its the app whats wrong but on my side of it. So basically it works out great. But the downside is that it only works when Im connected to the WiFi. When Im off its always stuck on connecting. I could wait for 5-10 minutes and its stuck on connecting. I turned on the cellular data for this app and I tried logging on and off. AND its on he current update of the app. That is the only problem I have with the app and sorry this isnt a review per se but yk. Asking for a friend
Brilliant. Very good for listen at work But used to much data sometimesOverall very good
"Disappointed. I worshipped this app originally, but now it is pure dread. I cant even open the app unless my iPhone is in airplane mode, if not I open it and it force shuts everytime. I am a loyal recurring premiums customer, so please any help would be appreciated.Note, Ive reinstalled the app several times now, I have cleared app data and history, cleared cookies. I still cannot get onto the app"
Options. Need to be able to download on Apple Watch. It would be huge plus for working out
"Crashes every time opening it. Keeps crashing when WiFi and mobile data are switched on, have to have airplane mode on all the time for it to actually work"
"v nice. v good, quirky way to express my pain hehe love that i can add my own personal pic and description to playlist covers really adds spice yk"
"App isnt working. I updated my phone to IOS 13. 5. 1, deleted the app, downloaded it AND restarted my phone multiple times and it still isnt working. I even attempted downloading it on another apple device and it has the same issue. Super frustrating that its clashing, Please fix this error ASAP"
"Refusing To Open. App worked great for months, but now is refusing to open no matter what I do Ive tried everything. Deleting and re-downloading it, restarting my phone, closing the app completely, but nothing is working"
enke. Very good app but tracks are not in hi resolution

"Siri search on Apple Watch. Hello,The Siri search on my Apple Watch stopped working for a few weeks now.If I try searching something I got this message on the watch: You will need an app for me to help with that. Try searching in the Apple Watch app on yout phone.I tried to reinstall the app on the watch, but it did not help. It was a very useful feature during running. Can you look into this?Thanks"
"App keeps crashing mid song. Every time I load in the app, play a song for 20 seconds tops, and then the entire app crashes. I have logged out and logged back in, done a clean reinstall, etc, but nothing seems to work. Ive even tried other devices, but the same problem happens. It doesnt even seem to matter about the internet connection, as both wifi and cellular data allows it to crash. Today alone (12-14-20) it has crashed 4 times in the past 3 minutes. The app is up to date, I have storage on my phone, and I see no reason it would be doing this.Update: today (12-15-20) this same thing has happened another 4-5 times. Google still has no help with this glitch, and I may just delete the app if it isnt fixed (I just want to listen to some music.)"

"App Crashes. I cant access the app at all when it is connected to the WiFi. I open it, and it instantly closes right after. Ive tried reinstalling it, i cant even log in, doesnt work when I use my mobile data either. Literally frustrating"
"Keeps crashing. The app has done welll for me but today it always crashing half a second after I open it, Ive reinstalled, restarted the iPhone, used my data but none of it works. Is there anyway you can fix this?"

JRE is great. I downloaded to watch Joe Rogan and see what the fuss was about. The stories are great and informative. No misinformation just conversation
Bad. All of the tracks stops second 10 
"Not working. My app was working and now its opening then closing for no reason tried 10 reinstalls, factory reset and reset cache data. Please fix iphone 10"
Great... tho. Stop giving me so many suggested tracks
"Genial. Lo que más me gusta es eso de que te muestran música para uno , personal y después te hacen un resumen de tu año , gracias"
Really good but still cant find some tracks/ musicians. Dont get me wrong this is great and I love the scope and access to new music. Works well with Sonos. My only gripe is that without trying hard there are some major absences
"Constantly crashing. Been an amazing app to date.  Auto update 2 days ago, now it wont even open. Crashes every time I open it. Have deleted the app (and all downloaded data (premium version)), re installed, same - keeps crashing. Using iOS and no recent updates - be aware"
iPad Button Spacing too Much. The spacing on the skip forward and skip back track are too far apart and are awkward and difficult to use. Place them closer together similar to iPhone
Keeps Crashing. never had this problem before but it keeps crashing. I even updated it and made sure im connected to wifi or had good cellular data. its really annoying and this needs to be fixed
Just wanted to say. The cross-fade between tracks is executed pretty well
Harrys. I refused to be taken by the other brand when I discovered Harrys blades.  I was sold on Harrys. Davey B
"App keeps crashing before and after update/on WiFi. Just woke up, on my way to work. Open app, and it force closes. I checked for updates. There was an update available as of this morning. I updated, now the app wont even open. Uninstalled, restarted phone, still crashes. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Please fix ASAP. I pay $16+ dollars a month for your app, and use it all day everyday at work and home. Love your library, just expect it to work without a hitch for the price tag Ill change my rating once this is fixed. Happens on WiFi connection but not data. Its not my internet because it happens both at home and work"
Incredible. Always has the music Im looking for
"Enjoyable. I so appreciate the daily mix, thank you for your personal touch"
Great but. I love it Ive used it load recently but when I dont know how to do something at the begging theirs no tutorial or easy guide on how to other than that its incredible

"Really enjoyed this one. Always interesting to listen to Garys podcasts and interviews. Personal, informative and to the point. With humour and life experiences thrown in for free.Great insight into the manufacturing and product launch of the Harrier UK brand and Kates journey to get there. Looking forward to following her progress"
Crashes on opening since update. DO NOT UPDATE. I just updated to the version that came out today (10 July) and it wont open and just flashes up then immediately crashes every single time. It only opens when in aeroplane mode but the moment you turn data or WiFi back in it crashes. Please fix this ASAP
