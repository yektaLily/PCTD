"Major privacy concerns. My major complaint has to do with the utter lack of privacy. WHY does Facebook/Instagram need my health info, browsing history, tracking location, contact list, identifiers, purchases, financial info, sensitive info to post a picture?"
"Data Privacy Control. Why would Instagram need my data in Health, Fitness, Financial records, Sensitive Info and audio files among other things? And why isnt there a way to stop the app from collecting this data?"
Privacy. I have a major problem with how Instagram and Facebook handle their users data. I do not want to be filmed or recorded or my information sold. I do not want Instagram to have access to anything on my phone unless Im posting if. I do not want women and minorities to be targeted and have their accounts shut down because they show some skin or post their onlyfans when actual racists incite violence. Its honestly ridiculous
Instagram collects your data and censors freedom of speech. I do not agree with the way Instagram (Facebook) censors freedom of speech. Censors peoples bodies. And data mines all of your information. Not ok
Social media. Designed to take your information and access to your privacy
Look how much data they collect. Why does Instagram need to kmow all this stuff?
"Privacy. Instagram sells so much data to its advertising companies by all means necessary would advice others to avoid the Meta universe, your data would be sold and they would profit off it"
DATA POLICY. PLEASE READ DATA POLICY Instagram is now a creep just like most apps but. They actually went above and beyond to creep you out. And they dont want you finding out its in fine print. They have ownership over photos even if its in your camera roll seriously read the whole thing it takes for ever but they are doing some weird stuff on the other side. Screw you gram
"Ads, privacy infringement, and content ownership. Slightly less than half of what I see as I scroll through my feed is actually content from accounts Ive chosen to follow. The rest is from ads and accounts that Instagram WANTS me to follow. And I never see some content for the accounts I follow at all because of Instas algorithms.On top of that, Insta [Meta] owns ask content that you post.On top of that, they have access to many parts of your phone and collect your information.Im nearly ready to leave the platform for good. Its nothing like it was when I joined"
"Too much data collection. Before you use this bare in mind its owned by Facebook. The amount of data it collects on you is vast - your financial data, your contacts, health and fitness data and on and on and on. These people will know more about you than you do in a few days. Its a high price to hand over your privacy so your mates can see a photo"
"Why financial & health information???. I do not understand the need for Apple to share so much information from my device to Instagram without an option to opt out. I do have the option to delete the app and login from the browser however, that is not the kind of customer experience I initially signed up for. Over access to information by a company that currently owns monopoly and continues to merge my data across platforms is always helped by another Giant. Apple &amp; Facebook, this may be my rare reviews but hey well, you deserved none of that single star"
Review. Policy that is being changed is an invasion of privacy and Instagram should not have the power/ freedoms to be able to have access to everything on our phones from our photos and texts to our exact location
Give us our privacy. Privacy is important. Policies allowing all our information to be documented are not right
"New Privacy Policy is invasive. Used to enjoy using the app. It was great connecting with friends and family but recent changes to the privacy policy has left me with serious concerns. It is invasive to have access to all the information on my phone, including my contacts, having the ability to activate my camera without my knowledge or consent, and use my microphone to listen in on my personal conversations at your free will. There is more to it but you get the point. Not cool Insta "
"Your personal data is worth money. Boo to insta, just one tentacle of Facebook. Nothing innovative here"
"Over the intrusion. Instagram, Facebook & now Tiktok all collect your personal information from your devices the second you start using their app. It states this in their privacy policies. All other apps request tracking but give you the option to denims them that ability. Well not Facebook, Instagram, or Tiktok. Nope, these apps only allow you to use their apps if you submit to their need to have access to your private texts, contacts, emails, payment/cc information, and more. Well, I for one will not support an app like that, and Im surprised Apple allows it"
"Instagram no wants to track everything. Just read the app privacy. They want access to everything on your phone. This is 1984, zuck wants all your data. These people are sick"
"Steals data, supports racism. Facebook and Instagram steal data and suppress minority thought"
Sneaky privacy breach by Facebook and Instagram. Could you go ahead and clarify what other data means on the App Store privacy section  section? Other data could mean anything
"Recent policies. In regards to instagrams recent change in their terms and services, it gives them the ability to do whatever they want with your information, since the new terms are so loose. (Call logs, SMS history, Live camera analysis, address book etc.) You have no rights or privacy under this platform, you are being sold. Disgusting"
Do not let this app track you. Instagram and Facebook are threatening to charge users if we dont give them access to OUR personal data that they sell off to other companies to make money. They should be paying us for our personal data that they profit from
"Bias. As an entity of Facebook, user privacy is not a priority.  More importantly, censorship is a major issue that Facebook and the wholly owned Instagram entity supports. This has and will continue to be implemented through their flawed algorithm. Users of this application need to be fully aware of what is occurring and ask themselves is it right to continue to support this ideology by using this application"
"Privacy. Me personally, I do not like that you can collect our call logs and metadata history. I do not like the fact that you can see what we do through our camera. Thats an invasion of privacy. I understand making suggestions based on search history throughout the app, but this is going too far. Research for innovative good? Or do you mean your interpretation of innovative good. You can still do research and collect information without being so invasive. If I look for a job on google I dont need you suggesting adds on Instagram that dont work. If I look for an apartment on a completely different separate app, I do not need you suggesting anything for me. I used a different app for a reason. I get tired of seeing the same things on Instagram. I dont need you controlling what I view or limiting what I view. As well as being able to disable somebodys account because your guidelines are too strict and sensitive. Theres no reason to delete nude photos. For example if a woman wants to post a nude photo of her breast to spread awareness of breast cancer why delete the photo when you can sensor it and say its sensitive content. I get deleting photos because the content might be explicit, but if its for a good cause and not the wrong reason then be lenient"
"No privacy. They steal your data, they spy on you, they listen on you and they dont care about your opinion.Speak about something then few seconds later you will find ads about it on Instagram and Facebook"
"New policy changes. I used to absolutely love Instagram. I love pictures and getting to see so many artistic eyes, being able to see all different sides and viewpoints of different people and walks of life. However, now because Instagram has decided it is ok for a social media app to integrate into every aspect of your phone/life and technology (ex: watching facial expressions, tracking your website history, your photos, gps, places you frequent, contact list, text messages, etc.) I now do not trust this app or its makers in the slightest. Not to mention the amount of censorship has become INSANE People should be able to have their disagreements and have open dialogue and conversation, the makers of this app however only want 1 agenda and side to be shown. This goes against everything human beings should be. Disgusting"
"So much for privacy. I loved Instagram pretty much up until it was bought out by Facebook. Since then its gone completely downhill between censorship and the new privacy policies. Instagram I do not consent to you data mining my texts, calls, contacts, emails, etc and using my cameras to see where I am, how Im reacting to content, etc. and selling that information to your business partners. The app has been deleted and while I will miss the platform because it was truly a favorite way to connect with ppl I care more about my personal information. Whats that saying, when something is free that means your the product for sale?"
NO Privacy. Every other app has upgraded to not having access to all of our photos because of the severe data you extract to my phones without our knowledge. Like every other app. SELECTED PHOTOS SHOULD BE MANDATORY- Why would I give you access to videos and photos prior to downloading the app that I do not want on Instagram. Why do you need access to that information?
"Not safe for you data. They steal everything and sell your information to third parties. Not safe and disgusting our government allows this. I suggest everyone delete FB, Instagram and Twitter"
Zero Privacy :(. This app tracks everything about you and then sells that data to advertisers and whoever else they want - you have no control over your live with Instagram/Facebook/Whataapp installed in your phone :(
Sharing private data. Instagram is violating the privacy of people and keep changing the rules. Very shady practices
"Private info. Its absolutely disgusting that you think you have the right to have access to our phone books, private texts and even see via our camera and what we post on OTHER sites. You have Facebook are the example of what it looks like when COMMUNISM begins to take over"
Privacy Nightmare. Just look at the App Privacy label. Facebook bought Instagram and turned it into a machine that collects and and sells your data. Dump it and find a social app with a clean privacy label
Instagram sharing your info. Deleted because the new policy gives them access to both ur contact and text messages.  Super overreach
IG collecting bio-data. Ive had Instagram for 8 years. About a month ago I started to get requests for video selfies. Its a frustrating process where you have to turn your head slowly in numerous directions. Its used in collecting bio data. There is a good chance IG is targeting individuals with conservative politics. This is both dangerous & illegal
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, stealing private information. This social media is not only addictive it is very dangerous for each users mental health this is because it shows you things that it thinks you want to see, so you scroll and scroll and scroll, when in actual fact you are just seeing the best bits of other peoples lives, therefore when comparing your own life with theirs yours seems somehow empty. Not only this the app makes you agree to an illegal terms of use that states you cannot clear the cashe, meaning that if you want to delete the data its collected on you, you the user, cannot delete the data. Also rated highest amount of bullying on this app Parents be wary.Not only this but there is a new algorithm that will shadow ban you, if you get shadow banned, its usually because your viewers werent liking your material but if you start bringing out good likeable material then you will get less likes.On top of this you cant control who you follow, what I mean by this is once you started following people, if you want to unfollow a large amount of people say, 300, you will have to do it in small increments of 50 each day and if you do more than  this, your account will be restricted. What being restricted means is that you are unable to: like, comment, follow and unfollow anyone for about 10 days. This is so screwed up because it can happen to anyone unknowingly. Instagram turned to a bad company as soon as it got into the hands of Facebook. DO NOT DOWNLOADVery biased, very unfair, very dangerous, keep away from children"
PRIVACY. instagram owned by facebook &amp; partnership with google are two parent companies that sell your info &amp; track your every living breath
"This means yall still get information of us while we are not in the app?. As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content"
IG the new facebook. 1. The algorithm2. New terms of use3. Why do you need my photos?4. Why do you need my call logs?5. Why do you meed to analyze my camera?6. Why do you need access to my contacts?7. WHY CANT INSTAGRAM BE FUN ANYMORE?
Excessive data usage and privacy issues. Instagram videos constantly play even though I have limit data usage turned on. It doesnt have a way to turn off videos from playing ever. Facebook owner doesnt care about excessive data usage and collection. Facebook and Instagram use the microphone and camera to monitor users all the time to serve up adds and collect data about you. Apple wake up. How come I cant turn off the GPS in the privacy settings. Guess Apple needs to spy on you too using Facebook/Instagram app software
"DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU WANT PRIVACY. They have created a new data policy basically saying they can do whatever they want with your information. They can access your contacts, camera, etc. do not get this if you want your information private"
"Avoid. Owned by Facebook who have zero ethics, are against free speech, and are happy to use your data for their gain. They also track you across the internet and censor anything they disagree with"
"Instagram is shady. Instagrams new privacy policies allow for spying through your camera at any time. They collect and sell your information. They censor covid information that is not from the cdc. So basically all credible information or new ideas are censored and what is allowed to become trending is cdc information only. The cdc is very deceiving and provides very little data to back up its claims. Social media also banned information about the lab leak theory for a year until it turned out to be true. If it were not for censorship, we could have gotten to the bottom of this much faster"
"Dont Use This App. May I repeat, DONT use this app Instagram is NOT a free service, YOU and your personal data are the product, not the customer. I used and loved instagram for a long time despite how many times Facebook was caught leaking or selling user data in sketchy ways. But every new feature demands you approve the usage of more data from your device, (contacts, location, etc.) and now they are demanding facial videos from some users to use their service. The Facebook company has already shown that it will choose sides and take in appropriate action culturally and politically and it is getting to the point that users have good grounds to feel unsafe or silenced should they disagree with the Facebook corporation on any big topic. This is absolutely concerning and should not be stood for. Use a social media platform with some respect for you, please"
Privacy. The number of things that Instagram tracks about you and is linked to you personally is horrific
Instagram. It is my belief that Instagram and Facebook exploit user data by allowing certain celebrity individuals to access and profit from unique identifiers and authentic artistic and creative posts. Individuals such as Paris Hilton and Brad Pitt whom potentially manipulate others creativity such as Unique Sounds  and Animations into their DJ staging and Background Props.  I think Social Media is a giant Data Farming Cesspool
Connected to Facebook. Facebook is complicit in crimes against humanity by censoring truth. Instagram is involved in child trafficking and porn. Theyre using your data to their own benefit and malicious intent. Protect your brain
Terms of use . Its disgusting what these people get away with. If you use Instagram you have agreed to allow the application have access to other applications on your phone that are completely unnecessary for Instagram other than them collecting your private information so they can continue to exploit for profit with your personal information. JUST READ THE RECENT TERMS OF USE
New terms of service. The most recent tos update has allowed Instagram to access all of your personal data on whatever device you use it on
New Privacy Policy is Criminally Invasive. Instagrams privacy policy is atrocious. Im deleting the app after reading how Instagram accesses everything from my phone. Truly appalling
"Good but. I like the app and I enjoy looking at dogswhat I dont like however, is the amount of my private data that is taken..facial recognition?? Sensitive information?? Why does Facebook need all of this. Is there anything that we actually get to keep???"
"Too invasive. Instagram should not be allowed to access my information on my personal phone through their app. This updated terms of service gives way too much ability for the app to get into everyones personal stuff on their phone. This app does not need to know about anyones personal information, other than what they post on the app. This terms of service should be changed immediately"
No privacy. Owned by Facebook. Too many ads; around 25% of posts in my feed are ads. Dont trust it even with my camera and mic permissions disabled
"Data sharing. How come other apps have the information like who is seeing their account, how many followers they have, who has unfriend or block the user.Please clarify this"
"Invasion of privacy. Instagram used to be great. But NOW they changed there policies and can spy on your texts and link to other devices, connect to your camera and a whole lot more. My whole family has deleted this app and Facebook until these companies get it together"
Instagram. It&#39;s a good app but I don&#39;t like privacy policy
Just curious. Ive requested my data for Instagram and never got it what now????
We want our privacy. Dont like how our personal information is shared
"whats with all the tracking?. i really dont appreciate how instagram has access to my device and what i do on my device, as well as my GPS location. how is that allowed??? #stopzuckerburg"
If you want to Give up your privacy. Government controlled social media platform
Privacy. Thank goodness for Apples new privacy tags. WHY do you need access to our health and fitness information under advertising tag? Not to mention other private information that you dont need? This is all so scary :O
"Violation of privacy. Was willing to put up with the already invasive terms of service because I enjoyed the app, but this new update to the terms of service crossed the line. So I am deleting the app. The new terms of service which you automatically agree to by continuing to use it (which is stated in the term) gives them permission to have access to all information in all apps AND all computers you connect with wirelessly. Thats literally everything. Banking, medical, passwords, photos, text messages. The terms also say they can access your camera with no limitation related to just using Instagram. Where it states what they will use our information for it gives the vaguest garbage about enhancing well-being"
Facebook is an evil corporation that sells your data and doesnt care about you. As above
ADs. I dont like how I talk about something with my friends and that same thing pops up on my feed. Its like instagram listens to my conversations and is an invasion on my personal privacy
Terms and Conidtions. I dont like the fact that they collect all data. Sometimes theres just things that you wanna remain private which concerns me. Consumers are just helpless because we cant do anything about it
"New Privacy Policy is Criminally Invasive. Instagrams privacy policy is atrocious. Im deleting the app after reading how Instagram accesses everything from my phone. Truly appalling And Instagram banned Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Im finished. Delete the app"
Tracking your every move. Instagram continues to push harder to track your every move and take away more of your privacy little by little. Instagrams new terms and conditions mean it can use your camera and phone speaker when ever it wants even while not using the app. Instagram can also gain access to all of your text messages and contacts meaning nothing is private. This is only the start
Privacy concerns. The new terms and conditions are so scary. I encourage you to read and research them for yourself. There has to be a different social media platform we can use that operates ethically
"Data aggregator. Holy crap look at all the data this company collects without your knowledge. I would avoid downloading this app. Why do you need health and fitness, financial, physical address, along with other data pieces? Someone needs to open a class action law suit against these guys"
Instagram and Facebook have done a poor job. Instagram and Facebook have done a poor job when is comes to moderating its content.   I get flagged for community guidelines violations for harmless pictures of my cat or motivational memes.  All of my pics that have been flagged and removed would considered safe for all ages and not mean or discouraging to any person or group.  Requests to Facebook and Instagram to resolve have gone unanswered.  Their model is to harvest and sell your data to potential advertisers and have its very users become the product   they sell
"Privacy. Instagram doesnt value your privacy you as individual should value it. Take steps to protect your privacy. Mental outlaw, Eli the Computer Guy and Rob Braxman tech are great sources. Cheers people"
No privacy. No freedom of speech. Does not work. Censoring is so high I can barely flip my phone without having to jump over Instagrams information barriers. This is looking more like a government controlled app everyday. There is no privacy or freedom of speech
"They own everything:. If you havent looked through the privacy policy, make sure you do. They own you email, phone number, sexuality, children, location, data, ethnicity, religion. And any photos or videos you post are now theirs. If you posted a picture of you child or dog, they now own that picture. If a data-collector or someone/ business wanted that picture, they could pay Instagram for it. Does that seem fair? I think not. Change this and dont use Instagram"
"Privacy. Deleted because according to the new Terms and service Instagram has access to your SMS message history, contacts on your phone, camera, and DMs. Over all I dont like the new privacy stuff"
Uses your facial looks and sells it to other large companies. When you use a filter or take a selfie. Instagram uses a computer to detail everything about ur face. And sells ur face features and other things to other privately owned companys. Facebook too dont forget about clapchat I mean Snapchat 
Sell yourself. Instagram was created using Facebook template of information gathering. Want to give your personal information to countries and companies to be used against you.Remember you are the product they make money from
"Privacy?. I have noticed there has been a new update, and some of the features are taking away our privacy. For instance they are allowing them selves to look through our camera roll track our search history and look through our camera roll, all without our knowledge. This is not okay Instagram, you are invading our privacy and by doing that you are not obeying Americas fourth amendment (the act of privacy)"
Privacy. Im not happy with instagrams invasions of our privacy
"Too much privacy breaches and they know it . Removed my Facebook a couple years ago for this exact issues. Allow the user control of their data, magic word being privacy, have more control of accounts deleting it, 3rd party ads and apps, always running to see what websites you use what ads you click on no matter the app. Too much infringements on privacy and rather then take responsibility it chooses to avoid legislation by knowing the politicians and government entities are too slow and ignorant to act"
Too invasive. I dont want Instagram and its affiliates automatically having settings  which make it too easy to give/receive too much of my personal information. I Wish those settings were more easily on the side of my privacy
"Corruption and Abuse of Trust and Privacy Rights. I am deleting both my Instagram and Facebook accounts. The new terms of service released by this company are offensive and inappropriate. I do not give instagram the permission to:- copy all my texts- copy all my contacts- track my movement everywhere throughout the internet- know my exact geographic location - use my camera without my knowledgeAnd so many other disrespectful, intrusive and otherwise immoral and un-American terms of service. If these are your terms of service than I no longer require the use of this service. I will take my interests and support elsewhere"
"This app acts like a spyware. Instagram used to be a great app before it was bought off by Facebook. If you didnt know this by now, FBs new term of service allow them to spy on you. They can see what youre doing thru your camera, see your searches, have access to your other accounts like email, bank account, etc. Heres the question, why does a social media app like this need access to all thise things that 1984 big brother needed?"
"Privacy. App heavily restricts freedom of speech also they gather your information while you use the app and when you dont....if you share your contacts, microphone or camera they save the information and store it so they can build a report/file on you so they can market you consumer goods thats why if you say something like  wow nice car and then you get advertisements for a dealership its because they listen to your microphone also they state this in their privacy policy but its very difficult to decipher BE VERY CAREFUL THEY GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE Also they have no care for the 1st amendment they also change your feed to change your thinking PARLER IS A MUCH SAFER OPTION"
Data privacy cost just too high. Good social platform ruined by too much data collection from my phone. Good bye
This App is Basically Just Spyware. Once you put this app on your phone all your privacy is gone no matter what options you select. Facebook will completely and willfully disregard your desires and track everything you do on your phone and sell your information to their partners
Fact checkers. The fact checkers have no citations or sources of information. it is against my freedom of speech to censor my posts. it is against my privacy to look at posts of mine that are not public. Instagram allows the censoring of the freedom of speech
"Terms and conditions. Yall are taking away our privacy and thats so weird, like y would yall wanna watch us thru our camera, and listen to us thru the microphone, if you agree to the  terms and conditions it basically gives them access to your whole phone( Every picture you have ever saved to camera roll they now have rather you deleted or not, they can also see what ur doing off of the app as well, like what you search,etc). Not only is that illegal but it is disgusting to think that someone is probably watching you when all you wanna do is look at your feed"
Violating your privacy. Instagram is now collecting information from all apps in your phone including banking apps. It also is collecting information from your microphones and video camera. Very scary
"Ive been using Instagram for years now but. Ive been using Instagram for years now and Ive always found it super appealing, my favorite out of all the social media Ive had. I like how its set up, and I have no problems with the over all performance. In any case the only thing I dislike about it is the video-call lay out simply because its not the most visually appealing, but thats never been an actual issue for me. However, these past 2 years its been getting really annoying. Ive had to change my password about 3 times because of claims that Ive connected my account to a like/follow gaining app. This is something I truly didnt do. Even if someone wouldve somehow done it without my knowledge, changing my password this many times shouldve been enough for that to not be the case any longer right? But thats not really where it ends. They dont exactly have any type of customer support and in their help page theres nothing that gives any type of solution to the problems Ive been having. Another thing is the norms and regulations. The idea of it is great, but it doesnt exactly work. My account has been blocked or restricted so many times at this point I might as well not use it. And youd think Im doing something super harmful or insensitive to other people or something, but thats genuinely not the case. I barely post anything on either of my accounts and when I do its either my pets or pictures of special occasions. I dont comment on posts and the things I like or share on my story arent things that are offensive to anyone because I make sure Im being sensitive even with the likes I give. Yet somehow they claim I am violating their regulations and my account is blocked to protect the community but I never know what they actually claim Im doing wrong. This makes it really annoying and at this point I have an account I gave up on using because Im tired of changing the password and another one that keeps getting restricted for no reason at all. Now, Im not just angry about them doing this to my accounts, but what truly sets me off is the fact that a friend of mine reported child pornography and Instagram responded by saying it didnt violate any regulations. How is it that theres pages getting reported for child pornography, exploitation, racism, bashing LGBTQ+ and they dont violate regulations but other people get notifications of them violating policies for things they havent even done? This is not something that has only happened to me but that my friends have experienced too so its an ongoing thing and Im sure theres more people that have experienced this. Its really a shame because this is not a bad app but this issue isnt being handled well"
Instagram. This is a great way to call or text your friends without using data and a great way to share all you photos and videos across the world I really recommend this for every one
"Stop monitoring peoples lives. Instagram, Facebook and other apps should be a way for people to be entertained not worry about what information is being stolen"
Massive data scraper. This application will grab all data you may unknowingly give. The data will then be used to bombard advertisements on you. Little known data that may be used is metadata. Every time you upload a photo the data will be sold to advertisers. Lets work together and force Instagram to reduce the data taken. For every photo you upload remove all metadata. For every advertisement block and hide the ad. Make sure tracking is turned off
Apalling. Until IG comes clean about their use of private data and their political agendas people shud probably stop  using it- i no longer trust IG to do the right thing and wud not recommend it
Spying Theifs. I have heard news that instagram will now have the ability to go through our devices according to the new terms and conditions and working with the government being able to look and hear us through our mobile devices and see what we are doing and what we have done on the internet. Although this may not be true im playing it safe and deleting the app until i hear and see this isnt true. Be careful for everyone using this app
"No Privacy. If I text a friend about something, I get ads for it. If I google something, I get ads for it. I never consented to this app using my data. This is not ok at all. Im sick of it"
"Ads and no respect for privacy. Just read the app privacy labels, its disgusting. No respect for privacy whatsoever. Ever since Facebook bought Instagram, it went downhill. Facebook is evil"
Spying. Instagram you have to do batter. Your nee terms of use is so vague and its obvious youre just trying to access everything. It is not okay nor ethical that your using or camera without our knowledge of it and analyzing our data
Deletes accounts. Instagram deletes accounts it doesnt agree with. Freedom of speach is gone from big tech. If you didnt already know. You cant talk about certain things that go against their one sided agenda. Globalist socialist companyprobably because Facebook also owns it. Facebook was a cute and clever way for the government to get all of our private info and they have succeeded. Now they are power hungry helping to pay people to rig an election to favor their biased political candidate
Capitalism ruined Insta. You guys only care about money and selling data. The shopping part was a HUGE mistake on your part. Deleting all facebook related apps once your new privacy policy comes into effect. FACEBOOK MONITORS ALL DEVICES IN YOUR HOME AND SELLS INFO TO PRIVATE OWNERS. Corporate trash
"The dark side of FB is out. If you want to be spied on, tracked, your browsing data and location data tracked, this is the app for you. There are numerous write-ups on Facebooks awful practice of the information they collect. It outweighs the benefits of this app. Or the data breach they failed to report early, theyve done nothing about it and failed to tell users involved, you literally have to use a third party app to know if your data was breached. Facebook is not and never will be on your side. And dont even make me start on its bias towards conservatives, and threats to deplatform legitimate and factual information. In many instances they do the right thing with fact checking, but they take that power beyond its original intent"
"Instacensor. Facebooks take over has made Instagram a platform of censorship. They blocked my a count for sharing info and videos that I found in Instagram in the first place. How does that make sense? Metaverse is breaking our laws and rights for freedom of discussion and debate. People are paid to report you, for any comment they find hateful, hate is a human right"
"privacy. instagram please put privacy on my added friends, don&#39;t put them in the order I add them, put privacy on my likes, impossible to use and the stalkers are watching my life"
"Breach of privacy. There is no app in this world which will allow users to use the app for free of cost. It comes with a price and if it is free then it is making you pay somehow. Instagram monitors personal emails, tracks locations &amp; messages, phone activities and can see us via camera then shares our data with many organizations outside. I recommend all to save yourself. May this facebook, instagram and whats app suffer billion dollars lawsuit and get banned"
"new terms of service are absolutely appalling. Instagram updated its terms of service that basically allows it to draw information from every part of your phone. Text messages, call logs, tracking your face through the camera, access to devices on your wireless service, accounts on your device (loosely defined which means it could be bank info, credit card account info, etc). Big tech companies like this need to reel way back on the data their collecting... its appalling. Deleting the app"
"Privacy nightmare. Jesus Facebook is a terrible company. Good thing I can disable all the nonsense Instagram asks for. You dont need my search history, you dont need my health and fitness data. Awful company with no morals and ethics. Cant wait for the govt to break up Facebook and make Instagram its own company again"
"LOOK AT THE:  DATA LINKED TO YOU & DATA USED TO TRACK YOU. Enough said. Dont use this app. In fact dont use any app whose privacy policy allows it to COLLECT and STORE ON THEIR SERVERS essentially all of your personal contacts, photos, videos, addresses, purchases, financial info, location, and potentially even record what youre typing or speaking. Thank you Apple for forcing companies to disclose how they monitor their users"
This is a data collection app. This app collects the most personal data of any iOS app. It also censors and suppresses certain political topics and posts. Absolutely no support when there are issues with your account - you have to wait weeks. Disgraceful
"Love the app, but. I love I can use the app to keep track of all my friends and other organizations and bands and people I am interested in. But the sheer amount of data that Facebook rakes in from your device is both unnecessary and intrusive. I really want to keep the app, but I am on the limb as to whether I want to keep it on my device collecting my data. My main concern is the data lost from facebooks data breaches since they clearly cant or dont want to protect their own data and that of their users"
"Privacy. For now one star, i hope if facebook or instagram own instagram they would not let anyone sneak into privacy of everyone"
"Facebook and Instagram are complete trash. If you look at the privacy label, itll scare you away so take a look"
"Data strip mining and no regard for user privacy. If you use Instagram just know that every inch of your data is being mined so that Facebook can further exploit you. Even if you delete your account, copies are stored on their servers forever. I dont get how this is legal. Trash app. Trash company"
"Privacy Policy isnt private anymore. Umm... whats up with this new privacy policy?? Its not even privacy at this point. You guys are doing entirely too much. You honestly dont need to be on our lives like that. Accessing our cameras and microphones (without being in the app), accessing our search history and data yea its a no for me. Absolutely disgusting. . Do better"
"Terrible Updates. Ive been on this app since 2014 and I do not like any of the updates in the last few years, because its turning into Facebook Very few people actually like Facebook at all, and the ones that do constantly complain about how confusing the layout is. Therefore, why turn an actually popular platform into Facebook? We all know Instagram was bought out by Facebook, but whoever is creating the updates is ruining the app and its going to eventually drive people to a better option (just like how, 10+ years ago, everyone fled away from Facebook to Instagram). Specifically, change the bar at the bottom back the way it was (with only a few options, including the likes/activity, explore, and post a photo buttons), stop with the whole shopping and reels stuff, and most importantly, change the system back to showing photos chronologically. That brings me to my next point, which is also related to Facebook. One of the biggest complaints about Facebook is how it has some bizarre system on which posts get cycled through other feeds and which dont? Like how two people could have the same amount of friends, but one persons post gets seen 150 times and the other is seen 3 times, and its all based on activity (liking, commenting, following people, etc)? Well Instagram now has the exact same system. They do NOT show things chronologically like they used to, but randomly pick and choose what to put in your feed, leading to you see posts days or weeks after it was posted (or never seeing it at all) even when you follow the person. Nobody likes this system. If Im following someone, I like their posts, and want to see their post regularly and chronologically in my feed. This leads me to my last point. Every creator who isnt a huge account is absolutely terrified of instagrams shadow banning. I see people post all the time telling others not to like several photos at once and things like that, to try not to get shadow banned. Its the most ridiculous system because it can be triggered by literally anything (you liking too many pictures, following too many people, someone else liking too many of your photos, refreshing your page more than a few times, etc). Worse though, they dont tell you if youve been shadow banned, so you cant report it if they made a mistake or know when it is okay to resume activity. They just stop putting your posts through others feeds for an indefinite amount of time (so you post and get 1-2 likes instead of your normal amount and just have to figure it out, and leave your account alone for a day or two). I know that they do this because they are an incompetent team and terrible at catching bots, but the system is highly discriminatory towards the many smaller accounts (who do these actions in the first place because its the only way to grow and for Instagram to push their posts through others feeds). People end up having to monitor every move as to avoid the shadow ban. Instead they ought to tell you theyve shadow banned you (and for how long), and give you the chance to complete a CAPTCHA to prove youre not a bot, or report the banning as a mistake"
Basically Facebook with photos. Data collecting machine owned by Facebook. Deleted both months ago and my quality of life has been greatly improved
1  for new update and new policy. Instagram was once my go to app for all things entertainment but since the new policy update makes it sound like there is no privacy and therefore DELETED.Ill stick to other apps. Goodbye forever
"Update treating us as wallets. Horrible update. I cant see my friends posts and now, shopping being a bigger aspect of Instagram doesnt make it feel like social media- it makes it feel like Instagram is using us as wallets.I understand using social media for business. But making it such a central point not only confuses users but shows where instagrams priorities lie.Ive had my own account locked before because I was using an approved scheduled. Meanwhile, there are people with tons of followers who regularly break the rules- specifically when it comes to indecent exposure to children. Oh, did I mention that? Instagram is for 13 and up. They have no option for +18 content- which they should. On top of that, the algorithm makes it harder for me to see my own friends and the people who I follow. Instead, its constantly sponsored posts or recommended accounts.I constantly am also getting bots trying to get me to follow people who already have a large following. Im pretty sure that is against the rules, but They all continue to do it without repercussions. Again- I got penalized for using an approved scheduler to share my photography and modeling work. Ive always made sure to follow the rules. Others are literally spamming others and creating bots for followers and go without issue. The quality of this app has TANKED. I will absolutely be using it less, and will be converting to using a platform that isnt connected to facebook or Instagram"
"Why does this is app insist it knows what you want/like?. First they force an algorithm on you, and now they clutter your feed with suggested posts. I dont care about what Instagram THINKS I want to see, its so annoying to have a company care more about advertising and collecting information about you to then try and sell you stuff. Let people use it how they want Stop letting celebrities and big brands take over everything, it not always about them. You keep adding all these features that are portrayed as a benefit to users when its not"
"Privacy. Dont like to be tracked by IG, FB or WhatsApp"
Fact checkers. It has gotten to a point where someone can post a picture of trumps face with no caption and the screen is then spammed with Instagrams fact checker of the election results better yet that fact checker has gotten to the point where people and base a opinion and fact checker tries to fact check it. Its so overwhelming that Im deleting it... I dont care if a lot of people I know use Instagram. Im not dealing with the leaders of Instagrams political agendas and opinions to be forced down my throat Im officially moving on to a different form of social media
"Media Control. Ive noticed that there are a lot of POC who are not being shared and getting the recognition that they deserve, just because theyre different than the society norms. I think its absurd that someone who is not of color can post something and they will have more views, the algorithm has been forced down our throats. White skinned Norms are able to do more on this site. I think its ridiculous the idealism thats being pushed on us. Get it together Instagram. Using the statistical data for what you think who I am based on my skin color does not give you the right to control what I see on this app"
Other than the lack of privacy. Instagram is fine. Wish it wasnt linked to fb. And everything else. Fine for the end of the world
INVASION OF PRIVACY. Instagram listens to everything you say and shortly after you mention something in a conversation over text or in person youll receive an add for it on your feed. Listens and sees literally everything you do
"Truf. I really wish privacy was a thing when it comes to them but when it come to gettin something through the female you want it too, you can always rely on insta and Facebook lol"
Selective. Instagram is selective and it is NOT a free social mediaIt SELLS your private information to other companies too
"Safety and privacy. Instagram has become a very dangerous site to use. Recently, I dealt with a third party data breach and was sent harassing messages by random anonymous accounts. My information was there. My email account was there and was linked to many different accounts for work and schooling. The breach gave someone that email. My phone number was there. The breach gave that. I deleted the account, set up two factor authentication, and made a new one. And once again, theres been a hack. My profile picture was changed to some woman I dont know. The account followed 15 different accounts, none of which are in a language I understand. A different email was attached to this account. A phone number as well. Whoever got into the account got that information. This app is becoming a waste and just an easy way for people to get your information. Instagram is follow its parent, Facebook. Dont use the company unless youre ready to deal with hacks and the risk of losing information"
Not for me and my community. Instagram which is part of Facebook has become a toxic social media platform. They started this downhill journey by collecting our personal data and using it for their own agendas and ads and AI behavioural data collection. We the ice tip of that when Apple wanted to change how its users data is collected. FB was not happy about it. They live and breath personal data collection. Instagram and Facebook encourages extremists and extremism by limiting our access to info that doesn&#39;t challenge our opinions but rather push us to the extreme. We saw that clearly during the trump era and we still see it trough white supremacy groups.Instagram and Facebook has showed time and time again a bias when it come to dealing with my fellow Muslim and Arab community. Censoring content thats very relevant to our causes. Their pro-Israeli approach was clear in the event that are happening recently in Palestine and Gaza. Blocking content that show the Israeli gov. War crimes and horror attacks against the Palestinian civilians. Limiting the access to posts and videos about the subject represents limiting  free speech rights. I cant wait for a better alternative app that protects my personal information and opinion and respect free speech rights
"Spying on users. Has a keylogger and other crap iOS should mandate as illegal. Data collection is out of control, worse every update. Get rid of Facebook for good"
Way to invasive in privacy. This app connects to things it doesnt want you to for example facebook. I had a separate Facebook account I didnt connect to instagram so when someone got into my account and got me banned it went over to my Facebook and now I cant access them all because of a simple mistake
"In plain sight now. The terms that are applied as of December 20th are ridiculous. Youre saying that we automatically give out consent by using the app for you to take all the information in our phones including but not limited to: all contacts in the phone, all pictures, search engines, camera access, and email information. In addition to that you censor all things that dont go with big pharma or the great reset. Freedom of speech on Instagram is dead, and the more you silence people the more well keep making our voices heard"
"Censoring data. Censoring my content was the biggest issue for me. Not allowing my followers to view my feeds and then blocking fellow followers of my who uploaded similar content.This is propaganda, as this platform doesnt share freedom of speech within reason. It is very censored and bias. No illegal or offensive content was being shared. Except exposing the current events overseas about uprooting civilians. Shame on you. I used to love Instagram, but no longer feel that way"
Horrible. They track and sell your data. Instagram Deletes posts that dont agree with their political views
"invasive. They have access to your camera, texts, phone calls and so on and can send the data and use it for the &#34;social good&#34;. Even when you are not using the app.Too invasive. No privacy. Deleted. What a disgrace"
I herd about your guys privacy policy. I dont Agree with yall taking information from our phones to study who we are and what we enjoy in our lives when i am a being of constant change
Shady survey. Instagram is conducting some privacy invading surveys without stating why and how they need the data they are asking for
"They want absolute power. Even though Instagram/Facebook watches your every move, after years of using their app, they now require a full video face scan to prove youre human. What nonsense. Just weeks before they demanded my phone number. I gave in but then deleted it from my profilebut it appeared later, so clearly deleting does not delete from their data storage. The face mining seems to come at a random time after extended investment in ones account. And there is no way to skip past it. Do it or dont use the app. They say they will delete it after 30 days. Even if they do, with each small submission to their power they break down your will to protect your privacy. Think theres isnt a long-term purpose behind such an unnecessary reason as they improve their technological capabilities? This is a threat to users. Trap and exploit you. What will they demand next? And what will they do with it all?"
"Terrible policy change. The policy has too much access to all my privacy outside of my Instagram. Censoring posts when my profile is already private, going against freedom of speech, and  discriminating sex workers"
"Privacy. I dont quite like how they handle your privacy, and was a bit difficult to find and review my data and delete my account. At least it worked after looking for 10 minutes of how to. App is ok, as social media goes. Lots of reposted content, a bit buggy at times and I rather just use a alternative but it does its job"
"I hope apple or government agencies takes action. Instagram does not care about privacy of the users. It forces (tricks) you to give access to camera and microphone even if you want to post a story using your saved videos or photos. Once the access permission is given, it easily makes video calls to the people. It might happen accidentally as a pocket button or when you accidentally touch a wrong button. You might be in the restroom or shower and it calls people randomly. So concerning that such a huge social media company does such tricks. I hope apple or government agencies takes action"
"No data privacy. Not a good app, awful service, and an the company is trying to intrude our privacy"
Facebook owned. They will track you and use your posts against you
"Privacy issues. Instagram we&#39;re able to invade and break through private accounts and delete peoples stories. It happened many times with so many people This is a crime peoples private life, accounts, and stories should not be manipulated or invaded by any means For everyone who uses this app please take care"
"Privacy nightmare. I put Instagram on my phone so that I could look at pictures. I did not want to be any social media drama queen or anything like that. I just want to look at pictures. The next thing I know the app is asking to connect with all my contacts on Facebook, my phone, and who knows what else. I deleted the app immediately before it could ruin my life"
"So much for your privacy. Read the app privacy policy. Since Facebook took over, its been a nightmare"
Trusting issue. Since Instagram take over by Facebook not liking using it. As Facebook loves to collect user data and sell
Corporate spying. This company along with face book think they can spy on the American people. They will record your face while using the app and they dont care as long as they can ke you in it long. I am tired of these social media companies trying to take advantage of us
"Privacy, censorship and bias. This is my most used social media app however Ive been noticing that my content has been shadowbanned when I share legitimate and verified information about apartheid and occupation. My story views more than halve. Ive noticed some accounts that share information love from a the ground have also been shut down or silenced/restricted. Im not sure why there is this sort of a bias going on but it delegitimises the app. And lets not even begin to talk about the amount of ads that are are now in the app. Appalling, honestly. Will probably be deleting soon"
"Stalking us all. So instagram is now allowed to view us through our cameras and analyze it, records what we talk about, access all of our call log and SMS history. No sir no maam Im deleting my account. As is my entire family deleting their accounts. Will not stand for this"
"Instagram silencing users. Instagram and its head are supporting genocide, systematic racism, and oppression of an entire people. Colluding with forces of oppressive regimes, falsely blaming things on technical glitches while spreading lies. Happy Apple is limiting data now with 14.5 release. You guys dont care about local businesses at all, so dont lie about why you need user data. We are not falling for it. Boycott Instagram"
Only works if u want to buy into their agenda. They collect data from you phone (more so than other apps) and then stop you posting what you want if it doesnt agree with their agenda... censorship all by a media platform and just for money .. the more info they have on u the more ads they can sellAlso they use it to support aggressive regimes spy on their ppl Ironic considering the owner of Instagram is the most secretive person... its cuz he knows hes created a monster and what the effect is
"Cohersion. Many of us of find ourselves on instagram because friends, family and news.  What we dont want its to be coerced to download the app and opened an  account when viewing instagram posts. No, you may not have access to all of my private videos and pictures, no you may not keep copies in the cloud, no you may not sell my data. No, I will not not be a Zucker. STOP COERCING, Zuckerberg"
"Data Collection App. Mandatory App. Instagram has moved into an area of abuse. Why am I saying this? Their are more profile options on the app, than the web browser. Which means they want you to have the app installed. Why would they care if the app is installed? Traffic. The more you use it, the more they collect, the more they sell. You cant even delete your own posts without the app"
Sick of no privacy. Wont load my content because I have a vpn on so they cant control my feed. Continually uses its algorithm to push down or delete any right leaning posts Ive interacted acted with on my suggested feed. Im beginning to hate social media it was a place of free thought and speech but continually becoming a place of manipulation and restriction. As humans we are naturally centrists at our core holding both left and right views depending on the issues but time and time again the tech gods are suppressing one view to elevate their own personal leanings. I hate what Instagram has become an opiate for indoctrinated
You are facebook. Data not safe
"Tracking, tracing censoring and monitoring. Absolutely disgusted in the owner (Mark) for abusing fb and insta. Tracking, monitoring, listening, censoring. Keeping our data and other personal information/details. Ill be deleting my accounts"
"Invasion of privacy. Instagram updated their terms and conditions where they actually look through your phone, messages, pictures, sees your history, contact info, and more. This is ridiculous"
"Too much privacy breaches. Removed my Facebook a couple years ago for this exact issues. Allow the user control of their data, magic word being privacy, have more control of accounts deleting it, 3rd party ads and apps, always running to see what websites you use what ads you click on no matter the app. Too much infringements on privacy and rather then take responsibility it chooses to avoid legislation by knowing the politicians and government entities are too slow and ignorant to act"
"Instagram should not have this information. Got an alert from Instagram this morning that said &#34;Tell us about your purchase experience with King Soopers.&#34; The only way they could have this information is if they are using GPS data for targeted advertisements, as I have never used this phone or Instagram/Facebook account for any King Soopers online purchases. Not only do I already have every targeted advertising setting turned off, and I have location access turned off in iOS settings as well, but this advertising tactic is ludicrous. This is not information I want any app to have access to. Mark Zuckerberg does not have permission to see that information about me"
"What is wrong w you and your new terms of services. Why you need to stalk peoples camera roll instagram?Why you need to know ip addresses  location, contact info, search history, and a lot of private stuffYall were good but this is nonsense"
Privacy. Facebook is terrible
Facebook steals data. Instagram steals ur data and sole
"Used to love it. I used to use Instagram every single day. Until they changed their privacy policy, I see no point in using it. They sell your data to whoever they want and can track you through all the apps you use on your phone. They can see it all. And with that in mind, they lost a user"
"Wow, they (FB) is tracking EVERYTHING now. Thanks to the Apple new privacy disclosures, I get to see what IG is tracking about me, its mind boggling and disgusting. I wish I can post a screenshot, but please look for yourself, its no longer about contacts and such, theyre tracking your financial information, your health information, your search history, sensitive info (which they dont tell us what), browsing history, and they  admit right there they are tracking you across apps and websites owned by other companies. Disgusting, simply disgusting how theyre profiting from selling our data. I am out, goodbye FB, goodbye Whatsapp, goodbye Instagram"
Privacy concerns. Be warned Instagram accesses all your phones data. Listens to your background chat and also analyses your keystrokes for personalised ads. If you care about privacy - this is not it. Do not post your face on this app
"Why is my info being reviewed?. All I do is keep in touch with friends and post cat pictures. Less than 800 followers/following combined. Im not important, just let me have access to my own stuff. I dont have Facebook, this is how I connect"
"TOS Violates Privacy and Rights of Users. Instagram changed their TOS (Terms of Service) which never originally included an in perpetuity clause.  Then, they changed their TOS to allow complete and total infringement of privacy and rights.  They do NOT need access to your contacts in your phone address book, they do NOT need access to your medical records, they do NOT need access to your bank account, they do NOT need to tell you what to do about masks (some people have medical conditions preventing them from being able to wear masks), they do NOT need to claim ownership of your name if you create at domain with the same user name as your Instagram account...READ THE TOS PEOPLE  Delete your apps, clear your caches, and STOP using Instagram.  I can only assume Facebook will be next as they own Instagram"
Great Way to keep in contact with your friends and to see what is going on. I like it a lot. The DM feature is great. I also like how you can post multiple pictures at once and post things on your story. The only issue I have is how Instagram tracks what you do and recommends posts for you to look at. I would like more individual privacy
"Too political, advertisement related, and ZERO real privacy. I had to l leave Insta a while back after having been a user since the beginning of Instagram itself because they dont believe in restricting their access to my camera or microphone. When you look at all of who supports mainstream media anymore its just too uncomfortable and fishy that these social media platforms think they need 24/7 access to our devices. Lastly, Im not for sale so the ads are just too much. No one wants to be force fed ads on here, or Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere else for that matter Way to go social platforms, youre constantly driving your users away"
Bias. If you want an app to mislead the public with information then Instagrams the app for you
Copyright rules. I understand the need for them with protecting peoples identities but if they didnt want there picture or video reposted they should not have put it on the internet where people share and repost videos all the time . Instagram already steals all our data and sells it to other companies or to the government so theyve already seen what everyone has posted why does it matter if I repost it again Im not hurting anyone I make sure to post mostly family friendly type things Ive never said anything bad on anyone unlike others the account I had was all in making people laugh after a long hard day of working and especially with the pandemic people needed it. The other thing is how did yall have enough time to ban me but when I reported an account for posting explicit pictures yall suddenly dont have enough people to check if its true or not like what  it doesnt make sense
"PRIVACY INVASION. Instagram plans to release a new terms of service where you can be watched at all times from your front camera. They will identify items in the background and sell photos of your face- room- posts- and more to companies trying to take advantage of you. DELETE THIS APP, or say goodbye to your anonymity and safety forever"
Horrible new policies. Instagram is attacking its own creators and now has the ability to sell your photos to tech and AI companies. This isnt okay
Ig is using your personal data and they can see what you are looking at. So ig is ues are personal data and they can see what we are doing so say like if same one is looking up pornography on like Safari and you go on Ig they can see it and use it against you in a court of law and they can go back and look up what you look at that in there new update in the terms of services and the Government can see it too so we dont have privacy anymore
"Privacy Issue. This app is extremely intrusive, it is tracking all of activities whenever I am on my phone. It is even manipulating our emotions. A week ago, I lost a family member due to cancer, and when I opened instagram it was showing me posts about people who passed away because of cancer. It was devastating"
Whoa  Zero privacy with this app. If you look at the privacy section of the Instagram description in the App Store and see all of the personal data that they collect  You will be frightened  Im off Facebook.  Now Im leaving Instagram.  Just gross
"Viewing who sends and saves posts. I understand the privacy policies put in place with instagram, but I find it uncomfortable how you can see how many people save and send your posts, but not who exactly. I know I can easily turn this feature off, but I dont want to. Its helpful to see who saves and sends your posts, because if its the wrong people you can easily block them or confront them. If its the right people, youll know what posts they gravitate towards. This could diffuse a lot of paranoia as well for people who feel attacked or constantly watched by people who they dont know"
Privacy. This is a very very bad social app and its very selfish by the managers Handel. Its very bad
Too much data monitoring. Why do you need access to my camera and microphone to post something to my story thats already on Instagram or in my photos?
"Zero privacy, full censorship. Unable to like posts because certain activity is restricted also have checked to not allow Instagram access to microphone and no cross app communication however daily random conversations result in immediate advertisements for the very subject I was just speaking about"
"New Terms. Well I liked Instagram because I could connect with friends and family and share photos with others, but these new terms are allowing Instagram to search my phone Yes I did read the new terms and its a complete invasion of my privacy You cannot use Instagram without agreeing to give them access to all your data, not just the things you do on the app while its open. With the new terms of use, Instagram now how access to anything you do outside the app. Access to payment information and contact addresses are accessible if you sync any Facebook/Instagram account to your phone"
"For sheep only. Instagram is a platform of exploitation.  Facebook takes your data and sells it to marketers who use it to sell you things you dont need.  Their algorithm utilizes the worst facets of human nature to addict you to their platform.  Recent research into social media is finding that platforms like Instagram are directly responsible for suicide, depression, and anxiety. Facebook is making 100s of billions of dollars off of this technology.  Wake up"
"Room for improvement. First off, it should be easier to just share certain photos from my camera roll, I refuse to give anything from Facebook full access to my camera roll. Its so difficult, and my opinion is that this is purposefully done to make you allow access to your full camera roll. The Instagram stories need to go. They are annoying and too much like Snapchat. There should be an ad-free option. Less tracking capabilities for US citizens. The Instagram before Facebook bought them out was great, but of course Facebook comes in and ruins everything they touch"
"Spy. its illegally that  instagram all the time listen and use  phones camera to collect information and sell them for money, our privacy is matter,  u ridiculous app, its not right way to make money"
Mines your data and still cant show your interests. I have been using Instagram for multiple years. When I look things up on YouTube Instagram knows. They barely tell you that this will happen and downplay the severity of their data mining. And despite all the data mining over multiple years they still cant show things on my explore page that I care about. Instagrams false information detector will target you and hide your posts over stupid things while whole flat earth accounts are allowed to continue. Speech is incredibly censored and it is aimed at the average user rather than entire accounts of false information and baseless claims. Use at your own risk. Instagram works essentially the same way as the Terrence and Philip mobile game
"New Privacy Terms are an invasion of privacy. Im not ok with Instagram invading my privacy and having access to my camera, microphone, and content. Simple, and unnecessary"
"Used to be cool. Owned by facebook. If youre still on both of them, spend a few minutes on their policy of sharing your information. You have no privacy online with this company that is actively undermining democracy in the world simply because their owners want to get the money hand outs that the poor in the world wont get"
Instagram. Data used to track you is so creepy
Capitalism at its most exploitive. Ive had instagram since I was like 12-13 and over the years it went from a fun place to share photos and cultivate and online presence into an influencer saturated money grabbing mess. The final straw is that in this latest update they moved the notifications to the top of the screen and replaced it at the bottom with a shopping icon that brings you to a bunch of products that they think youll be interested based on harvesting your personal information Im sick of constantly being advertised to and prodded into buying useless items Not to mention how bad it is seeing your friends and strangers highlight reels of their life 24/7. Instagram is made to make you feel inadequate. Im deleting it and I hope you do to
"A soup of data collection. It is no longer about seeing what your friends and family are up too. It is a data mining app that collects information about you stating it is trying to bring you products you may want as an excuse to do so. Have developers and employees really fallen this far to have no morals or respect for individuals? It also seems as if these same individuals are okay with hiding the truth and spreading misinformation aligned perfectly with what liberals and democrats believe in. Quit hiding the truth and spreading lies. This social media platform has fallen far and continues to fail. Dont forget where you came from, and what country gave you this opportunity"
Facebook Control. Just another form of Facebook nothing but ads Get your information and trying to sell something to you
"Say goodbye to privacy. Facebook is at it again - You essentially have ZERO privacy with Instagrams new horrid terms of service. Read it in detail before installing or continuing to use the app. I will be deleting after I post this review. Additionally, Facebook is continuing to destroy user experience with their horrid feed algorithms. A formerly great social media app ruined. Sad"
"Instagram oh Instagram. Rife with exploitation of its users. I think Instagram and Facebook are great present day examples of how to start with a good business idea and then ruin it over time until it will eventually fail. Just as Facebook though man are on it still feel how much they no longer like it. Etc etc. Instagram has no boundaries anymore. No morality. Artists and creatives, just everyday people made it rich and famous and then the businesses are bought and ruined by big tech and exploitation all for the sake of money. Instagram exploits its audience, disrespects their privacy, disables its viewers from having their own audiences and then continues to further and further tweak the algorithm. Sounds a lot like what Facebook has done and we see how many people left it there, myself included. When will we as a collective humanity say enough. Instead we continue to give and give, forced to reach our own audience by paying for the connection. Its not hard for Instagram to allow everyone to see everyone else, to be easily found. Its that they withhold it now... for money. Every other post is an advert, my own followers cant see me but see random explore images. You cant opt out of anything anymore. Narratives are spoon fed to you, you cant even report ads for the one reason many actually want to hide them: because we didnt ask for them, because Instagram has no boundaries and is that stalker wed all tell our best friend to leave who wont stop clinging and humping your leg. At least its a comfort to know I no longer care if it fails, nor do I have any issues anymore with disengaging from it. Likes dont matter at all to me now, nor do followers and Ive no problem deactivating account indefinitely these days, in fact I think its a good practice to stay sane and shut it off for even a year at a time. The real world is really there, and needs our attention. These apps also have begun massively massively censoring anything or anyone with opinions beyond the accepted narrative. Ive lost all respect for social media platforms. And for all they offered way back when. - friendship with strangers, sharing our art, its just another place now the rich get richer and continue to use their audience for financial gain - and who knows what else. I am certainly theres even more garbage we dont know about. "
Doesnt care about its users and violates peoples privacy. In their new policy update they made it so they have access to all the data on your phone and they actively use your microphone and camera to see what face expressions you make to shape what it shows you. This app very heavily restricts free speech and it bans people for no reason
Privacy update is terrible. We all know that Facebook (who owns Instagram) sells their customers data and doesnt care about our privacy. Drop these immoral baffoons. Cancel your account and delete the app. Email your photos to friends
"Instagram is trash and needs to change. Instagram has invaded our privacy and shadow banned us enough. During a global pandemic and constant political upheaval social media is a platform supporting many peoples livelihoods. We deserve better period. Just like Instagram was created an app that doesnt censor and supports liberation can be created. Change or become obsolete Instagram aka Facebook.  Why did we allow corrupt facebook to buy IG, oh right neoliberalism"
"Tracking. After I updated to ios 14.5, I immediately asked instagram to not track data as the new feature on ios allows you to do. I still notice my ads being tailored to what I have researched on safari. I was recently researching mercedes benz looking for a car and all of my ads have been for mercedes benz. I will be deleting this app. There is no reason for facebook to continue tracking data from users after it has been in legal trouble"
"More privacy on photos. I guess if you make the privacy of IG similar to facebook then its will be amazing ,like i would control who can see my pictures and who cant .UPDATE: RECOMMENDATIONS:The archive tool is one of the best thing that Instagram had done. BUT It would be great if I can see the numbers of archived posts, So I dont over archive poststo see if how many pictures I archived"
"A true and honest review of this social media platform. Distracting, some how Instagram knew about my erectile disfunction before I said a word to anyone, it is useless and conveys a completely inaccurate perception on peoples lives, it just makes people want to sell themselves to nothing, and it collects data in ways inconceivable to anyone who is not familiar with the translation of wavelengths into information. I am not disappointed as I expected nothing more from a modern social platform. However I would like you to reconsider the methods and the obviousness of the extreme invasion of privacy in data collection. I know more than you think about the plans of social media so I suggest you go careful and maybe consider a more discrete and slow transitioned method of ensuring the desired mindset you would like people to attain"
Privacy issues. This company is owned by Facebook all they do is track your every move. Disgusting lack of privacy
"Subpar Standards. If you dont value privacy and advocate liberal ideals, this is the platform for you. Instagrams best days are long gone after its parent company decided to monetize all statistics being harvested on this platform. The last straw was censorship of conservative users. Good luck getting half of your users back on the platform"
"Sissy. Last time I checked this was America. This app along with the majority is an infringement on free speech, I understand its a private platform but face book has monopolized the industry of social media which isnt fair. God forbid we go against the guidelines instagram/Facebook has set, because those folks know all. I rarely am fed post in my search feed about what I actually search for its all a bunch of bologna. You people are awful and should be ashamed of yourselves I just want to share pictures with my friends and look and animals and fishing pictures instead my comments are hidden and Im force fed videos of gays lol"
Privacy Issues. I will never use this app since Facebook owns them
Delete Instagram. Delete Instagram they have access to all your data to include you photos and can view what your browsing
"Privacy. Your new privacy guidelines and the access to ALL my information, being able to take pictures from my camera, see everything on my phone... disgusting. Mark should hang for his actions. Never downloading instagram again"
"Ads, no posts from friends. You wont ever see your friends, its literally ads 24/7. Basically an ad network to collect data for Facebook"
Facebook's influence. 1. Please go back to the simple chronological timeline. Period. 2. Consider allowing each picture be able to be private or public. This all or nothing public/private thing is annoying. 3. Keep cracking down on nudity and scammers in IG. 4. Facebook may own you but we are out here for a reason. To share photos. I'm not on facebook and don't want this to turn into another version of that
No privacy. I might delete Instagram after what I saw and heard about no privacy they are looking at the pictures from our phones no privacy whatever were doing on your phone they want know and thats just disturbing and weird and disgusting and I might put 2 starts instead of three
"The worse app for privacy. According to the privacy report this application has contacted 253 domains or servers to share my information.This is unreal, Instagram that is meta should be banned from the App Store due to the fact that even thoughI deny tracking this app continues doing it and it does not respect the privacy policy set by Apple"
"Privacy outrage. Analyzes your entire photo library, including photo location data, builds a profile on you, and sells your data to third parties. Sign me up"
"lil bubba. The review about insta watching/ listening, read the terms &amp; conditions privacy part it TELLS you targeted  advertising    &amp;   As for using WhatsApp instead , thats also owned by Facebook lolIf youve a mobile phone NOTHINGS private, for only real privacy youll need a burner phone,,   so Im told "
"Cultural Garbage. The concept of a photo sharing app social network that allows for customization and looks amazing, to boot, 5 STARS. What it has become, a corporate-owned, publicly-traded, privacy-invading, advertising machine filled with narcissism, anger, hate, sex, and probably a lot of memes and pictures of cats/food/feet on sidewalks. The whole concept of a machine that decides what you see based on what it profiles you as liking, is idiotic. My needs change, and my social network does not. Corporate owned. He whole purpose is to generate revenue. And it promises avenue generation to its advertisers because its essentially Amazon now and tracks you to show you what you typically buy so you keep buying it. Privacy invading. Your info is sold. Simple. You have no rights. Posting political stuff? Dont worry, they will throttle those posts and force their own agendas anyways. You have no control. Narcissism. Enough said, its a place for people to show themselves off for the sale of generating attention. Disgusting. A true testament to the condition of the world spiritually. Overall, something cool, kinda like Tumblr used to be. But someone always comes along, buys it, and ruins it. Instagram is the new Myspace"
"Just an overall terrible app now. Instagram isnt the same anymore. These updates are annoying. These reels (aka wanna be tiktoks) are annoying, especially wen having to scroll down my main feed and see a row of recommended reels that I dont want to see or even care about. Instagram has had the habit of copying every other app. First they copied snapchat and now theyre copying tiktok.. not only that but the community guidelines are ridiculous now as well. It is no longer a safe community. They are now deleting, blocking and logging people out of their Instagram account on the basis of violating community guidelines for using follower tracking apps. But when it comes to accounts that post pornographic photos videos or promote their pornography websites, children under the age of 13 having accounts, spam or the 2 million bots that exist on Instagram and stalk your account or Instagram story; absolutely nothing is done about them no matter how much you report it. I even had an experience in which I was impersonated. I along with 20 other people I know, reported the account for impersonation... I along with the 20 other people was told that people express themselves differently and the account does not go against community guidelines. I spent an entire day looking for a way to personally get in contact with Instagram (which was almost impossible) for them to then request that I send a picture of me holding my ID, for them to finally delete this account that was impersonating me.. what kind of community guidelines are these? What kind of community is this in general at this point? Its become an annoying, stressful and dangerous social media platform and Instagram (aka Facebook now that Facebook owns it) does not care This is unacceptable"
"Hacks and Spams. You need to do something about the hacks and spams in this social media, My wife account got hack and other people I know got hack to with porn stuff and money stuff. I dont trust or feel safe anymore using this app. When you try to get your stuff back you cant and you cant report the profile because it doesnt let you do it"
Intrusive. When i downloaded instagram I want a social media app not an app that shares information with the government
READ ALL OF YOUR DATA THAT THEY TRACK Ridiculous invasion of privacy. Gross invasion of personal data. Read how they track your prior to downloading app
"Horrifying, Disgusting Targeted Ads & Content. Update: chronological feed only works for some accounts. This is the best feature since Facebook acquired Instagram (and actually was there before acquisition) and I cant even use it :(Update: PLEASE fire your product and ads teams. I have been receiving daily Instagram ads of various mental health disorders that I do not have. and there is no way for the user to regulate the ads at all. Its sickening and the entire team needs to be evaluated for sociopathy.  My last review isnt present, likely due to an app update, but the issues with harassing targeted media still continue. Feed content is so disgusting after recent harassment from California & uc berkeley employees towards app users (very ugly, naked, pregnant, unappealing photos recommended by followed hashtags that have nothing to do with the hashtag). Employees are obviously abusing their work privileges to harass users. Its sad seeing the apps content quality degrade to this level. I also dont have the chronological feature that was announced in the news. Meta doesnt care about user privacy since they wont prevent messages and accounts from being hacked. There should be an option to opt out of being a Guinea pig in this social experiment"
"Brainwashing, manipulative, and suppressive. Algorithms at Instagram does three main things: - Push political agendas of Israel - Suppress human rights violations by messing up with the views on videos documenting human right violations in Palestine and Syria - Invade your privacy by selling your personal information to the highest bidder to sell you stuff and make their users their main product"
"Ya, this aint instagram, its controlled consumption. Ive been on Instagram since 2014. I know this app way better than all my friends. Or at least, I did. The app just focus on consumption, its a tool to enforce capitalism at this point, literally all thats on the discover page is clothing and products for sale or women and bodys trying to enforce whatever the USA seems as beautiful for the time being. Its legit no longer sharing or expanding on ones personal interests. Its so so hard finding people I actually want to follow because at this point everything I get to actually see is all ads for random crap"
Theyre stealing your data. Dont use any Facebook apps
"They steal your information. They can watch you through your camera at all times, even if you arent in the app. The new terms of use allows them to basically do whatever they want. They can check your text history, call logs, etc"
"The terms and service. The terms and service is basically an invasion of privacy. They can read your messages, see your calls, use your pictures without your permission and basically do anything. They can also analyze your cameras so"
Censorship. Censorship is rampant. Instagram and Facebook are inundated by hackers and fake accounts. Posting anything that goes against their agenda will get you silenced. Their priorities are evil
Block bots. Trash bots ruining your platform. Pathetic that Instagram sold this to Facebook. Facebook a platform that lies about data sharing should never have been considered
"Storage. Why does Instagram occupy so much storage, cant they store our data in their cloud or server"
"Privacy issues. avoiding the usual facebook privacy issues, there are some concerning problems here:Recently I can see that Instagram is actively using the camera (seeing the green dot & text in control center) even when Im just reading direct messages or looking at photos in homeWhy? It should only use the camera when Im posting or adding a story Its so shady and weird"
"Just...Why?. Why does Instagram/Facebook keep adding all of these features no one wants? I dont want Instagram TV or movies, I dont want Instagram Marketplace, I dont want to scroll down and suddenly be in a feed of suggested accounts, I definitely dont want a link with Messenger, and I dont want stories. I also dont want you spying in whatever way it is you do that suddenly shows me ads for something I just talked about. I just want to be able to see photos my friends shared in chronological order and comment on them if I feel like it. Thats it. If I wanted the other garbage Id be on Facebook"
"new privacy policy. Their newest privacy policy is a joke and gives them a bunch of access to things in the name of bettering the social world. Give me a break. I&#39;ve deleted it, for the better of my social world"
"Censorship and discrimination. Whats on your mind? Asked Facebook, before it went on to censor whats on your mind... Got a memory of a dictator in mind? Take that memory and apply it to all the social media apps owned by Facebook. Instead of being an open platform for the world to freely and indiscriminately engage in, the Facebook owned social network is being used for the benefit of tyrannical and unjust political parties and is being used as a huge tool to deliberately and falsely influence public opinion by means of one-ended censorship. The saying that you are the product when you are not paying for a service is coming into full effect. We have become products subject to mass surveillance and censorship based on our world views, beliefs and racial background. What we all thought was freedom of expression was an invasion of privacy"
"Awful policy changes. Ive loved Instagram for years, but their recent policy changes targeting s*x workers and s*x educators are horrible, especially since this is being implemented during a global pandemic when many people rely on this platform for income.  The privacy issues are also becoming worse.  I have deleted the app and will not be reinstalling until changes have been made"
"Facebook has ruined Instagram. I joined to see pictures of friends &amp; relatives.  Once Facebook bought Instagram it went downhill.  Like all their other ventures, Facebook appears to be harvesting data for marketing.  Im not willing to give them any more access.  Ill look for something better and more customer-focused/secure"
Instagram is using you for your data. Not a hater I just want in on the hustle
"Good app, privacy issues. Excellent app for photo sharing and social media contacts (personal and professional). My main criticism of the app is the contact syncing and settings which you have to navigate to adjust privacy settings. It is difficult to change these settings if you do not want your account visible to contacts on your phone, etc. The app immediately syncs your information and you have to go to the website or settings page to change this. I also do not like how it tracks your activity (another setting you have to change). These are features of a lot of social media companies that they prop up as ways to connect you to others and pages, but these settings should be simple and accessible upon creating an account. They should ask you clear questions with regards to these details when you create an account"
"Feed algorithm trash. I hate how the feed decides what you see now. The last couple weeks have been me intermittently debating whether or not to keep it. Its like Facebook wants to make Instagram a little less popular now that it owns IG, just to take away some of the bad press on how poorly FB handles privacy and has become a typical huge corporate machine"
"INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK. FACEBOOK GOT HACKED A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND EVERYONE PERSONAL DATA SUCH AS THEIR PHONE NUMBER, AGE, NAME, CREDIT CARD INFO, EMAIL, PASSWORD AND THEIR PICTURES AND VIDEOS PLUS THEIR DMS WERE ALL LEAKED ON THE INTERNET AND MARK ZUCKERBERG FIRST RESPONSE WAS WELL IM NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED "
censorship and invasion of privacy. apps been going downhill since FB bought IG fk your censorship fk your agenda fk your policies
"Awful App, Dont Bother Getting. I downloaded instagram because everyone else was getting it, but I noticed that it says on its terms &amp; conditions that it has access to all your photos, your camera, your call history, your EVERYTHING, even when youre not in the app. I am absolutely digested and disappointed. I had high expectations for this app and it did not meet those standards. I will be deleting my account AND the app itself"
"Just like face booksmh. The whole reason i quit facebook is because it sucked and they dont have any regard to who they sell your info to. But since its meta (go figure) you would think that they would get their $#+ together. Nope one example, i cant even change the privacy on my account because i cant access the blue button to change it. Because you would think that meta and its staff wouldn't overlook such a big detail. But they did. Because they want to put your whole life out there despite your privacy preference"
Read. Just gonna say it Instagram is very like sketchy it can access data from your other apps and can access your camera and microphone at any time
Longer bios & privacy disaster. Bios should be able to contain a lot more info. So annoying.Also this app is a privacy disaster. Why does it notify people your friend _____ is on Instagram as @_____??? I run accounts that I dont want my friends to be notified aboutThere are so many other privacy issues besides just that
"too many ads, bad for mental health. Instagram knows how to get us addicted. It cares more about keeping the users hooked than our mental well being. Even though most social media apps do the same, Instagram is the one of worst ones. There isnt any option at all to manage our preferences and feed. I would&#39;ve given it 2 stars if it wasnt for the amount of ads, both in the main feed and in stories. Also, whenever I like a post or follow a new account, many related spam/bot accounts will start following me. Its been a huge problem for years now, this is both very annoying and make me concern about my privacy. Im limiting myself to only using it on the weekends, and I downloaded their message app Threads (which has 0 ads) to keep connecting with friends. Ive also unfollowed a lot of accounts and now my feeds in chronological order. Here are my suggestions: 1. Less ads in feeds, no ads in stories. Only let one user see a certain small amount (say 3) of ads per day. 2. Give users more options to manage their feeds. (i.e. see more of... / see less of...)3. No posts suggestions. (When users reach the end of their feed, there should only be an option to see older posts. Do not take users to a separate interface/window for the older posts.)4. Let users have the option to turn off the explore page.5. Reinforce regulations on racism / hate speech / bullying.6. Regulate spam/bot accounts. (VERY IMPORTANT)7. An option to mange previous comments users made"
"Great before they tried to get all my other info. Nope, you may not access all of my accounts on my phone and all of my photos. Privacy is a real thing Why would you make your app bad by thinking it was ok to invade mine? I wonder how many other people have not read your new terms of use"
"No privacy. If you read the community guidelines/ terms youll discover that instagram can access your camera at any time, have access to your location, contacts, and so many more. Its honestly so scary why do they want to watch us ??. We need to petition them to not do this.. complete invasion"
very invasive of privacy. forces you to get the app and give personal information to reactivate your account
"Useful and fun, but still plenty of issues. First of all, I dont doubt that I use Instagram differently than most of their users.I use Instagram for three purposes: (a) sharing content from my own life, (b) keeping up with content from my friends/family/coworkers and a select few local/relevant accounts, and (c) updating my business pages with consistent content to drive real-world participation in my non-profit program.What I do NOT use Instagram for is the consumption of random content, even around set themes. I honestly do not care in the slightest what people I dont know are sharing on this app The new suggested posts on my feed are not what I want (thankfully I can snooze them for 30 days, but I want to disable them indefinitely) and the disgusting mess that is the Discover tab is terrible.I understand why ads exist in the feed, but there needs to be a better way to tell the app what ads Id like to see. Its a waste of money for advertisers to show me irrelevant content anyway so if I must see the occasional ad, Id like it to at least be something related to my personal interests.If I want to buy something, there are several places Ill look. Do you know where Id never consider looking? Instagram I dont want that useless shopping tab. Even if I was to find something I like there, Id never connect a payment method to anything thats a part of Facebook (You can call yourself Meta if you want, but youre still just Facebook)Another tab I dont want: Reels. I know, I despised Stories when they came out and now I use that all the time  but Reels is designed around a terrible concept: taking advantage of short attention spans and doomscrolling. If I could only see Reels from accounts I follow, I might be interested. But as I said above, I dont care about random accounts 99% of Reels Ive seen from people I dont follow are extremely low quality and an incredible waste of time.The Facebook app on iPhone lets users hide some tabs. Can I please hide the Shop and Reels tabs on Instagram?A really important point is that Instagram is frequented by teenagers  and that fact makes the abundance of adult content in the app unacceptable. Instagram policies have some imperative protections, but its far from adequate If I had kids of my own, I wouldnt even consider let them have Instagram. Its just too easy to pollute a young mind by browsing this app. Please, get this under control. Start by actually doing something about this content when it comes by in reports, and not ignoring nearly all reports that should result in content removal.Lastly, Im still very frustrated that this app doesnt have native support for iPad. The Instagram team claims there arent enough users to warrant the development and upkeep, but (a) many of those users, such as myself, dont show in your numbers because we dont install the iPhone-only app on our iPads and (b) natively supporting iPad when you already support iPhone is very easy with Apples developer APIs. You could do all of that management on devices themselves, and your servers and whatever else wouldnt need to worry about it. Its not difficult please just do it A feed with multiple columns of posts to scroll through would be great, and Im still really hoping well finally get that someday in the near future.Alright, thats it. My verdict? Instagram is far from great, but I enjoy it for the most part. I wish it wasnt owned by Facebook, but at least that should theoretically increase their budget and update frequency. I want to see Facebook fail, but Id like Instagram to stick around for the time being"
Privacy Concerns. Im considering deleting my account and app due to privacy concerns with the new terms of service going into effect on 12/20/20. Stop spying on us Instagram
"Bait and Switch. So many things to say here - making the feed end after two new updates and then filling it with content I dont follow, taking the + button away from the bottom but putting the shopping button almost in the same place, Instagram is clearly about making a buck off of you wherever they can or controlling what you see. And before you say its the algorithm, Im talking about the interface here. But most concerning are the invasive liberties Instagram is taking with my data. No thanks. IG used to be fun years ago but now its absorbing my time, making me work to see people I care about while spamming me with products and influencers I dont ever want to see. All at the price of them being able to see my location, my face, my credit card info, my browser, my contacts, my private messages. Just like I left Facebook two years ago, Im out "
Instagram Spying on you. Deleted this app & so should everyone else  Instagram AKA Facebook is invading your privacy and tracking everything in your life  Wake up people and move to other platforms that respect your privacy
Lock out. Just because you want our personal information does not mean I have to give it. Its totally unnecessary for a platform for photos. Youve successfully locked me out of the app even though Ive changed my password as requested. I dont want to put my gender my age my country & so forth into your data base. Instagram managed to work for years without it and I most certainly dont want to give you my phone number. Your data base is too easily hacked. Now WHERE is the LOG in??? So complex now

No right to my data. It now wants to track what apps you use They have no right to ask for right to spy on their users Dont let them have that right to see your phones activity or the apps you use. Its your device they did not pay for it

"Full of ads. Instagram home newsfeed use to be full of images from people you FOLLOWED. And the search newsfeed is where youd go if you wanted to see ads/images from accounts you didnt follow. Now, your personal newsfeed is full of random BS ads from other profiles who arent on your following list. Example: I just scrolled through 60+ images  of ads before I even saw a friends post. Instagram use to be better than Facebook and now theyre just as bad as each other"
"Invasion of privacy. I deleted Instagram based on the new terms and conditions of their last update. I deleted FB back in August for the same reason. Access to my microphone, and front camera was already too much. But now you want access to my text messages? Goodbye I am tired of being a marketing ploy"
Useless. This is not a social media app. It is just another online mall. Absolutely unnecessary. Bad algorithm. Bombarded with ads. Cant even keep up to date or in contact with friends via insta anymore. Its whole point is just data mining now without even the thin guise of social interaction anymore. I am saving my remaining posts/archives to my phone and deleting. If you want pics and updates on your friends text them. You want memes? Go to Twitter. Insta no longer offers a unique or useful experience. It is a purposeless mess
WAY too many ads and unreadable foreign content. I like the app but you know they ONLY care about taking money considering every second photo/video clip is an ads. Now they have decided that I should be forced to see content from foreign countries that I dont speak or interest in. I guess it true that instagram hacks your phone to see who is in your contact list and your browser history. Time to delete this hacking spy app from my phone
"Invasion of privacy from you. I DO NOT WANT TO RECEIVED ANY/ NONE KIND OF ADS, BESIDES IS OFFENSIVE YOU ARE NOT RESPECTING MY PRIVACY. STOP HARASSING ME, Instagram/Facebook and/or  all the affiliates to Mark Zuckerberg  DO NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION to share any of my information for any kind of circumstances of any kind of  profit; and:or  advertise in my page  or/and have ANY kind of ads in my page without my permission. You DO NOT HAVE MY AUTHORIZATION AT ALL, Facebook and/or any of the affiliates related to this Co. and/or Mark Zuckerberg are violating my privacy since I signed in Facebook and/or any companies related or owned by Mark Zuckerberg or all his affiliates and since May 2018 became legal to stop using any of my data, If you continue I will leave Facebook and take you to the court of law"
"Opinion. I love the tool that instagram is and how we can connect and create here. But I do not resonate or agree with the new privacy policy. Please consider our humanity (differently than you already have, I know you all care. But we must do better than this.)"
"new terms and conditions means bye bye privacy. DELETE THE APP. Their new terms and conditions give them permission to check your call logs, your SMS history, they can do live analysis on your camera, they can copy your address book and much more. By using this app you are signing away your rights to privacy. Facebook, this is disgusting. CHANGE YOUR TERMS. DELETE THE APP. PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY"
Instagram dont give a f about you. New terms of service are trash. The violation of privacy is incredible
Worse than Tiktok or Wechat. This app has been spying on people and using facial recognition software to catalog people and their personal information. Not surprising since Facebook is a pet rat for the NSA and a little program called PRISM. Why would Instagram need to access my camera without the app being open or even running in the background? Shady big tech shows their true side once again
"GOOD but. Its needs to add more options to make this app truly better than others of all niches Make collections shareable, postable, able to appear on explore pages, the ability to to be notified when someone added you to their public collection Make the ability to make magazine/pamphlets public Allow stories to be promoted dispute having multiple clickable options, so music can be played on post reshares  Allow people to repost story reshares without having to be tagged (most ppl wont tag because it makes sense not to, since youre already promoting the persons post) Make tagged videos (tag) icon disappear after watching the way it does w regular photos  The ability to have hidden captions/story highlights for when someone mutually follows you (to increase the desire to follow someone, makes it fun and personal, adds a layer to social media) Maybe make a map feature, see all your friends picture locations posted on a large map over then span of a week or month. The map can have an explore feature too where you can have maps for certain things like skating videos, fashion, celebrities, food travels, etc.(Its completely change how we see social media by making the world a lot more digestible) Stories should always be shareable without tags if made so, this could increase a desire to post stories being that your thoughts could potentially go viral Make collections able to have group input A choice on how to prioritize the feed, default would be the way its set up now Maybe in the about for users show their follow back rate (a lot of ppl are dissuaded to follow back people w high ratios due to untrustworthiness)  Add more business options, maybe work on a personal link hub like links tree does, or how YT caters to other linked platforms. Expand to Depop or Poshmark pricing, legal issues in scams would just go to PayPal, zero worries. (Ofc this one makes less sense because youd help those platforms in business, but youd have more mutual users making content thatll likely make others stay on IG longer) Create strict criteria for an account to exist so inactive/bot accounts are removed Maybe make the algorithm better in terms of promotions, I pick up traction a lot faster on TikTok than other apps including Instagram Since songs are already available on stories, why not posts or when viewing someones account.(It would make everything so much more personal and creative.) Add the ability for users to narrate their captions for up to 10 seconds (Personalization)"
"Steals too much of your data. Its a good app, Im not going to lie. However, I have gotten fed up with all the user data that they steal. They can see what you do, what you post, what posts you like, who you follow and who you message. They then steal this data, store it in their servers and sell it, then they make money and sell you personal recommendations and ads. This is just ridiculous Everyday I get notifications about people who I might like to follow. People whos interest and followings are similar to mine. Then I see ads whilst scrolling related to my interests as well. This is just too much Furthermore, this app is owned by Facebook and they are the biggest criminal when it comes to stealing user data. That makes my case even worse Please dont download this app. Otherwise be prepared to get your data stolen and to be bombarded with personalised recommendations and ads. Shame on this app"
"No privacy and lots of censorship. IG accesses your phone (texts, photos, camera). These new, or newly disclosed, terms of use overstep boundaries. Not to mention their mass censorship and shadow banning of accounts, whilst maintaining pedophile accounts"
Violation of freedom. Instagram your updates are stupid. Your privacy policy is unconstitutional Spying on citizens isnt normal
Terrible corporate policies. This company has gone way downhill. New updates ruined the look and feel and the terms of service are absolutely terrifying to read. Instagram PLEASE stop spying on your users and their private information
Privacy. The privacy off this app is horrible. You have nothing personal and I really just dont like it
Bad policy. Poor policy and no privacy
Please. please  make Instagram consume less mobile data
"Used to be the best not anymore. I used to love Instagram. Connecting to friends, family and people with like interests. Not anymore as Instagram will actually punish you for using the app. If you leave more than ten comments even if its your own mothers page they block you You are allowed very limited engagement and if you go over that unknown number even if its with friends you have had your whole life they block your account for a week and accuse you of using outside services. Which is funny as they should be able to tell the difference between spam and real actions. This app has steadily gone down hill. Team Snapchat will actually contact you back if there is an error or a mistake.. not Instagram. Your account can get hacked and they do not care. Make no mistake they changes they have made to this app are awful. If your new to social media try snap chat its way better than Instagram. Their tech team will contact you by email and explain in every day terms whats going on and why. Instagram will just randomly block you no reason for community guidelines that dont have clear rules. Instagram has become the only APP that wont let you engage with your own family. Its sad that the best app went to the worst app. Reels is complicated to use. If you need help forget about it, they wont help or respond or look at your issue or glitch. The filters are terrible, and again only ten comments? They actually punish you for utilizing the APP itself. Want to follow 200 high school friends? They block you for a week. Already have 200 friends and like a post on each? Banned. Shame on Instagram for becoming the worst social media outlet out there. If I could give zero stars I would. Download snap chat today. Especially if your not tech savy. Unlike Instagram they care about their user and actually help if something goes wrong. They warn you before blocking if there is a guideline you may be breaking and outline what it is so you dont unintentionally break a community standard. Team Snapchat cares. Team Instagram is to busy making reels on how to use reels. If they are that complicated to make simplify it. Instagram is my least favorite social media platform and Im an influencer so that says alot. Maybe one day they will fix the glitch in the algorithm. Until then know your a number not a name to this team"
Leaving Instagram. I will no longer support Facebook. You  are not the judge and jury. It is not your place to manipulate information
"Thank You InstaSnap. As a Company owned by treacherous data mining Facebook, I only partake in such activity as fun, in order to see who I can rattle. I have no other social media. Social media is a dumpster fire, as far as Im concerned. I do this thing in my regular free time called....uh...reading BOOKS. Thank you for asking"
privacy is soooo 2020. love having my personal data harvested for profit
privacy. just read the privacy report
"What a waist of time. Instagram was so great, so pure, so peaceful place to be, until they sold it to the idiots at Facebook and they became idiots like them. Why do you need to be so greedy and sell your app to the company who believes in one thing only your privacy is not important . Thats what they believe in, and will alway believe in. I feel disgusted using an app that is owned by Facebook, and plus seeing this owned by Facebook pop up every time. It used to be a good place, not anymore. I hope that Facebook and all the companies they own lose business. A company who stands with privacy breaches do not deserve to be on a platform like IOS and do not deserve to be on planet earth"
Screw Facebook. I just want my privacy  Is that too much to ask ?
"Requires a picture of my photo id. Instagram is requiring a picture of my photo ID to unlock my account. They promise to encrypt the data. Hah, no. Dont need this cancerous service. Tried to delete my account but it requires a picture of my ID for that as well"
"new terms and conditions is TERRIBLE. This is a invasion of privacy, its so wrong. You shouldnt have the camera watching you and tracking you. Instagram was much better before Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg) bought it. Please change this, terrible way for marketing and advertisement"
"privacy. no privacy and overall you cant take anything down, its just not good for children or adults"
"Controlling. Instagrams pro-trash and anti-activism. Censoring posts, deleting accounts, asking for personal information in return of reactivating a blocked account"
Privacy issue. If i am going to write a story and its a picture and I will write some words on the picture I am sharing. Why do I need to give permission to enter my microphone and my camera if I wont be using them? I feel like Facebook is not giving any space for privacy and they are making use of anything they give. And I am not happy with that privacy problem
Would be cool if they didnt track me. Would be sweet if I could use all the features on web browser without the app. So they didnt constantly track me and impede on my privacy. Would be cool if Facebook didnt own Instagram and werent a bunch of sell outs to big tech :)
"Review. I just post photos of nature of my state. We are in lockdown now so I   liked more photos of similar posts (about nature) than limits which I did not know about. Instagram restricted my comments to my own posts of nature and I can not write even the name of  a plant; I can not write the name of my place on the top, I can not write even 1 word under my followers post. The number of my followers (I did not have too many of them, I do not sell anything, I do not have ads or anything else) started to go down.Users of Instagram should have info what are limits per 1 day, I could not find them, I had to google them. Also these restrictions just slowly kill my account. I  asked for review, not too much changed. What if I will have my business in Instagram? What would happen to my customers, money, my obligation in such situation? I could not locate any info in settings or anywhere how to end instagrams restrictionsI am one of little internet ants who create billions for the biggest corporations. People like me, who are creators of your wealth and who create your jobs, should not be punished for such little imaginary  crimes"
"Privacy concern. Its a really good app but Im worried about my data because Instagram no longer asks for permission to track you in the iOS 14.5 App tracking transparency update. They used to ask, but after reinstalling the app, it longer does. If they have found a way around Apples ATT update, this is in violation of Apples App Store policy. Just be careful if privacy is your concern while using this app now. Otherwise its a good app but a bit messy. The app could be more easier to navigate"
Wow. I am currently unable to see the amount of followers or even what mutual friends we have in common thanks to this updates we didnt ask for . The message pops up every time i go to someones page about feed back it makes u not recognize whats going on on another persons page . How is this protecting my privacy ?? Limiting what we get to view on Instagram is a horrible idea
"Censorship. Instagram has been censoring many accounts which is an infringement of constitutional rights concerning freedom of speech that Americans have, as well as hindering important truthful information from being shared to others that could save lives and free us from this bogus mask wearing agenda instead of allowing doctors to come forward to speak of effective ways to treat  C O V I D 19 by using hydroxychloriquine. BTW C O V I D 19 really stands for certificate of vaccination ID (2019) which is a man made bioweapon sent out of China and that is why its often referred to as the China Virus. China has 2 million people in concentration camps. Their app tik tok is a spy tool. And they want to take over the world. Furthermore the use of 5G which is technology used for facial recognition causes Covid like symptoms and 5G posts are also being censored. 5G is a high speed technology that will be used to further spy on people hence the 6 feet apart rule. Deep state big tech owned companies Instagram Facebook Twitter YouTube are all acting like the Chinese Communist Government and censoring information in public forums. Hundreds of thousands of children go missing due to human trafficking and you censor people who put truth out about it. Shame on you. No doubt youll also censor this review. Just like the bogus fear mongering mainstream media youre pushing a false narrative  but in case you didnt know, in the end GOD WINS. The silent majority wins. Stop censoring accounts. It wont work anyway. Many already know the truth. Trump 2020"
STOP TRACKING OUR INFO. This App is tracking your every move. Instagram needs to stop. STOP WORKING WITH THE COMMUNIST. THE MEDIA IS THE VIRUS
"Beauty and Info. I started Instagram after I was a Facebook member. Instagram is my go to now because of the information I can find, when I didnt even know I was looking for it. I Love that I can connect with other members who have the same interests. For example, I can select follow people who have photographic interests in Africa and other parts of the world. Cooking, travel, Leonberger dogs are just a few of my interests.  Lastly, there are some sites that sell items and I have been able to for the most part purchase things that I want. I am no longer a Facebook member because Instagram is a more enjoyable experience for me"
"Censorship, human rights, privacy. Anti-human rights. Anti-people. Anti-oppressed. Sure, money, greed and power is what theyre about but we still should talk about this. Algorithm is set up to be biased to go along with the propaganda of the main media. Social media needs people to collect their profits and should allow people to post what happens around them without blockades. Human rights is a serious concern, especially going on now in Palestine. Facebook/Instagram only seems to care about what oppressors want"
"Users Private Information, DMs, etc, are not secure. instagram &amp; facebook deleted my accounts today w/o any communication.Ive never once violated TOS, nor have I even had an argument on either platformMy crime? I hold conservative values &amp; support the president. Its funny bc I only post photos of my woodworking projects on FB/instaHowever, I was stalked by a Facebook employee who was mad at my conservative twitter account. My Facebook account was magically hacked into shortly after. A few months later its been deleted for no reason. The left has become pathetically weak. Your personal information is not safe with these companies. Its Time we take them down a peg"
"Privacy. More privacy with my information please , and dont use mine camera ok"
"Serious privacy violation. Hi Apple,Why is this app still allowed on the app store? Who is there to protect our privacy and rights? How can instagram be allowed to gain access to our front camera, our microphone, our call logs, gps? Is enough not enough? Who will stand up to Facebook and their violations????? For everyone, please delete this app"
Data stealing and used for human mind manipulation. The cyber police and some peak level psychologists need to take a look at the Random algorithm on search button of Instagram .  Neo
"#StillTheBest. I love IG just how it is. And how we have the option to share to whoever and whenever with the simple privacy settings we have. I feel like it is the only app that still lets you keep your media public, but also personal..by not suggesting family or friends either.. lol. Thanks Instagram. I hope u stay the same."
"Racist and Discriminating app. Racism and national discrimination. Certain members of Instagram staff are using their positions to block, remove truthful comments and posts. On the other hand, they are approving posts and comments that give a message of violence, fake news, discrimination, abuse etc. that are not supported by any evidence. Clearly these are violations of freedom of speech. And supportive action towards racism, abuse, false information, privacy invasion"
"No Freedom of Speech. Facebook and Instagram are highly censored platforms and anti-American, and suppress freedom and information worldwide. They actively engage in partisan censorship and interfered in our elections. They are tech communists. They also believe they are the arbiters of truth. Parler is no better...they will be exposed in the future as well for privacy invasion"
Facebook is a surveillance company. They accessed your camera and mic without your knowledge and called it a bug.They sell your info to the highest bidder on a global scale for whatever uses deemed fit by the buyer.Delete this. These people are predators
"Privacy. I love apples new security features because it shows me when an app is actively using my camera.Instagram recently has been actively using my camera while scrolling through the feed, or in my chats. Thats just really unsettling knowing that the app is accessing my camera and could be saving or streaming that data somewhere while Im in app. Thats a no from me. Just revoked camera access from this app altogether. Hopefully its just a bug that gets fixed.iPhone 12 iOS 14.6"
Account hacked & photos used for ads. My account was hacked and my email address spammed.  Lost all my photos.    Then I learned that my photos were being sold for advertising without my permission. This is the world of Instagram-Facebook
"Needs some improvements/updates. I love IG and always have, but its a little behind as far as other social media apps. One example is the privacy it allows. I should be able to make my Followers and Following accounts lists completely private if I wanted - even to followers. Just because I let someone follow me doesnt mean I want them to see all accounts that follow me and the accounts I follow.  I really wish they would add this privacy feature"
"New update = no privacy. Yes they can see exactly what youre seeing on the app, they can even screenshot and screen record. They can also access ALL of your photos, your microphone, and your camera as long as the app is refreshing. If you dont care about your life and privacy, feel free to download and use Instagram as much as you want. Ill enjoy my human life without social media, experiencing the beauty of nature and distancing myself farther and farther from technology every day. As a reminder, please dont forget to go outside daily"
No privacy. Instagram deleting our post and hashtags for # as the give clear message that Instagram they do racism
"only useful for companies advertising and influencers. Instagram I would like to raise a few issues you have with your app. I strongly feel your recent algorithm changes to Instagram have change the app for the worse.It seems to be that Instagram will only favour your accounts photos and visibility based on how much you use the app- quite few hours a day, commenting on dozens of pictures and receiving comments on yours, that you need to be posting virtually every day, paying for promotions.. and if youre not on the app 24-7 your pictures will be penalised and chucked at the bottom of any # list. Im sure this is great for encouraging people to use the app more - as in companies, influencers and other high profile accounts that have professional people working on their accounts as a full time job, but for every average person-particularly artists that are trying their beat to gain exposure, this new algorithm makes it extremely hard. Dropping the chronological format of pictures on feeds makes it next to impossible for smaller accounts to gain any exposure unless they start treating Instagram as a full time job. Trying to force people into this position is quite ridiculous. Im not alone in saying Ive really been turned off using the app- because its just turning into a bombardment of privacy questioning adds and a place for professionals.It used to be about  connecting with people- friends as well as people with similar interests and a great place for creatives to show connect the world with their passions. I would love to see the app steer away for this letter box catalog and professional Instagramers type format and be more inclusive to everyone to allow everyone to be able to show and grow their accounts organically and still having a healthy life to social media balance- which is really important in this day and age"
"Facebook and Instagram No Customer Support. Account hacked.  They dont care. No phone, email or message support at all.  Nothing.  Terrible way to treat their customers. Yes users are customers that help to provide billions in revenue for them"
No privacy at all. the worst thing about instagram is that I cant stop unknown people from sending me message requests it caused me too much harassment and bullying. I had to deactivate it because of it I keep blocking them but they keep creating new accounts this is useless
"Privacy. Hi I have an issue with your current security practices on Instagram. I want a feature that will protect/hide my following/followers, as someone keeps harassing my friends and family, unfortunately, I block people and they just create another account and then start harassing people again. A social network was meant to be enjoyable, secure and fun, but this security issue will be Instagrams downfall as more people get harassed by some jealous ex, or someone who just has malicious intent to destroy friendships and business"
"Community guidelines - propaganda. Can&#39;t even share the governments official data, can&#39;t share your experience when it comes to vaccines or anything to do with globalist new world order agenda. In one word, this is a propaganda platform, where you will be able to see only their side of the story"
New Update. I have enjoyed my time using Instagram until the most recent update. Talk about invasion of privacy. NOBODY should have that much free access to my personal information
"Spying. I am really annoyed by the fact that Instagram is using the camera and the microphone of our devices to spy on us. I made tests over and over again to proof it. Many ads and recommendations are based on physical observation of my face, things that are very private and I would never search up on internet, less in Instagram. Ive been reporting images and videos that are very close to child and animal abuse and they keep feeding horrible stuff. Also whats the point of having a not interested botton if it doesnt work? Everyday I am rejecting shark themed videos and images but Instagram keeps pushing them like tyrants. Fed up I am of Instagram I just keep it for now to support an extinct language account , otherwise I would say bye bye forever to Instagram"
"Privacy and censorship issues. Same as Facebook who owns Instagram, we are facing privacy and ads issues not to mention the double standards policy of censorship Instagram is implemented especially against the Palestinians struggle Until that is fixed they will always get 1 star from me"
App tracks every thing you do. This app gives you no privacy including allowing hackers to take your account for themselves Use your name and pics for their scams Help your users Instagram
So much lost when FB took IG from us. I cant do it anymore. The latest change in terms clarifies how my data will be used to make decisions for me and to target me with advertising. I dont want an algorithm to decide what I see. I want to choose what I see
"Privacy NONE. Instagram listens to your mic, it also censors your posts. Its all controlled"
"New update. Instagram is changing their terms and conditions, making it legal for them track your location and see you through your camera. They will also be able to see things on other apps, including photos etc"
Instagrams restrictions are not unbiased. It would appear to me that Instagram(Facebook) has become intent on filtering information and putting fact checkers on every post in involving political or medical information. Yet you can go into the search bar and find hundreds of thousands of nude photographs of women. So the message is that its not ok to speak out against left wing ideology but its acceptable to post a picture of your breasts as long as you have a star over the nipples. I like Instagram and use it daily but stop trying to censor information and make it so sensitive people feel more comfortable. The world is an uncomfortable place so things like removing the amount of likes and making offensive comments invisible is just ridiculous
Instagram The best way to share your life. More image less talk. The best More image less words . And more privacy
"Creepy data collection. This app collects data, and recognizes when you make new account. This is predatory and dangerous because they hold onto data from years ago and it resurfaces when I rejoined instagram and I see accounts I followed 4 years ago on an old now deleted account being recommended. This is not okay by any means and for the sake of my privacy, I will no longer support this app or the parent company Facebook"
DATA. HEY Instagram why can I only follow a certain amount of people and like a certain amount of peoples post like that is horrible  I absolutely hate the new insta and I will personally not be using it anymore and Im sure many will not also .ill wait until a new better app comes out or maybe you should fix it
No privacy. Steals all your data - do not use the app
"Exploits users for marketing. The new update has a shopping tab at the bottom of the screen instead of the activity page. It messes with the usability of the app, and I will never buy anything off Instagram, especially after everyone I know who has, never received their product. The new terms of use allows Instagram to use our cameras to track our eye movements, which is a huge breach of privacy. All the protections outlined in the terms of use are for companies, not users"
Feed back. I love the app I just think we shouldnt need WiFi to post things or update things or to look at posts from out friends. Not all of us have data
Stalker app. Instagram does not protect your personal information - it uses it to silence and or manipulate you. Then it lies about doing so. The platform ads have taken over the content and there is a yet to be disclosed conversation/microphone surveillance feature that is present - based on the ads that show up after phone calls. UNSAFE They are in our homes cars and workplaces without our knowledgeOR consent
A BREACH OF PRIVACY. Will be uninstalling after Instagrams new DATA POLICY they can see all the pictures in your camera roll and can turn on your camera without you knowing this is a BREACH OF EVERYONES PRIVACY
Privacy. Instagram is awful at privacy setting and retrieving passwords. The newest updates makes the app worse Its harder to edit reels And you cant have sticker set to a certain time frame like you can for text WHAT
"Spy. This is a spyware product from mark again , I fully recommend you not to use Facebook,what&#39;s app,instagram and messengerIt&#39;s fully jewish products, and it actually designed to be a spyware tool on our privacy"
"Red Flag. Censoring of posts, consumer manipulation, giving up privacy to use app. Instagram is part of the problem"
"Race and national discrimination. There is huge violation of rights on Instagram. Employees can easily access your data, report it and block accounts just based on national discrimination. High management is aware of that and keep pretending nothing is wrong in their organization. This is situation where head is not aware about what hands are doing. Shame on Instagram"
"Spy tool. Instagram reads every message to make sure you are a good human, and then, like a bad human, sells your data and tracks your life. Oh, the irony"
"No privacy. Send a photo of anything to someone by WhatsApp, you will get ads about it in Instagram"
"Privacy at your workplace. If you care about your privacy then uninstall this app since your employer can ask them for your data during work hours. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp delete them or try not to use them during your work hours"
"Censorship. Instagram censors and silences marginalized groups and protects pedophile accounts, accounts that promote hatred and racism, and enforces the misogynistic ideals that womens bodies can only be sexualized by men sending inappropriate messages and images.The new TOS and blatant violation of peoples privacy and rights"
This is a social store. This isnt normal social media. Its a store that extracts as much data from you as possible. I was forced to hand over so much irrelevant personal data to create an account. Its ridiculous. Only making an account because social is a key part of my job
"This app is not that Great. Too much monitoring, too much limitations. Its even weird how Instagrams Privacy Practices are not even verified by Apple"
"Privacy concerns. This app has lost credibility with me because it is taking all your personal data, not only within the app but across all your app installed throughout your phone Also this is being heavily censored and the algorithms have been established for those whos speak truth to be censored beyond measure.  Be aware of all that is owned by Mark of the beast Zuckerberg whatsapp/Facebook/messenger and instagram"
"**MUST AVOID. Privacy infringements Auto adding to groups supporting Israel **. If the data they collect about you, from purchases interest hobbies health tracking communications, wasnt enough to dump this app altogether. Please take a look at the data they collect about you here in the App Store, you know that its all sold to 3rd parties, like corrupt governments under the false pretence of personalising ads.If you have a smart watch they even collect you health data, when you go to bed, when your blood pressure rises whilst checking websites, when you go out and where to and with whom, they read and sell the contents of your messages. They made matters worse by adding people without their permission to a group called Jerusalem prayer team labelled as a commercial group while in fact it claims that all followers support Israel criminal activities against all humanity.They now infringe on your views and force you to support groups whether you like it or not.Also sharing books that Facebook doesnt approve automatically get deleted without warning or explanations books about policies.Deleted 3 times from my page because they were against apartheid and racism.Facebook has become a racist supporting app.Zero privacy or respect to your freedom of speech and your personal views. An app that sells the contents of your messages to third party unauthorised parties.They also support and allow scammers to use their platform to sell rubbish and scam you out your money"
"Facebook 2.0. Remember when mindlessly scrolling through Instagram fun? Me neither. This app encourages toxic engagement from/between its users, is archaic in the way it sensors content through shadow bans, and helps perpetuate a global culture of staring at your phone. Not to mention have you read the terms you agree to when using the app? Again, neither but I can assume Ive given away most of my rights to any privacy/freedom whatsoever. TLDR: meta is a corporate monster, do not become their mindless slave"
"Boycott Facebook. Cant trust the back end-to-end encryptions between Facebooks platforms. Mark Zuckerburg has shown the world that he has little concern for the type of content that appears on his platform. He also shows us that he doesnt care if his platform has inaccurate or false information. He also doesnt care about your private data. In fact, Youre the commodity on Instagram. And lets be real, instagram is toxic. No one even posts real photos of themselves. Instagram causes body image issues, among many other troubling problems this company has; and I am deleting instagram today. I will be completely free of The Facebook Matrix in 2020. Join me"
Personal information. There is people all ways trying to leak out your information and when you ask the staff on here to help they do nothing about it thanks to that my information is being leaked
"Social, but lacks privacy. Its nice and social, more interesting and open to creativeness than Facebook. Other than that, its super obvious that their parent company, Facebook feeds the advertisement selection you receive; I can change what advertisements I receive on Instagram by changing what Im talking about in Facebook messenger. It uses your mic even when the phone is locked, again, tested by talking about topics that dont normally come up in daily conversation. At least I know how to manipulate the app so that I can find new online shops via advertisements?"
Too many privacy issues. Uninstalling because I dont trust Facebook owned products. They are all spyware. Please stop being evil. Thank you
"Censorship and privacy concerns. Anti-human rights. Anti-people. Anti-oppressed. Sure, money, greed and power is what theyre about but we still should talk about this. Algorithm is set up to be biased to go along with the propaganda of the main media. Social media needs people to collect their profits and should allow people to post what happens around them without blockades. Human rights is a serious concern, especially going on now in Palestine. Facebook/Instagram only seems to care about what oppressors want"
"Annoyed. Annoyed at how IG doesnt have features like TikTok or Facebook for that matter on being able to display and hide personal info. Such as followers / friends list, allow me to be able to make certain pictures or videos public or private, its either fully public or fully private let me choose what content or info I want to share"
"Stealing info. HelloStealing information is kind of bullying ,when I cant do anything about it I love instagram  so much But1- Because i was hurting from a  bad person that  He was trying to access to my account for several times And instagram couldnt stop him2_ The login activity was another city most of the time 3-the hackers tagged me on bad photos which its so hard Please Stop bullying and stealing on Instagram  It really hurts Even the hackers used my number and my email to  continue their bullying  which it was so hard to me for example sadly I couldnt receive emails from instagram but the hackers could receive them and they used them several times Another example is that the hackers used my number and they could receive sms from instagram but I couldnt Instagram lets simple and bad people hurt other people by  bullying and stealing on Instagram  Even they sent me a lot of fake emails with the name of instagram And they asked me to do odd things for changing password I received a lot of fake emails from instagram every dayI felt so bad I love instagram But  i love Safe instagram more  And now sadly I cant use it  Please make instagram a safe place for everyone"
"A wealth of information. Instagram is a great platform to discover an enormous amount of information. Lots of tips, sharing of info, reviews, great pictures, instant stories, etc. Keeping abreast of whats happening. Its my go to first thing in the morning with coffee in hand scanning all the posts around the world. "
Uses all your data and listens to your conversations for advertising. Love insta. But it uses all my data and sells it to other companies for marketing. I get lots of adds and weirdly brought most dont hit the Mark... unless it was a verbal conversation. They here and know all of those. Happy posting
"CENSORING ISSUE. Instagram has an incredible issue of censoring and deleting peoples posts, accounts and stories for raising awareness on severely important subjects. Accounts are censored from sharing the TRUTH from their accounts with fact checkers deleting even FACTUAL posts with legitimate sources.SORT YOUR CENSORING OUT INSTA"
Spying. I deleted it because Ive noticed that it used my camera even when I was not on it I know it did because the rest of the apps that use my camera is basically Snapchat and I closed the snap page and it was still there so I deleted the Instagram page and it disappeared please be safe apparently now theyre working for the government
"A terrible social media. Its always having issues, and I dont just mean the privacy concerns (seriously, they are breaking laws). They censor information they dont like, encourage hate in order to maximize usage and profit, and dont listen to their users. Save yourself time and get off this app"
Average social media. Toxic community over run by bots made to plague comment sections with scams or promotions of all kinds. Run by a bunch of clowns who priorities are all sorts of ruined. If you report a post of someone getting their head cut off youd die of old age before Instagram considers banning profiles who violate the code of conduct. Mark Suckerburg should of kept his filthy corporate hands off this platform. Facebook and Instagram now can invade your privacy
"Disgusting Company/App. Dont bother trying to make your own accounts for any hobbies you have, instagram will delete them for violating the guidelines when you have done absolutely nothing against the rules. Then they will try to extort a bunch of info from you if you want your account back. They also refuse to delete any racists content. I literally reported an account called ihate(n word)s and instagram says it doesnt go against their guidlines. But then they deleted my meme page because i followed/unfollowed to many people (the basic purpose of the app). Then they requested I send them a photo of my face with ID and a bunch of other info. Absolutely ridiculous that there isnt legal sanctions on running on app with this much influence like this. Pure trash"
"Disgusting. I no longer like the new Facebook policy, towards the users especially from a privacy standpoint,"
No privacy. This app is clearly infringing on our privacy rights and think that its okay to access other information on our phone and do whatever they want with our photos with their new terms and conditions. This app is straight up disrespecting us
"Ads everywhere. I used to enjoy Instagram and stay connect with friends but recently, I noticed the pattern, for every three photos on my newsfeeds, there is an add. Its absolutely disgusting what they did to this platform. I deleted my account today because I cant stand it anymore, aside from them selling your private information for money, they also torture you with all this ads that you cant get grid off"
Invasion of privacy. Meta and ig are the destruction of our world.. thanks
"Creepy new Terms & Conditions. The new terms & conditions coming out on December 20th is not only a gross overreach of our individual privacy but is also deeply concerning. Why would a social media platform EVER need that much information? For control? Again, gross. This is not ok and anyone else who thinks so needs to make their voice heard loud and clear"
Allows me to share personal things and market. 
"App Tracking WITHOUT PERMISSION. Apples s recent update allows you to tell an app not to track your activity outside the app. I opened Instagram after the update a while ago and was presented with the pop up to either allow or not allow the app to track me, I clicked ask app not to track. A few days later and even more recently I am seeing ads directly related to my search history on YouTube and google, Im also seeing ads directly related to my recent purchases on Amazon. The first couple times I thought maybe it was a coincidence but every time I open the app I see and ad related to something I recently searched or bought. To me this is a HUGE invasion of privacy ESPECIALLY since I specifically asked for the app not to track my activity outside of the app. Im noticing the same thing with ads on Facebook, not surprising since Facebook owns Instagram. I also went to the app tracking section of my settings and confirmed that tracking is turned off for both Facebook and Instagram. Its frustrating how little control we have of our privacy on the internet. Even with the new update its like companys like Facebook just dont care about the rules, they are directly violating the rules and its very angering. I wish there was more I could do than just leave a review but I know even if I could there would be nothing done about this EXTREME invasion of privacy"
"Privacy. If you care about privacy, dont use this"
Censoring information about Palestine. Censoring important information about what is happening in Palestine is not right. Instagram are siding with the colonisers and terrorists known as israel to continue killing innocent people and stealing land - and not allowing us to raise awareness to their crimes. Shame on all of you
"Spyware. Dont spend a dollar on advertising, most will be flagged as spam anyhow as Instagram refuses to follow iOS design patterns. App built to circumvent iOS privacy. Picks up keyboard tap locations and is a glorified keylogger. This is why theres a new update everyday- dancing around the iOS guidelines is the FB business model"
INSTAGRAM SYS ON US. Instagram is spying on us. For example if im talking to my mom about nails a nail add will pop up. Or if im talking about shoes a shoe add will pop up. They are listening to us
"Used to be fun, now just a time waster. I have been using Instagram for a long time now-all the way back to when it had the brown logo instead of the pink-purple ombré it has now- and I have become less and less happy with it over the years. It used to feel like a way to express myself and connect with others, personal and fun.        This first changed when they introduced a new algorithm to try and give the preferred posts first instead of just chronological. I noticed most people disliked this but Instagram failed to listen and kept their improvements.        The second change which made the app less personal and more cluttered was the introduction of ads in our personal feed. I feel like I am scrolling through the feed just trying to find my friends and familys posts. Now it is at its worst. I counted and every three posts (which usually arent even accounts Im close to) Instagram sandwiches in ads and sponsored content.      The overload of media and content in combination with these ads or suggested posts, makes the overall use of the app less focused and less enjoyable. Instead it feels like a complete waste of time instead of connecting with others like through other social media platforms such as snapchat- which they blatantly copied in the use of stories.       It is also hard to trust an app under the company of Facebook with privacy issues and one that is a growing monopoly.       Overall Instagram is no longer for the user. The user of the app is just a product. Our attention is being bought and sold and its apparent with the new layout having the shopping feature at the bottom and reels. The tabs we use the most often like notifications and the post button are squeezed into the corner to make more room for ads and shopping. This app no longer cares about the enjoyment of the user, it only cares about selling us stuff. And its even more obvious every time they update it and neglect to listen to the very people the app was designed for. In general, I have stopped using Instagram and have it deleted from my phone except to redownload and check dms from friends"
"They want access to your camera, texts and accounts. Dont get this app. They want access to way too much information. Look up the terms of service. It is frightening"
Going through private information. Instagram is supposed to be a private corporation and is not related to to safari or google in any way. It is obvious that they spy on us and get information from our search history or other sources to make their app better or wtvr . I find it very uncomfortable that multiple time Iv search stuff on google and it would appear in my activity page
"among the worse apps. instagram wants to get your information to sell it, not only that they are censoring everything the conservative post"
"I dont know where else to suggest things. Instagram is my most used social media, its great. Id just like to request that you might be able to scroll though your archived posts the same way you can your public posts. Itd be nice to scroll through your personal memories"
"Worse with every update. The latest update replaces the activity tab with a shopping tab and a reels tab. After a handful of recent posts, IG now says &#34;your all caught up&#34; and proceeds to display a mess of recommended posts instead of posts from the people you actually follow. Instead of being able to view the content of the people you care about, IG is forcing you to watch recycled TikTok videos, ads, and content to force your political views. I&#39;ve been using Instagram since 2013, and in the last couple years, each update makes IG more and more intolerable.Facebook- we know you&#39;re mining our data in the background. Why can&#39;t you at least have the decency to keep some semblance of what IG used to be"
"Censorship and privacy concern. Anti-human rights. Anti-people. Anti-oppressed. Sure, money, greed and power is what theyre about but we still should talk about this. Algorithm is set up to be biased to go along with the propaganda of the main media. Social media needs people to collect their profits and should allow people to post what happens around them without blockades. Human rights is a serious concern, especially going on now in Palestine. Facebook/Instagram only seems to care about what oppressors want"
"FIX THE REPORTING SYSTEM AND GET RID OF ALL THE SPAM. Okay, Ive been on Instagram since 2013, its a fun way to post pictures and keep up with friends and celebrities. There was a time when you could post pictures, post stories or look at comments without many issues. But recently things have gotten out of hand with spam/inappropriate pages and reporting. You cant post a story without seeing someone showing their bare Butt in their profile picture in your views, or you cant even scroll through your own or someone elses comment section without seeing these same pages spanning the comments. Yes you can just go private but not everyone wants to have to do that, what makes it worse is that you probably have young teens/kids on this app with public accounts and they probably see these pages pop up in their story views. You cant report them due to the fact that Instagrams reporting system is a joke. Anytime you report something you get a message back basically saying they cant get to it but they are going to assume it doesnt go against Guidelines. Instagram is quick to hiding comments with some swearing (I dont swear, this is just what Ive seen) but they wont do anything about naked people checking your profile or commenting random stuff on a page that has nothing to do with them. Then receiving over 100 likes on that comment from other spam/inappropriate accounts in less than 5 minutes. Instagram is just letting anything and everything on their app, its sad, it used to be great. A year or two ago this wouldve been a 4-5 star app. Now not so much"
"The data mining is ridiculous. I have recently been made aware of just how much information this app leeches from you. I get the app is free but I would much rather pay money to have a service that doesnt have all access to my phone. For example off the top of my head, they even monitor what kind of apps you have running in the background, and for how long, and your app switching patterns too. They have total access to your phone. They pry on too much information for my liking. Read the data policy yourself, please. You will see that they can see EVERY BIT of information on the usage of whichever device you use to access it. Its too much and we have to take this seriously"
"Spying. I cant stand how instagram spies on my other apps. Even when I have all privacy settings turned off for it.I was shopping for something, then 2 minutes later the EXACT same item shows up on instagram feed. "
No privacy. You let the government alienate Rights and writes and rites
Why my instagram not app data. Why my instagram not app data
Insights. I dont know about anyone else but Id definitely would like to be able to check insights on my private account I have a right to know whos saving my pictures and whos sending them to others
Illegally accessing data. They monitor your browser searches. All tracking and sharing options were turned off but I when I was searching on Safari for loans I havent searched for in years I started getting flooded with loan ads. Apple tracking options were also set to disabled so Instagram is bypassing what you give them access to and Apple is incapable of stopping it
"No Privacy, you are spied on. Imagine all your pictures and everything you say are kept as evidence against you one day"
Instagram is becoming FaceBook. The recent events have showed us that the zionist mark suckerberg is using his power by censoring the truth and fact checking anything that goes against the re written history for brainwashing people especially new generation. Calling the innocents terrorists and promoting the terrorists as peaceful humans. We all know that FaceBook google and literally 99% of social media are being monitored and stealing your data and that theyre owned by governments etc but seriously instagram? You really want to be part of the new world order so bad? Freedom of speech doesnt exist online anymore
"Worst Privacy and Tech support on the planet. I got hacked a couple days ago and have reached out to Instagram multiple times and have yet to hear back. Ive had friends and family report the account that I know is behind it as well as my personal account that was hacked because the person that has taken over my account has changed my email and phone number that was linked to my account so I cannot recover it. I have sent numerous screenshots from family and friends of this fraudulent activity and have still yet to hear back from anyone.All the meanwhile this person is constantly deleting my followers and hitting up my friends and family trying to get them to send their financial information. The person tried to hack my Facebook and WhatsApp but apparently Facebook and WhatsApp have better security measures then Instagram because I was able to stop them from doing that on my Facebook and WhatsApp yet Instagram still allowed them to take it over. Not only that, when Instagram did finally sent me an email that my account information has changed and gave me a link to secure my account it was already too late. Its funny how they have so many options to report fraudulent activity, bullying and other things but when you click the links to do it it takes you absolutely nowhere but to a fax and question page that does absolutely nothing for nobodyBut piss them off even further by having them run in circles. Instagram is a sub company of Facebook which is a multibillion dollar company, yet they dont have the resources and people to appropriately help individuals going through something as fraudulent activity on their accounts. Just a bunch of links that do nothing"
"Privacy, algorithm, layout. One of the key draws to Instagram was the easy to use layout. All the buttons look very large and gaudy, and it is increasingly hard to navigate. Additionally the removal of the section of people I follow like makes it feel less community based especially since the algorithm hides a lot of content now. Plus the new privacy policy is very invasive"
Invasive Predators. Facebook and Instagram are Invasive Democrat Based Predators.  Destroying the United States  Invading everyones privacy so the feeble minded can control the narrative.  Stealing out photos and location to better control us.  Facebook children only want their views that destroy the United States
No privacy. Instagram doesnt protect their users
"It USED to be fun. I deleted all of my social media accounts except for Instagram. For a while, it was fun... now between the stupid algorithm showing me the same few accounts (with large follower counts) while I never see updates from my loved ones. It feels commercial now. It used to be a place to share memories, a place for small businesses to grow, a place for artists... now it is mostly instahoes, racists and commercials.This app like all things was ruined when touched by Zuckerberg.   They have plenty staff to harass parents with private profiles sharing videos of their child dancing to the music playing in the grocery store for copyright issues but somehow when people are getting threats or accounts are posting pictures in blackface parodying the suffering of others, Instagram cant be bothered to intervene.  It is abundantly clear that their function was never about socializing it was never about staying in touch or exploring its about stealing your data and adding crappy businesses to to your friends list to sell their scam products and diarrhea teas.I look forward to someone, anyone creating a rival app where businesses arent invited.I will bake a cake and throw a parade when the Zuckerberg regime gets overthrown"
"INSTAGRAM IS DONE. Instagram (owned by Facebook) is deleting reviews that tell people the truth about their terms of service and how they get to spy on you from your camera.They use new features to get your attention so then they can continue spying on everything you do just for advertisements and investors but this time Instagram/Facebook is definitely gonna be the next MySpace.Time to head over to VERO and start posting on there for now because they protect your privacy. VERO is also ad-free, no algorithms (so that means you get to keep your chronological feed), no data mining and all the celebrities are getting on there. Even Madonna is on there too"
Location privacy. I have a privacy concern when it comes to location and search targeted interactions. I have NEVER given instagram access to my location and I cant even find it as something requesting use of location services in my settings. Im on an iPhone SE (2020) so I find it unacceptable that something is just using information on me without my express permission and my device is working properly. Please provide transparency with users in regards  to privacy settings within your app
"Major Issues. 4/13/2020:Fix the many serious privacy issues, including: Change Your contact _____ is on Instagram as @____ to One of your contacts is on Instagram as @____, like what Twitter does. Also create a post-scheduler like on YouTube7/19/2019:I am deleting this app until I have an option to hide my number of followers, number of accounts Im following, and (most importantly) number of likes on my posts. Why would I want my friends comparing those things to other people?4/10/2019:Please make a post scheduler like youtube has so you can set a post to automatically become public at a certain time in the future3/10/2019:Current issues:Make it easier to have a non-personal account (like a fashion page or something) completely private. All my friends keep finding out about the existence of my mom-personal accounts...Also make it possible to have your number or followers and following and number of likes and views on posts privateFacebook and Instagram are HORRIBLE if you care about your privacy Thanks Zuckerberg 1/20/2019:You should be able to mute someones stories from just your home feed (circle at the top and rectangle suggestion slides lower down)1/10/2019:My reviews keep getting mysteriously deleted. What a joke. Review: You should be able to make specific posts not visible to certain people. Also, I have multiple meme accounts that all died overnight recently. There must have been an algorithm change. I hope my likes, comments, story views, and everything else go back to normal soon. If they dont Ill have to delete the app for good. There are also privacy issues. I have never synced my contacts to any of my meme accounts, yet anyone who syncs their contacts sees one of my meme accounts with my name attached to it. I blame Mark Zuckerberg for all the privacy issues regarding Facebook and Instagram"
Dont use Instagram  Data breach just happened. They are stealing your data
Unethical unscrupulous spying on users. Same behaviour as Facebook Unethical unscrupulous data mining of user data without proper user consent
"No privacy?. Many other apps dont have nearly this amount of shared, tracked, and sold data. Kinda sus"
"Im Truly Grateful . Insta finally got rid of us spying on the activity of those we follow. Fellow users knowing which photos i liked, and whos photos i commented on, affected my personal user experience. Thanks for foreseeing this"
Personal info infiltrating. The way they get all of your info is wayyy too creepy insta is now face book 2.0
"IF YOU VALUE YOUR PRIVACY READ THE TERMS. As of dec 20th 2020 the new terms and conditions that your automatically accepted into by having the app completed invaded your privacy... watching through your camera ALL the time, having access to just about everything in your phone ( accounts , messages , phone calls , contacts, everything) you having the app means everything in your phone is theirs do yourself a favor and READ the terms... I deleted my app after this update sad so many people are sacrificing their personal privacy just to have an app"
Spies. Instagram is a monster devouring your personal information while removing all your rights to privacy. Do not at any cost download and use Instagram
Spying on users. Found out recently Instagram records people when using their app
"Spies on you. Facebook, Inc., needs to stop listening to my conversations and censoring conservatives"
"Unethical the whole way down. Instagram&#39;s relentless attempts to accumulate user information (identifiable user information at that), in addition to its deliberate and continuous restructuring to pigeonhole itself as nothing but a glorified ad farm instead of any sort of photo sharing app as superficially intended, means that there is virtually no benefit to using it. In fact, in terms of its impact and policies, it could be termed as actively detrimental. The most recent and perhaps one of the most unambiguously horrendous policy decision has been the restriction and suppression on posts discussing what is happening to Palestine. While the willingness to target people with eating disorders with adds and #sponsored posts about weight-loss scams and the blind eye that this service has turned to its impact on the self esteem of children have shown a blatant disrespect for its users, the callousness shown by finally drawing a line on such a topic cannot be understated.Instagram does not care about its users, not as human beings and not as account holders this service depends upon. Uninstalling this app can only be beneficial to your privacy, your dignity, your self-esteem, and your conscience"
Instagram tracks everything we do . If you dont mind people tracking your location or anything you do in your phone and getting all your information then yes download this app but be safe
New privacy policy - way too invasive. Read the new policy. Its literally dystopian future scary
"The information you see is the information they want you to see. Instagram has proved to be totally biased and 100% dependent on who pays them to silence or elevate certain voices. It is happening in the case of Palestine and Israel while palestinians who are trying to share live videos and pictures of the Genocide done by Israel to show the world are being silenced or are having their posts taken down. YOU CANNOT SILENCE THE TRUTH INSTAGRAM. People are not stupid. Also, to the reader of this review, if they are capable of doing this, imagine what else they do and the info that they hide or share with you in order to influence you to think a certain type of way. Disgusting"
"Info wars. I feel like Instagram is trying to hide certain posts and information from us. I was reading this post and Instagram removed it for false information when there was nothing false about it. What doesn&#39;t Instagram want us to know?? Either way, it&#39;s definitely unreliable"
"Security issues. I love the app, Ive been using Instagram since the app had first been released; since Facebook took over theres been way too many hackers trying to get into peoples accounts and I just find it to be such an issue. This needs to be fixed There needs to be an update or something that can be done, people are trusting their data and everything but issues like this continue to occur"
"Owned by Facebook. Being owned by facebook, they have the same lack of privacy settings and censorship towards things that dont fit their narrative stop giving these oligarchs more power by being a part of their system"
Instagram collected my data. I have recently speak with a friend to buy a new shoes and after 30 min i see the ad on insta about the same product that i was talking with my friend
"Instagram ruins stories with update. I predict in two years, Instagram will be what Facebook is...a social network that has lost real active users. Crazy restrictions, I think we privacy concerns ruins user experience you should probably keep working on it. I cant access my account anymore because Instagram thinks Ive been a victim of a phishing attack. No Instagram, I was just using a scheduling tool. Whos working in UX because every year you guys make this worse. Stop only looking at data and actually speak to users about their experience"
Facebook Phone number. Some guy use my phone number to log into his Facebook account and somehow he had info to access my Instagram I reported it but no one ever did anything about it
"Different uses for technology. Why can we track covid CDC factual information but not prostitution, child sex trafficking, or human tracking using the same technology?"
"Just my personal take. The scientists and engineers behind social media have done an INCREDIBLE job of learning what stimulates people. That knowledge is now leveraged to create as much interactivity on their individual platforms as humanly possible. I fear that tech has evolved far faster than humankind\'s ability to use it without ill effect. Social media has 100% improved communication technology and allowed people without a voice to have one. But it also enables hyper vocal minorities to have a disproportionality large impact. Sometimes for very good things, often for bad. This is because negativity drives reactions and reflexes in humans far more than positivity. SOME people can get past those reflexes, moderate their use and put the phone down. I am not one of them. I do not believe that instagram is healthy for the human mind or building healthy cognitive thought patterns"
"Dont know what happened. Because I refused to allow you to track me, now I cant view Instagram on my phone. I feel we should have a choice. This is unfair"
Time to find a new platform. collecting data. I think not. Ever since Facebook bought Instagram I do not trust them
"Forced invasion of privacy. So a lot of you may be wondering why Instagram completely messed up your ability to reshare posts and reels. Well, I figured it out. This is their way of forcing you to give the app access to your camera and microphone. I have never let Instagram have access to either one. Now I cant reshare if I dont give the app access to all my phones functions. This is unacceptable. I hope they change this soon because just like Facebook, it might be time to permanently delete IG as well"
"I said NO to tracking my activities. I have a private conversation on my iPhone messages app about sleeping pills.Guess what appears on my Instagram feed? An ad about sleeping pills. Did I search it in Instagram? NoDid I use other websites or apps to search about sleeping pills? NoAnother instance, my phone was on a table and I was having a verbal conversation about a particular restaurant. That also specific restaurant started appearing on my newsfeed without any searches done on my phone. Despite the setting being switched off for both Facebook, and Instagram, you still reading, listening and tracking our conversations/activities"
Fix this. Instagram/ Facebook help support is the worst. My account got hacked and they would not help me recover it. I had friends that passed away and were on my old account. Now i can never get any of the pictures we had and time we shared because the support team wont return my emails to try and reset my pw for my old account. All my data lost. We never realize just how important data is until life hits you hard and you cant take pictures with someone anymore
"Generally good app, extremely sketchy privacy policy. The Instagram app is good at what its designed to do, waste your time. Your time is essentially what you pay for the entertainment, because they get money from all the ads. That being said, Instagram is owned by Facebook and has a similarly sketchy privacy or piracy policy if you actually go and read it which they know most people will never do. Also, Im experiencing a bug with Resls where whenever I tap on one to watch it, it takes in excess of 3 seconds to load. This might not seem like a lot of time but it makes me less likely to open a reel knowing itll take a while to start playing (this is with a super fast internet connection too)"
"Instagram used to be amazing. Then Facebook let zuckerburg get his tentacles into and it has slowly been ruined like everything thing else he touches. Ads, changes to the algorithm bad TOS and selling your data. FB needs to go"
"Instagram app launch issue. When I open my Instagram app I keep getting a Terms and Data Policy prompt. It has never done that before and I dont know why it is doing it. It is actually quite bothersome and ID like to know what is going on with the app. Also, when I open new messages I cant scroll up through the previous messages, it just stays frozen and when I hit back and return to the inbox, the red dot notification does not disappear. This is the first time this has happened and the app is up to date. What is going on with the app right now?"
No freedom of speech or Privacy. whats the purpose of even have an Instagram page if they control what you say and or post? People are literally on there to share things and to have conversations while the app is not allowing you to do that unless its what they feel that you can say or show Which completely defeats the purpose of even being on there
"Horrifying, Disgusting Targeted Ads & Content. Update: PLEASE fire your product and ads teams. I have been receiving daily Instagram ads of various mental health disorders that I do not have. and there is no way for the user to regulate the ads at all. Its sickening and the entire team needs to be evaluated for sociopathy. My last review isnt present, likely due to an app update, but the issues with harassing targeted media still continue. Feed content is so disgusting after recent harassment from California & uc berkeley employees towards app users (very ugly, naked, pregnant, unappealing photos recommended by followed hashtags that have nothing to do with the hashtag). Employees are obviously abusing their work privileges to harass users. Its sad seeing the apps content quality degrade to this level. I also dont have the chronological feature that was announced in the news. Meta doesnt care about user privacy since they wont prevent messages and accounts from being hacked. There should be an option to opt out of being a Guinea pig in this social experiment"
Spying. They can see everything you do and they have all the rights to your personal information. They can access your front camera and mic
Insecure and manipulative. 1: This app is always snooping. Just now it automatically grabbed the image in my clipboard without asking me. It is not data I consented to share with Facebook2: Every other post is advertising something -- there\'s almost no real content anymore. It\'s just screenshots of TikTok and ads
"This app is not good for mental health. Not to mention they sell your data, they do a lot of censoring and all they care about is profit. Now theyre going to start advertising how good the Facebook is just so their image doesnt change. Facebook is just trash"
"Censorship is not part of a free society. Instagram have censored my account for months now for sharing peer reviewed, quantifiable data that goes against the current mainstream agenda. My business has been severely impacted by this censorship and account restriction. I have contacted Instagram 3 times regarding the matter and have not received a single response"
"Future update/new update. Instagram is a good app if you use it for work or to spread your business. That being said, its not good for if you want actual privacy especially with the update they want to do/have done. Its unconstitutional and wrong. Theyre silencing the truth and blindly leading you to believe in lies. If they do this update many people will leave Instagram. They deserve their privacy and Instagram should not have access to their personal information. Fix this and let people have their have their privacy and not shadow ban them for speaking the truth"
"Pictures /selfies. I love instagram, the only thing I dont like is the fact that people can steal your selfies to scam people I wish there were an app that could detect pictures of ours in other countries. It breaks my heart to know that this is going on and nothing is really done about it. When the elderly lose  their life savings to evil, lazy, greedy scammers. It really breaks my heart and Im mad about it. Yes I could go private but us influencers have messages and information to give Especially in my case, all I want is to stop animal abuse, cruelty, torture and neglect Maybe, installing an option to block certain countries from seeing our instagram page. Im just saying I just want the violence to stop and not be concerned that someone is hurting an innocent individual by taking all their money Have a nice day #bekindtoanimals"
"No humans will help you. Instagram sells your information and then has nobody that is available to help. Goodluck with using email to get ahold of customer support l. The fact that an actual human can not answer the phone and help me means i am left with my account hacked and deleted. I will be deleting Instagram, Facebook and any apps that work under this same company"
"Protection and Convenience. I feel like IG could do a lot more to protect its users from hacks and breaches of information.  Also, I hate it when it jumps in my feed from what I was reading then I can t find the post I was on.  I hate that.  Time for some updates guys"
Biased. Instagram has become more and more like facistbook. The 1930s nazi censorship and regulating is getting worse. Truth is not something they like posted on here and they have no problem invading your privacy to remove your contents
How how does this make sense?. My account was hacked about a month ago. Thats fine it happens not the apps fault. But when I make a new account Im told instagram wants 24 hours to review the personal information and after that 24 hours nothing. The account gets deactivated and I Cant get back in. So I get hacked and now my whole device isnt allowed on the servers is that how this works? Terrible customer service but what do we really expect? Its Facebook all they ever give you is an FAQ and big fat middle finger
"Social media. Instagram is the best apps to connect people around the world, great tool to express ideas, marketing component for personal brand and business. For me , it is my visual art diarys that help me to see how i grow in my art career. I enjoy to use this social media apps"
Terrible data mining conglomerate. Privacy is a thing of the past on this Facebook owned app. Done with this terribly invasive software
"As bad as Facebook. Promotes media bias, this app is as bad as Facebook in that it collects data &amp; targets advertising to users. #FreePalestine"
"Spy. This is good , but insta sell people-info to Other GOV"
Facebook and Instagram - zero personal or business support. My personal and business account were hacked and immediately closed by Facebook.    Money stolen from my Ad account - years of work gone in a second.   Zero support or remedy through Facebook and Instagram.  Help pages put you in a loop of nothing because you cant log on as you dont have access to account and you cant get help without an account.    Considering the amount of money I spent promoting my business I am disgusted with Facebook.  They destroy businesses and peoples income source.  If i could score negative I would
"No Privacy. Update: August 14, 2021 Why is this still not fixed and why havent the developers responded? Instagram should take privacy far more seriously. How many people are stalked, hurt or killed because of social media. I enjoy using Instagram but please make it more secure by allowing users to have better control over their privacy Original review: Why do my friends/followers have access to seeing my other friends? Facebook (which owns Instagram) allows the Facebook app to block your friends from seeing your other friends but Instagram does not and that makes no sense This is a massive privacy issue, please update the app and correct this issue. Thank you"
Data. I love Instagram but sometimes there are a lot of bugs. I also think that you definitely have enough data to tell us who the users are that send our posts around. Why add that feature if youre not gonna show us who sends the post around? Instagram to be so much better with this feature
Read the privacy rights. Another FB owned censored app. It used to be fun. Note they think they can control your life
Keep flagging my videos for false information. Its legitimately a dude getting so many flower necklaces it covers his body. How come it isnt easier to report a false false information flag? Dont want to deal with it ? Fix your helping to protect Instagram with no false information. You hire some dude who is reporting it and for more information its a fake website in Spanish with tons of red circles and arrows pointing to his flower necklaces. I get you sell our information but at least make the app usable if you want to keep using us for money
"Rights / Privacy (ish). idk bout anyone else but ik that there is prolly a lot of ppl who dont rlly care for some of the things that instagram changed. like we love the stickers &amp; the filters &amp; the dark mode &amp; some other things, but can we pls get back the chronological feed &amp; the rights to see who views our stories even after 24hrs  i miss being able to see who watches my stories cus it makes me feel more comfortable &amp; when u see the latest post, it doesnt get u confused on when it was actually postedi mainly wanted to see if we can get the option to see who watched our stories cus thats what i was mostly concerned bout. like i could not stress enough how much that would help. plus u would be able to see who saw ur story even after it expired cus then u would be able to find out who lurked ur page"
"Pivoting to video. What was once the main reason I got a smartphone has now become a husk of its former self. Likes and new posts were moved to the top right which is terrible as not only do I have to reach further now just to do what the app was designed around, but theres now also other things in that place, reels and shop, both things that are fine on their own but in my opinion should not be the primary focus of this app. Facebook seems to have the touch of death. Theyve bloated their own social network to the point where no one I know goes on it anymore besides our parents and grandparents. It now seems that Instagram is their portal to the youth, and theyre ruining the platform by trying to change it into their version of Tiktok. I dont use tiktok but I know a bunch of people who do, none of them are using Instagram reels except for, you guessed it, dumping their tiktoks onto the platform. The shopping feature is kind of cool. Only kind of. I think it would be great for stores to have stuff for sale but it is literally more prominently displayed than photos/videos/likes. Also, following brands doesnt mean I want shopping updates from those brands. Not being able to disable this really hurts the experience.I worry that if Instagram doesnt get it together soon, users will leave (for what I dont know), and Instagram will go the way of Facebook and just become a dump for content which was originally posted on another platform. I know my Facebook is the same way for pictures I post on Instagram"
instagram. I dont care for this app anymore because the company allows people to go into your account and get information and contact people you know and pretend they are you
"Be careful. Facebook tracks everything you do on phone: even notes you write, location, sites you visit"
"PLEASE RATE ONE STAR. PLEASE READ******* INSTAGRAM UPDATED THEIR NEW TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO, AND THEY ARE VIOLATING **ALL** OF YOUR PRIVACY. THEY HAVE YOUR CAMERA AND MIC ON AT ALL TIMES EVEN OFF OF THE APP, ACCESS ALL OF YOUR PHONE NUMBERS AND CONTACTS, TEXT MESSAGES, SEE ALL OF YOUR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS, CREDIT CARD INFO, ALL THE WEBSITES YOU VISIT, EVERYTHING YOU DO ON YOUR DEVICE. PLEASE RATE THIS ONE STAR. THIS IS SERIOUS"
Privacy. Deleted the app and account after years. Horrible company that only harvested information. Do not use this and especially dont put pictures of your kids on this
"Terrible. Absolutely terrible social media system. Whilst your browsing through its news feed, Instagram is going through all of your private data, emails, messages and anything else you have on your phone. It dictates what you can and cant look at/ speak about. Gives loads of misinformation through so called fact checkers which dont give you actual facts but gives you information which keeps their narrative going"
"Latest Terms & Conditions. I didnt realize using this app would give access to anyone at Instagram to have access to my ENTIRE PHONE, not just their app. Its extremely disheartening &amp; disappointing as a lot of us not only use instagram for personal use but business as well. Their latest release of their terms and conditions makes me sick to my stomach &amp; I never want to log on to their app again"
"privacy concern. the recent terms of use update allows them to be far too invasive. there is no reason for instagram to has access to my call logs and text messages. not to mention the resent update where they turned the whole app into a damn store. im deleting this app, they&#39;re running themselves into the dirt"
"What has Instagram become?. The algorithm is trash, the app has massively invaded privacy, stupid updates nobody asks for. This app has made me be paranoid if Im being recorded or manipulated on any Facebook owned products. This app was so simple and easy before Facebook took over. Now the app is just garbage. Done with the app, done with Facebook  Save yourself and avoid all Facebook products at all costs They cant be trusted"
Reason you need 2 get this app. 1.this app is the most socialized app ever you can make friends and get new followers just in a flash or a light bulb and connect  2.it lets yhu see who watches your story and who likes it which as if yhu have an ex and they come on your page you would not kno well this app will And for last 3.it will report the things you dont like and wont ever see it again for example if you see a picture of trump you can block report hack anything and it wont be up there anymore cause you hacked it or reported it so it can be deleted 
terms of use. i really dislike your terms of use. i have no privacy
Security and privacy concerns. 
Data Collection and censorship. This platform allows mass data collection and sensors free speech
"Instagram is quite the app. I usually dont review apps, especially social media related apps. Most of those apps being YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter. But in all honesty, I really like Instagram. And I dont mean like Ill use it an average amount of times per-day. I mean that Im on it almost 24/7, and the only time I get off of it. Is when Im in class, wanting to watch TV, or Im about to play Video Games. Instagram never fails to leave me guessing. One second Ill be scrolling through cute cat memes and then I scroll down one more and I see a girl wearing a bikini, thirst trapping me, and Im left confused and yet also amused at the sight. Now its not because of Instagrams algorithm, but because Im idiotic. And I decided literally anyone who follows me, Ill follow back And so when it comes to E-Girl Accounts, Thirst-Trap Accounts, and like Accounts fully dedicated to showing girls with cleavage, tight bikinis exposing everything but their, yknow, and Accounts that just all n all leave you wondering why in the world you would actually WANT to follow these accounts. Sometimes its overboard as well, theyll roll their eyes and put like Uwu as a caption. And sometimes theyll put their index fingers together and give the camera puppy dog eyes. Whilst being dressed in little to no clothing whatsoever and desperately trying to get likes to support their account. But not only does Instagram have A LOT of the things mentioned above. But it also has some of the easiest access to hacking on social media. I was targeted by a hacker the other day on Instagram and I filed a report for scam and fraud. But Ive yet to receive word that the account would be banned or terminated from Instagram Servers. But not only is it easy to hack into Instagram, not from personal experience but just from my friends description. And knowing a guy who can hack. But Instagram is a threat sometimes when it comes to IPhone giveaways, links, and all kinds of things you wouldnt expect to be dangerous.And from personal knowledge, NEVER, click a linkThats of course unless you know the person, and you can trust them. And you know they wouldnt screw you over.Never click on peoples mentions who say Youve won a free IPhone 13 Pro-Max or whatever they say. They are 100% ALWAYS scamsIf you are still reading this, thank you. Because this took an extreme amount of effort to write and reread back to ensure there were very few grammar errors or mistakes within the review. But thats not itInstagram is NOT only just a fun app to screw around on, scroll through funny videos on, and just generally have fun on But also a place to socialize, meet new friends, and have an all-and-all great time using I use Instagram THE most for texting people, and chatting with new people. So if anyone out there is looking for new friends Please download Instagram because thats what its pretty much designed for Thanks for Reading God Bless"
Stupid Updates. Instagram your updates are stupid. Your privacy policy is unconstitutional Spying on citizens isnt normal
"great app, bad management. the app itself is well designed, works well enough, etc, but I sure wish it wasnt collecting my information to sell without my permission. Like, the targeted ads are VERY aggressive. There have been multiple times that I speak about a specific food and the same day I get an ad for a store and that same food is in the ad photo/caption. You can turn off the microphone access, but then you cant post to your story (you can turn it off for snapchat and itll still work, just without sound). There are other things you can do for privacy, but that shouldnt be such a hassle; it should also be the companys responsibility. Theyve put out multiple statements about this but they just arent being transparent enough for me. Deleted it for peace of mind"
"Updates. Instagram used to be a great app to see your friends pictures and celebrity content. But with every update we are pushed further into an Instagram that nobody asked for. Our feeds are no longer in chronological order. We have reels that are not needed because Tik tok exists and a marketplace section that nobody requested. The interaction with pictures seems to be an after thought for Instagram and, it makes it difficult to use. Im no longer interested in uploading because no one can see it and the amount of ads stops me from scrolling. At this point I am waiting for a better app to come along so I can jump ship. Facebook have ruined this app"
"Why cant instagram have custom privacy options for each photo like Facebook?. I think this app would be so much better if stories had another option to make custom privacy groups. The same as the new close friends feature, but in addition you could make additional groups that you could select which stories were viewable by which people. For example, Id have close friends just friends and then everyone, including friends and work colleagues and family. It would not notify them that they are part of this group like close friends does, but more would be a quicker toggle to manually hiding / unhiding your story from people.  Theres often things I want to post as a regular story but have to go through and hide work colleagues from my story each time, if its something I dont want them to see This would be similar to custom privacy on Facebook - where you can post a photo and choose who can see it. This would be perfect for photos too - Id love to be able to post photos on my instagram that some are for just friends that are not suitable for colleagues / acquaintances, and some are for everyone to see, etc. Surely the popularity of people making private/ personal/ spam accounts alongside their main accounts shows that there is a demand for this, as they feel like they have content they dont want their whole normal following to see. Its inconvenient to have two accounts, and we should be able to toggle the privacy on our photos so that we have our own choice of who sees our content I feel like Instagram are way behind other social media on this front"
Too much invasion into privacy. Ig just changed their terms and policies and I have chosen to dump the app off my phone. I dont need to be tracked every second of every day
Privacy. Need proper privacy settings for users. No one needs to know who you follow
"Useless. Instagram is a useless app that has no value other than draining your personal information, spreading the communist narrative and giving power to the elite silicone valley oligarchs"
"Changed my life. Instagram opened up doors for me that other platforms are lacking. The possibilities are limitless when you know what to do, and how to execute data. Thanks Instagram. JB"
"Camera sometimes just turns on. This app is notorious for collecting data, not only that, but it just turns my camera on without my permission.  Its scary, why does facebook need pictures of me?"
"App Doesnt Load. Instagram doesnt load for me half the time on WiFi and on my unlimited data. Its very frustrating. Also, I dont appreciate scrolling through my feed and getting ads or suggestions on who to follow. I keep my following to a limited for a reason and I dont want to see random people on my timeline from data youre pulling from my phone. Its an invasion of privacy. Multiple reasons for me delete my account and app"
instagram. instagram will not let me use my data for when im not around wifi
"Wrongfully Deleted My Account. Instagram deleted my professional account, I lost over 10 years of contacts, photos, and videos. Instagram/Facebook do not offer live human support, so if your account gets disabled it triggers an automated response cycle - you have to pose holding a piece of paper with your handwritten account info on it and send it to them, only to get a response about following guidelines. I have never posted a photo or comment against guidelines. Like many professional and personal pages I have used apps to keep track of IG followers, its absolute overkill to disable and delete someones account for this. Social media companies offer no remorse or support to help users.Imagine having one of the largest companies in the world and offering no human to human support. Instagram/Facebook needs to work on building a better user experience and should only disable accounts for gross misuse like posting hate speech, bullying, and things of that nature"
Security. Ive had Instagram for a couple years and so far no problems. Then even felt I had been getting hacked back to back. For anyone thinking about downloading Instagram dont. Its easily hackable and strangers can easily get access to all your information
"Was better before Facebook got it. Ads ads ads.   Was way better before Facebook took over. If you have limited data, the only thing that loads is the ads.... in the feed and the stories.  I came to be inspired by photography and get bombarded with ads.  Basically cant tell this app from Facebook either.  Wish there was another photography app similar"
Privacy. Dear developer i love using instagram but it will be really cool if we can hide just followers but not the pictures we post.pleas give us this flexibility if possible
5 Star. Ive been using this app for 4 years Instagram in an app where you can text people far away from you and all you need is WiFi or service You can upload pictures and make your account private :) I highly recommend this app Hope you download it
"Based around ads, not user friendly. Instagram constantly changes our personal timelines algorithm. First making it so we see the posts with the most activity and miss our actual friends posts, filtering ads in every 3 pictures and now showing us older posts that we didnt ask to see instead of older posts. They make it harder and harder to see the posts you actually follow"
instagram. excellent application have full privacy 
"Profile information. Instagram overall is a good app I dont have many complaints. One complaint that I do have is the profile information, whenever I try to edit my bio or profile picture it wont let me saying Sorry we couldnt update your profile picture. Please confirm you have an internet connection and try again in a moment. I do have WI-FI everything is Good, this is really getting bothersome at this point. Also, I deleted and downloaded the app again but I still get the same phrase"
New terms and conditions. I am not happy with the new terms and conditions. Theyre absolutely disgusting and a complete violation of privacy. Why do I need to be recorded whilst using the app? Fix up instagram
Privacy for following and followers. Everything in instagram is amazing but i think the only change remaining is that there must be a privacy so no one can see who you following and who you followed by
"Da frick??. Ok, content is ok ish. Thats why Im giving it three stars. I guess its like a really warped version of our culture, but thats the be expected when there are so many people who dont actually care about other peoples feelings. Not everyone is like this, but a lot are, especially when they dont have to say something to another person face. Anyhow, the thing that really bothers me is the amount of information thats linked to me and/or used to track me. Really disturbing. Even more than TikTok, and the US almost sued them over the amount of information they were collecting... I know I sound like a crazy person, but look over their privacy practices down below the app specifications. Like really look at it, not just a glance. Scary... and I mean, Im 17 and used to being tracked all the time but thats just intense Thats why I took off two stars"
"Instagram used to be a good app. I agree with many others here on the recent updates They are not helpful, and some downright unhelpful Why in the world would you MOVE the post button??? I haven&#39;t been to the analytics, but now you can ONLY see the lat 30 days of data?? How is that helpful for understanding your trending I get the feeling ALL of the social media platforms have STOPPED listing to their customers and are out to make a quick buck"
"Instagram - more like scamandspam. Make 2021 the year you get rid of this app. With every update this platform stinks of Facebooks lust for money making and privacy concerns.I get an Advert every 3rd picture which is just terrible. I understand adverts are a way of making money so the platform is free, but the amount of pushing this app does is desperate. And its safe to say Ive never been influenced by any of the Adverts so I feel sorry for the thirsty girls who are paying to promote themselves so they can fake it until they make it.The amount of fake accounts has also become unbearable - often getting messages from spam accounts or being tagged in pictures by spam accounts. I had to stop following high profile accounts such as UFC and MotoGP so my account wouldnt get targeted, which worked but kind of defeats the object of following your interests.Then there are the catfish accounts, the Bitcoin scammers and the Forex scammers that are just unbearable. Apparently these accounts dont breach the community guidelines either so Facebook are offering another platform for people to rinse others of their cash. The options of reporting accounts have become very ambiguous as well, its as if the platform doesnt want you to report people these days.The App itself has become very annoying with false alerts. I have had 2 messages in my inbox for the last 2 months but there are not actually any messages in there. Theres been an update since but it didnt solve the issue. There has also been a change recently where you now get notifications of someone you may know, which is annoying as hell so all my alerts are turned off. I ditched Facebook and Twitter accounts because of how bad the platforms are, so Instagram has now become the most recent cut. The platform is a mess and I hope others use their head and get rid of it. The only way Id continue to use this platform is if I could turn off all suggestions, and hide my profile to stop the spammers"
"For what it is, its alright. The basis of the app, posting and sharing pictures presumably with your friends is fine, its just everything else thats the problem. For some reason theres a store now? Dont see why that was necessary. The ads are shoveled down your throat, not to mention that Instagram blatantly takes information from you to give you ads on what you might want. They arent even trying to hide it anymore, you can google an item you may be interested in and sure enough itll be an ad in your feed minutes later. Not to mention the app listens to you talk to give you ads, anyone can try this, just talk about something with the app open and watch it appear as an ad. You might think Im joking but many many times of my personal experience would beg to differ. Plenty of censorship on the app too, fact checkers they call them. Typically they just put it on posts that are controversial rather than things that can easily be proven true or false. Oh if you mention anywhere on your post about the virus it puts a tab link to information about it. I could look past the fact checkers and all that but the ads are really what get me, wayyy too many and wayyy too personal"
"A Privacy Policy that makes 1984 look tame. With that kind of Privacy Policy, only midwits would use Instagram"
No Privacy. Theres no privacy on this app anymore everyone can see everything who u follow when..come on guys
STOP. Stop selling our personal information Instagram our phones already listen to us and watch us why do this
How are you a billion dollar app with no customer service. Instagram is selling all your information and giving you nothing
Hmmm. Insta shouldnt listen but they do. Shouldnt steal ya info but they do. Shouldnt allow other big corp privy to you but they do. Shouldnt sell ya info but they do. Be careful what you allow on all your social media even if it seems small. The cloud keeps it forever
Bots and socialism. Instagram has a massive bot issue. Every comment section is filled with massive waves of bots and you cant read any real comments. They also sensor anything they dont agree with just like every other big time social media outlet and theres soooooo many ads. I remember when IG didnt have those annoying ads every 3 posts and they werent so greedy. But you know thats zuckerberg for ya ruining anything he touches and also recording your voice in daily life for personal ads. Talk about an invasion of privacy allow access to microphone should and only be for recording videos and not probing people
"Invasion of privacy. Their terms and conditions are a invasion of privacy, they record you, have access to ANYTHING you do on your phone, have access to call logs and more. Its unacceptable, and they can share all the information they gather from you with anyone. Basically have no right or privacy"
Instagram is interesting. No asking for personal information just posting what you feel comfortable sharing its great
Crap assistance. Useless help Crap removal of spam accounts And no help reporting dodgy accounts People being blackmailed. People having their pictures stolen and used to open fake spam bot fraud accounts.Instagram has photographic software that shows duplicated accounts. Stop people stealing and posting duplicated accounts from being used on other accounts without the pictures owners permission. Instagram has the worst reputation of all social media because you just allow fraud to happen
"Spies on you. Every time Ive mention how much I hate something, Instagram later shows me that exact thing in my feed.I never trusted Facebook but now Im losing faith in iOS and Apple"
"Bad privacy protection and dont fixing blocks problems. HiDearMr. Instagram if you cant protected for privacy of user or cant really of correct accounts and wants to lose our priorities, after much more to fix my problem in losing privacy, or cant fixed my Blocked situation after much more feedback s sent to you Confirm me that deleted my app and dont used me , my family and friends had so problems with you,.  Best regards"
"This app is snooping. Three reasons why Im confident Instagram is listening to my conversations even when it isnt being used and even though it has no permissions to use my mic:1. My wife and I were joking about whether I should order bras for her from my preferred online retailer (one she doesnt order from or have an account with). We were joking about how the order update emails would read (someone named John getting bra order/shipment email updates). The word bras must have been used 25 times tossing this joke back and forth. The next night I saw ads for bras in my IG feed.2. A friend of mine was saying that he changed Vitamin C supplements and  that they made him sick. Im talking about this he mentioned the brand, the vitamin, and the type (gummies). The brand, that vitamin (vitamin c) and gummies (vs pill form) was discussed maybe 5 minutes at most.  That night I saw ads for that VERY SAME brand, vitamin, and type (the gummies)  in my IG feed. I never use that brand, I dont shop or search for my supplements online and I dont use gummies. No reason for me to be targeted for that ad other than that conversation.3. I was talking with a neighbor on my porch. My son offered him some candy that he got at his birthday party. My neighbor asked if he had a specific candy, because that was the only one he really liked (Im omitting the brand and type here). The brand and type was mentioned probably a dozen times in the conversation.  The next day I saw ads for that very same candy. I never saw a candy ad before. I dont eat candy, search for it or shop for it, my son doesnt like chocolate, and my wife is diabetic and doesnt eat candy. So again there was no reason for me to be targeted for that ad other than the conversation I had with my neighbor.  After a year of this creepy business I deleted the app. IG and Facebook claim their apps dont listen to users conversations.  These are only 3 instances of many that have me suspicious and believing they are lying.  Bras (Im a manI dont wear, shop for, or search online stores for bras), vitamins I dont use and never do online searches or shopping for, and candy that no one in my household eats (we hardly eat candy at all).  Not coincidence. Beware.I know online advertising has ways of figuring you out and targeting you for particular ads, but there is no way I could have been targeted for these ads, other than for my conversations. No cookies online searches, video searches/play or remotely related consumer behavior.  Only by someone eavesdropping could I have been targeted for those ads. If Im wrong, Id like IG to respond to this review and explain to all of us, very thoroughly, how else this could have happened"
"Invasion of privacy / Doesnt let you see posts. This app listens to your private conversations, then feeds ads based on what you discuss on phone calls or text on other apps. They also changed their timeline settings and algorithm a couple years back and trashed the app. No longer see posts by the few accounts I follow and my followers dont see mine. They feed you what they think you want to see, instead of what you actually follow. Used to be great. Now its creepy and controlling. Terrible job IG"
"Not happy with the spying. I used to like using Instagram, it can be useful for my business. However, the amount of data collection the new update does is outrageous, disgusting, and should be illegal. They literally spy on everything we do now on our phones and most people are oblivious to it. Instagram, you should be thoroughly ashamed or just rename yourselves Big Brother"
Instagram is better without Facebook. Instagram was sustainable on its own. I intensively dislike the new privacy policies and strongly know it in me that our social life will not be respected the same as it was before they took over and began moving things out of place.Instagram wasnt broken until you tried fixing it
Instagram. Nice social media platform to share personal and business information
"Instagram will be irrelevant in 5 years because of Facebook. Im a visual artist and I started an art account back in 2019. I posted mostly video work. My account recently was disabled for violating their Community Guidelines even though I never posted any nudity, violence or anything even close to that. I never even showed off my body. They have been de-platforming countless artists because we supposedly go against their terms. While my art had suggestive content it didnt go against any of their terms. There is actual pornography on their site and they allow it to stay. They are entirely hypocritical. They allow far more laxity from celebrities and influencers. I grew my account to 7200 followers, which isnt astronomical, but it was a lot for me. Their appeal process doesnt work, they have no customer service and they dont care about our privacy. We are just a way for them to sell advertising. Its already incredibly difficult for artists to have their voices heard and get our work out into the world. Sometimes social media is really our only option. Instagram doesnt care about their users, but ironically its their users that enable them to have a billion dollar business. Its our data that gets sold that has made Mark Zuckerberg one of the richest people in the world. Great companies innovate, terribly managed insecure companies steal ideas. Facebook is a terribly managed insecure company. Instagram was so much better than Facebook, so they destroyed it. They stole Stories from Snapchat, IGTV from YouTube and now Reels from TikTok. They only care about domination, but you cant dominate when everyone leaves. I hope that the FTC Antitrust lawsuits are successful"
"COVID Censorship, sexual solicitation & privacy. Love this platform except for how they are choosing to handle COVID-19 by censoring and water marking content. It is bias in my opinion, agenda based and journalistically unethical. It bothers me that their system can detect words like COVID and Automatically add a caption to that content but for some reason it cant stop all the fake accounts soliciting sex and harassing me everyday by watching my story. If the system can detect code words, some of those accounts should never be allowed to be created in the first place. I also recently started adding videos to my IGTV and Instagram locked me out of my account for suspicious activity. I feel extremely violated that instead of asking to confirm my account with the email address on file it forced me as an only option to give out my personal phone number for a verification code. I felt violated and pressed against the wall. These companies force our information out of us just to sell it and find out more information about their demographic. Now I have to deal with the spam as a result. The new algorithm (past 3 years) also needs some tweaking as well. It would be nice if IG didnt choose the content I see for me based on my activity as if i am incapable of following the people i chose to follow. Love the video and photo capabilities. The editing, the sharing. I love Instagram but if it wants a voice as it seems to now , Im hoping it develops more journalistic integrity and offers a less intrusive ways to verify suspicions activity"
Protection. I like the app but it needs to protect the users.  I have had people stolen my picture and profile here and used it elsewhere
"Rotten to the Core. Instagram/FB manipulate algorithms seems like on a day to day basis creating much discontinuity on my thread plus giving me undesirable, irrelevant content. Censorship and quelching of opinion/fact is rampant as Insta continues to \fact check\ well known important \virus\ data that is denied publication because it challenges and quashes political narratives. Insta has removed content of mine without notifying me if its removal. The days of Instagram as we once knew it are over and Zuckerberg is through. Furthermore, the algorithms or \spying\ and manipulation of threads are being micro-managed to such an extent all the fun, diversity and interest has been  obliterated. I have adverts almost every 3 photos and there is rarely any interesting dialog going on. Overall, not worth the effort unless you don\'t mind being a mindless robot scrolling through uneventful photos. Mindless repetition and censorship is the order of the day perfectly mirroring our current catastrophic political climate. Just say no to FB and Insta"
Breach of your privacy. The Instagram check and choose the videos uploaded? And take the videos off base on their political standard of small group of the people in the world
"2021. 1.  Why is the ig having Facebook messenger?  I dont like it. Ig should set its own business, not depending on facebooks money.  Sure im happy to pay $20 a year for this app. 2.  Where is the share story button?  Its gone. I like to share information with anyone in my 24 hours story.  That makes me wondering if there is something going on that leads me to do my homework and research this. 3.  Wow. I just read the privacy and datas. IG users,  facebook knows you.4. Oh and why is igs data usage so high?  Its like 12-13 gb. This ig features are a lot lot less than facebook features that has so low memory for data usage. I loved 2012 instagram with the polariod icon looking. Come back please. Ditch facebook. :)"
"Also Instagram. Well and now also Instagram, very nice to know Instagram using the camera phone  also when the app is off and is unbelievable to listen this problem was only a innocent bug,  but I just can&#39;t understand why every bug is always in your favor and against user privacy, nice job Mark Zuckerberg, from today I will stop to use the App for ever and also Facebook, when you will learn to respect the privacy of the people I will use again your apps. Goodbye"
Invasion of privacy. I dont like how you guys invade my privacy . This should be a platform for those who want to show certain things not for you to look inside our lives . thank you
Hackers Beware. I cant tell you how many people I know that have been recently hacked on Instagram and once they get in they access your Facebook have all of your information and your phone number. Be  careful  what you open everyone. They pose as a friend that needs help. Then they try to get you to purchase $500 in bitcoin
"Spies on you. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook Corp. purchased Instagram to add to their advertising machine. Products that a friend of mine texted me showed up as filtered ads for my account immediately after. Similarly, things I have said appear as ads not more than 15 minutes later. Avoid IG at ALL COSTS unless you dont care about your privacy"
R.I.P. Facebook has ruined Instagram.  This app now owned by Facebook collects enough data on you to find you on a crowded street
Requesting too much access. Im annoyed that I now need to give the app access to my camera and microphone just to share a post to my story. Instagram does not need access to either one of those for me to share someone elses post. I wish they would consider users privacy in the app and only request access for whats absolutely necessary
"New terms of service violate privacy. Watch a informative video on YouTube from JP Sears outlining Instagrams new terms of service, everything from access and ownership of your private text messages and access to your camera and private information on all devices and computers linked to your account. Absolutely unjust. Am thinking of deleting my account in light of these terms"
Instagram. Easiest app to use to keep photos and data
I am deleting my account. In protest of your new terms of service. I will not allow instagram to view my personal content or use my posted content for any reason. I hope your continuous disregard for personal privacy and content rights drives you as bankrupt fiscally as you are morally
"Used to be better. When it wasnt full of censorship and we could use common sense and our personal discretion, it was better. Those fact checkers are insanely inapropriate and random. They dont help small businesses get noticed anymore and ask them to pay. The greed and dictatorship is real at Instagram. People are slowly moving away as they feel IG is now unreliable and unsafe to build a following on"
"My account Was hacked and no one helped. MY ACOIUNT WAS HACKED. My privacy was spilled out so everyone can see. Its scary and Instagram is the worst ever. I will delete everything associated with META, theyre the worst. They dont care about ur privacy"
Hmmm . In the past week or so and Instagram has been giving me a lot of technical difficulties starting off I cannot like any photos they tell me that I need to report this action also when I go to follow my personal family members it will not allow me to follow them Im not sure why
"Exactly what you expect from facebook. They dont actually care about the app being good. All they want is to sell your data and show you ads. Want an indication of how little they care? There has, for approximately one YEAR, been a bug where changing the volume of a video mutes it. Every. Time. Just go out and touch grass, this app isnt worth your sanity"
"Constant restrictions. My account receives constant feature restrictions with no explanation. I cant reshare to story, I cant report problems with the apps inbuilt help option, my posts wont upload. All the data that Facebook farms from its users and it cant even give them decent services. Becoming a bit ridiculous"
"Spy & unfair. Unfair Social Media, they delete some posts and keep another because of political reasons  Furthermore they are a spy, collect your information and share it with some of governments as well for marketing purposes"
"It watches everything. Sadly, insta is owned by FB.. meaning its watching everything.. even activity outside the app.. your interactions with other apps on your phone, location, pics.. the lot.. its a great app, but super invasive"
Personal Information Stealing App. Screw Facebook for ruining this app. All it does now is steal personal info just like Big Brother in 1984
Instagram. The FBI or whoever watches us through Instagram and I dont think thats fair at all. Yall are way too nosey and dont want people to invade your privacy like so why do it to us. I know why because yall are weirdos who do corrupt stuff behind closed doors but when you all are called out for it you guys play dumb. We will never actually be free or treated equally because thats not really what people want
"Needs separate feeds. I would enjoy using the app more if I could group the accounts I follow into separate feeds. For example, itd be great to group personal friends who id want to see every post vs. grouping maybe business accounts, or celebrities, or accounts by location.  A lot of times Ill open instagram only to be so overwhelmed by the amount of posts to go through, I just close it. Id really love to be able to focus energy on specific groups at specific times. Thank you"
"Rampant censorship and privacy issues. Ive used Instagram since 2012, and by and large have enjoyed it, up until late 2019-2020. Tons of censorship and privacy concerns, too many irrelevant ads. I dumped Facebook in 2016 and IG isnt far behind"
This new update is a disgusting invasion of privacy. Although Im not exactly shocked Instagram is doing this because all the freaks whose lives revolve around this app will continue to use it. As a mere civilian this is unnecessary and overboard. I just want to keep up with my friends and send them funny memes. Instagram I didnt sign up for this and if you intend on taking this much data from us you better pay us to extract our data and sell it
Data mining. Instagram can look through your camera everytime you open it and collect all your data. No one can see your posts either because the algorithim is so bad. This app is evil
My opinion. Instagram is A good at it connects me and my friends went cant see each other we can see your post you know like on iMessages we cant really do that we can like post. I think if we didnt need to use your data or Wi-Fi it would be much better
"What gives, Apple?. Why is it that I can turn off location services on my iPhone setting for every app except Instagram?   Why does Apple allow this for this app, but for no others?   My guess is Instagram is taking all of our browsing data (and more) and giving some back to Apple in return for free access everything on our iPhones - including things that we have told iPhone not to collect.  Until this situation is remedied and I can block Instagrams access, I am deleting this app.  Shame on you Apple, youre complicit in Zuckerbergs destruction of American democracy"
App on data. I love Instagram but hate that it never loads while on cellular data. Im on an unlimited plan (Verizon) and have installed and uninstalled this app numerous times to see if that helps with loading issues but never seems to do the trick. Nonetheless this app is amazing
Protection. IG need to have privacy settings on who you are following and what posts you like
"Concern. Im not sure why location is an optional field, if there is a security risk on your website. You could potentially compromise the safety of many people. Now that internet security is brought into attention in the youth, they are not unwise unaware of data thieves. Instagram should not be connected to Facebook at ALL. Time and time again the owners of Facebook have proven that they cannot be trusted in court"
Why are we being forced to give our private phone numbers. It seems a breach of privacy that Instagram is now demanding the data collection of cell numbers in order to use the app. The app will not work without giving a cell number This is a breach of personal privacy
Privacy. Dont take my information
Rewrite and pre write. Love how with Instagram you can rewrite and take control of your what you want just close people see by posting on your story or post it widely using other forms to share photos its all about privacy for me 
"Privacy Concerns??? and trashy updates. This app is just going downhill. Each update just gets worse and worse, trying to conform to trends its just annoying keep insta how it is Also, the new privacy policy is VERY concerning. Almost stalkerish, I have deleted the app and my account because of this.. Too far"
"Facebook ruined Instagram. Title says it all. Before FB bought IG it was ad free, was easier to navigate and post, and even somewhat respected your privacy. The last terms of use update made me nearly delete Instagram altogether, which Ive had for 8 years now. FB wants to track where you are, what youre doing, which posts you look at (forget like), how strong your internet connectivity is, what you can and cannot say, kill you with ads, and gather as much data as possible including using the facial recognition system on your phone. Dear FB, youve ruined IG, bugger off"
"If I wanted to Shop Id do that. In a world where youre constantly bombarded with advertisements , that feel overly personal. I cant seem to figure out why Instagram needed to update the app and kill the social media aspect. It has already become harder to see content on Instagram but this doesnt seem to be very useful for consumers as much as it would be for business"
No privacy. YOU LOSE ALL YOUR RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH FROM THE USER AGREEMENT.. i will not support this app or its developers ever again and i will recommend everyone i meet to delete
"For a social media app, its tolerable. It would be nice for the app not to crash and delete what Im typing in a story from time to time. Or for it not to suggest people from my past I rather forget because it managed to creep up on my personal data despite my attempts at preventing it from doing so in Settings. But it is a social media app after all, so heres my main issue: Why is it so far from intuitive when trying to find posts I liked? Why does it take so many taps (including a Google search) just to find that one video I liked from yesterday? Why is it NOT under Your Activity? Why is it quicker and easier to access the Shopping Bag for a social media app but not a Posts Youve Liked when the entire app is based on Liking posts? I mean if youre gonna creep up on my private data, at least make it easy for me to find that one cat video I wanted to share"
Instagram can do so much better then this. I wish we could choose the privacy of who can see our future posts just like Facebook
Privacy. You should put more privacy to your followers and the people you follow back I hope you consider this and make it for the next update please and thank you
"Stop violating our privacy. Look, we all love this platform to connect with people and explore, but your new terms and conditions have gone TOO FAR. Its invidious to be tracking your users, accessing their cameras, photos, and contacts. This is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. This is supposed to be a public platform, not a slimy way for tech companies to manipulate us and make an insane amount of money.You have the duty to be an ethical leader in the tech world. Uphold this honorable responsibility and stop abusing your power. Put human rights and privacy before greed. Our attention is the commodity that companies pay for... fine but you have taken this WAY too far.Dont be surprised if your app ratings go down for this exact reason"
Ads. Why are video ads playing on my insta wasting my data. Should be able to disable ad videos. I dont mind wasting my data on people I follow but not ads. I almost considered this stealing
"Takes side of sexual abusers who use Instagram to stalk girls. Cant wait for Apple to ban Instagram and other invasive apps from iOS store so we can enjoy private and secure respectful apps that the Apple will create Ill jump over to any platforms Apple comes up with any day, granted that they get the approval of true privacy"
"Make Instagram as good as it used to be. Absolutely nothing has changed. I get ads after every third post. You&#39;re not even free anymore, you&#39;re just spying on people at this point. What is your privacy policy anyway? 1. Just an awful layout. Give users the option to: A. Turn on and off stories B. Pay for an ad-free option C. See posts in chronological order D. An app alternative for a simpler old-school Instagram that everyone actually loved"
Not satisfied. One of my accounts got hacked and I have no control over it. I reported it to IG and there response was they do not see anything that goes against their policy. What about my personal concerns?  My family photos and such are on my page and I cant do anything about it. The hacker is reaching out to my followers attempting to proposition them for money and thats not my character. IG needs to have better privacy policies to include page recovery protocols
Instagram an un private media. Please stop recording my screen while your app is open in the background. I should not have to close an app every-time when Im done using it; due to the fact you are collecting any of my data and selling it to advertisers. This is no way to go about using technology and social media
"Extra options when reporting an account/conversation. I have been messaged a few times by profiles that have either been hacked or are intentionally made to try and gain access to your account they offer to send money to you either through Cashapp or any other apps like Cashapp I reported it but The choices were vague at best I think it would be better if once you chose the reason you are reporting them, you should be able to write/type out the reason for your claim and what they are asking you to do as well as you can send pictures of the messages and the links they ask you to either click on or send to them. I think this would help Instagram out to protect its users"
IG . I enjoy using Instagram for the respect and privacy of the page as mine is in. Keep up the good work everyone
All about business & ads No privacy . Be careful about the information you share
Misleading information. Very controlling on what information gets out and can be very misleading to the public
new privacy update. its just disgusting that they are looking through our stuff
Facebook ruins everything it touches. Instagram turned in to an extremely bloated platform with a lot of half baked ideas that ultimately make it ugly and unfriendly to use. Not to mention the fact that it is basically just an advertising site now. I follow around 1200 people but I found a setting that tells you who youre most likely to see on your timeline and it is 50 users who I do not care about but happen to promote products and sell things
"Cant post. So I get that Instagram parent company, Facebook, gives zero ducks about user privacy, but what about the ability to even post?See, Apple protects users from potentially malicious apps by allowing users to only select the photos they want to share rather than letting an app root around in all of their private life details. When the feature came out, IG adapted to it.Fast forward to now and IG no longer prompts the user to select more photos. I could repost one of a dozen or so photos from a month ago, but no new content is possible.Thanks, Zuck"
"Instagram Kidnapped my Account w no Explanation. Its actually Zero Stars but whats the difference? In any case. Instagram Kidnapped my digital life and Ppl think Ive disappeared. First it said there was unusual activity and they wanted to verify it was me. I followed the prompts and was soon after logged out. It said they would communicate (in some Matter) within 24 hours. Nothing happened. I tried logging in the next day and it then said Im not found I basically dont exist.. the feeling is horrific. Was I hacked? What happens if someone deleted my account? After hours of trying to find a way to reach out to them to find out whats going on, I was told I was deactivated because of a violation. Nothing else was explained. Ive been writing for 4 days asking for more information and letting them know there must be a mistake for a few reasons: - There is a self check section to view violations and nothing was there. - My account is private - I dont post anything on my page - I share stories but as a private account they are true to me and my circle and a difference of points of views on a telecommunications platform SHOULD BE PROTECTED and in the least not used to justify abrupt actions without a warning or proper FACTUAL communication as it operates in THE UNITED STATES. This started off as Unusual Activity and now its A Deactivation. The implications of abruptly deleting people are high. They say they want to do better w the mental health impact on its consumers from the usage of this TELE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY yet they have the power and indiscriminately Digitally Incapacitate and delete you w ZERO real way to communicate w them when a mistake has been made or information on what transpired. Basically condemning w no oversight. On what grounds do you deactivate someone for their Communication Device? Because youre a private company? Well, so is Verizon, for example and they dont get to delete your number and close your account because they dont agree w the words used on their service? There is oversight unlike w Meta. And I fear the lack of accountability from this companies actions will continue to measurably lead to mental instability in not just kids (cutting ppl off amongst their peers, cutting off your 360 of communication, as its your hub - while stealing your data when they deny you access to it) - to the even more extreme isolation within the adult population. No, starting a new account is not the answer. Stop pretending this is entertainment when you own 3/4 of the worlds communication platforms. Have them crash for a week w zero access and see what happens. Chaos. Ive been trying to get my account back up, to zero avail. Ppls lives should be a priority. You literally kidnapped my digital life and theres no random as to what do you want? Ive provided email, emails, text, and more, and nothing. This is unacceptable"
"Followers/Unfollowers. It would be nice to let us know who unfollowed us, when we used another app we get blocked. And Ig isnt letting you see who watched your stories after 24 hours. Thats our data, youre keeping our data from us. Im deleting my account"
"they literally control you. i hate this app so much, with every new update it gets more and more terrible. the new algorithm is beyond terrible, instagram STEALS your privacy and if you dont like it? guess what, you cant do much about. its so addictive. they changed all the features and its beyond HORRIBLE and annoying to use. the only reason i still use it is to run a fan page and chat with my close friends. thats it. i hate it so much i dont recommend trying it out. its not good for you. "
Im am deleting my account. With the new privacy updates I am deliting my Instagram and Facebook accounts. We have no privacy anymore
"Private. In Instagram, privacy is severely compromised. The directory can be easily disturbed. Even access to the virtues should be restricted"
"Love the app, hate the privacy. Instagram has probably always been tied for my fav social media with YouTube, and its always adding cool new features, but theres no version without ads. And with that you just have to accept all their trackers and data collectors for ads"
Not good at all. The app itself is fine the user data practices are shameful. Classic Facebook
Insta Results. Instagram is a great social media tool for promoting personal business information and promotions
Corrupt Company. Facebook and Instagram (same parent company) have violated the customer/product agreement by going back on their promise of free public speech open platform by censoring those with differing political and social and religious viewpoints. This is a violation of their contract agreement. I find this to be very poor customer service and I no longer want to use their product. They arent needed so Im deleting my account for the protection of my privacy and my right to use free speech according to constitutional authority
"Locked Me Out of My Account. Instagram gets 3 stars because Im very disappointed in the way its being run and eventually heading in the future. First, I woke up one morning to my account frozen because of security problems it had me put in my #, so I did, but the text never came, neither did email. So I try to contact this billion dollar, mega social media enterprise for help and they dont even have a support line?? Very unprofessional and appalling honestly. Now to their future: the app is no longer fun or interesting or even about its users, in fact, the algorithm now restricts your friends and family with lower follower counts and instead heavily boosts influencers, E commerce and propaganda. They took the account notification tab and made it harder to find while replacing it with online shopping (also Instagram, the stores you promote are not good quality and half on them steal from us)And finally, the purpose of Instagram is to share my pictures with an audience, you have restricted that and are now stealing all your ideas from other apps aka: stories from Snapchat and reels from ticktock. Trash company ever since zuckerberg got his filthy hands on it. Truly disappointing"
"False Info. I love the instagram app and honestly have no problem finding my way around it. The only thing is that false information gets spread around too much and I feel like Instagram should add a fact check to the majority of them. Don&#39;t get me wrong, obviously it&#39;s social media.. false news will spread around no matter what. And I do know that Instagram already have this feature (which is what makes it great) on certain posts, especially those that involve COVID. But with all the civil battles going on in society (speaking from personal experience, I&#39;ve had racial issues due to falso info being posted around) I feel like it would be quite helpful to put a warning or add some more fact checks specifically to political posts"
"Keeps getting worse. The worst part about Instagram these days is the moderators. For starters they dont have even the most basic grasp on how fair use works. And that doesnt really matter anyway, because its my job to make sure Im safe and dont violate the law.  Not theirs. Especially when I know clearly know the law regarding fair use better than they do. Then theres the fact that they violate their own terms. They cover articles that tell the truth about Democrats crimes. But they dont cover articles that lie about statistics. They refuse to remove posts that are clearly hate speech against conservatives. They refuse to remove comments that directly threaten violence against conservatives. They refuse to remove posts or pages supporting terrorist organizations. Or the pages actually owned by those terrorist organizations. They refuse to remove posts or pages of people selling or using narcotics. And that one is not only against their guidelines, but its against multiple state and federal laws"
"They allow prostitution and pedophilia. Instagram fact checks posts that dont agree with their point of view/opinion. But they allow underage girls to sell pictures of themselves and the reasoning is that they might express themselves differently. So when someone posts a viewpoint thats differing, they dont follow this ideology; but when its a 13 year old selling naked photos they think they should be able to express themselves. Really silly and backwards minded thinking. Not a fan of this app anymore whatsoever"
Personal information. I cannot get back into my Instagram account. Every time when I try I will get this pop Up and It will Say ERROR please wait a few minutes before You Try Again. Im tired of it I have personal business and information in There
Not good. Im keeping get locked out my account lots think Instagram is shocking locking people out there accounts for no reason at all and ask for your phone number can you not get any privacy on it at all can be dangerous people get your phone number Im not happy at all with Instagram needs lots work on it
Instagram. I love Instagram and in fact my business relies on Instagram. They made a lot of changes to their community guidelines and etc. making it harder for entrepreneurs to gain followers and etc. a lot of apps dont go hand to hand with Instagram like ones that track your followers and who unfollowed you. I wish they had apps of there own to help us manage our pages. Using outside apps can risk you losing your account and who wants that. People do and can make a living off Instagram. I know they know that and wish they did more to help
"Posts/Feed. The new update is terrible. All the posts run together. It's hard to distinguish where one poata ends and the next begins. The intent is to focus eyes on sponsored ads and other unsolicited posts. I have significantly cut my time on IG back. I no longer enjoy this app. I left Facebook because I was force-fed certain posts, and had to hunt for posts of friends and BUSINESSES I AM PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN Will probably leave Instagram, too. It's no longer social. Also, when friends are hacked there is NO HELP OR RESPONSE from Facebook Meta support team. This is no longer a safe space for your privacy or data"
"Ministry Of Truth. Simple: if your memes dont allign with instagrams world views, you get shadow banned. If you dont know what a shadow ban is , its an un-offical ban. You still have full access to your account. However the stuff you post, will suddenly no longer show up on other peoples Insta feeds. On top of that, Instagrams paid advertising service is a scam. It doesnt work and isnt seen by anyone either. If you make memes your days on the platform are numbered. Also Instagram shares all of your personal Data with China"
Privacy. There is none
For a Company that steals information. Whats the point of having a Not Interested option if youre not going to change the kind of content showing up on my feed?
Instagram. I love Instagram more when it comes to privacy because you can have more privacy on their site than Facebook website and thats a shame you can block a person for real on Facebook you can block someone but still see anything they post on their timeline publicly if their still block plus when you report a person harassing you they dont do anything to a person or contact them by giving them a warning saying stop harassing people on Facebook or their page will be deleted thats why I love Instagram more because I never had any problems 
Instagram is invading peoples privacy. Why is Instagram deliberately locking people out of their accounts and then demanding peoples phone numbers to get back in? Since when are you allowed to force people to provide sensitive and private information?You need to be exposed for this
Update will screw you. Instagram was one of my favorite platforms due to the layout and sharing features but the recent updates have put ridiculous restrictions on how you can use Instagram. My account which is only a personal account to begin with has been action blocked meaning I basically cant do any of the major functions of engagement in the app which defeats the purpose of connecting with people through it. These restrictions seem extremely heavy handed and are pushing people away from the app especially for businesses and influencers. If they dont allow people the freedom to like comment and follow any way they see fit I dont see the point of such a restricted social media
"Privacy Concerns. So I understand Instagram is down for the day as of October 4th 2021 but Ive heard yall are gonna be able to access our cameras, contacts and everything and be able to watch us at any point thru the camera this is what Ive heard ofc Im not sure if its true but if it is I will be deleting this app because just no yall are not about to be all up in peoples personal business that has NOTHING to do with Instagram itself so Id greatly appreciate it if u could confirm this please and ty"
"No security or safety. My account was hacked by someone who then immediately changed the phone number, password, and email address associated with my account. I followed every available step in the help centre but it doesnt even give information on what to do if all your information is changed by the hacker. It wont even remember my device as safe to log in from now. Instagram is literally NO help, there is no way to contact anybody or even have the account deleted. This person now has access to the hundreds of photos and profiles on my personal account. I dont know how this is acceptable. So disappointed"
Adds and sorting algorithms mar a lovely app. As states in the title. Especially the weird prioritization modalities of Instagram suggest a sinister hierarchical agenda. Sort bases on chronology alone and Ill forgive the invasive data-collecting add bombardment
"Incessant Ads and Increasing Censorship. I enjoy the platform for sharing stories and connecting with others, but take issue with the privacy policy (the lack of respect for privacy, really). I also despise ads and am bombarded by them nearly constantly on Instagram. I also notice so many amazing folks are censored and shadow banned, and I think that is highly problematic"
Bugs all the time and privacy not safe. Why do u need access to all those infos and collect all those data Its just not nice
"The Great Rabbit Hole. Theres no doubt in my mind that Instagram is trying to get people the content, they believe they want, but their design of connecting posts through a scroll view of a single post on your discover is extremely cumbersome. Content is being fed to you yes, but at the end of the day, is it content that you actually want or need, with all the data gathered from usage, cant your content be more tailored or more individualized, than the rabbit hole of seemingly related posts with hashtags, or categories"
"One of the best social medias out there. I love the way that Instagram lays out the stories, posts and comments, with everything being so easy to navigate, and the general style and layout being  so efficient to change to suit your needs, depending on if you are using Instagram for a personal, business or professional account"
"Racist & anti-Semitic company. Instagram uses their power to censor posts and hide comments/posts related to topics aka PALESTINE that go against their prozionist, terrorist loving narratives. They willingly hide our posts, prevent us from sharing, and will go so far to delete posts/stories/comments and blame it on a bug. The Zionism shows. The racism shows. The pro-children murder lovers shows. The anti-semitism shows. Dont use this app. Youll be happier without it. Respect for Apple for shutting down your money hungry privacy"
Instagram. No access Data? Weird
"Censorship. Immoral, corrupt, and bias manipulation of data.  Policy and censorship without conscience"
Stealing personal information. Every time I am chatting with someone. After a few minutes It starts showing me ad regarding what I am talking about. F*** privacy
"Censorship and shadow bans. It was amazing until Facebook bought it and now its just a data collector, censoring, ad hungry machine"
"Update. New privacy policy is alarming. Knew they could see a lot of your personal info but its gone too far. Content isnt what it used to be either, the whole explore page is just reposts from Pinterest twitter etc. and moving the shop button where notifications used to be to fool with peoples muscle memory and force them to use it doesnt sit right with me"
Its a meta app. Great for collecting information on users for free. Also doubles as a photo app
Data viper. Instagram is suggesting I connect with phone contacts who Im not connected to on instagram or Facebook. My iPhone settings explicitly deny them access
"Analytics and advice to improve. You should be able to see who unfollows you on the analytics page. I believe this because many companies and people download unsafe analytics apps which hack their Instagrams but if Instagram just has the feature it would not happen. Viewing who unfollowed will also be ver good for companies and their marketing. Please make this happen there is nothing bad that can come from it, if anything people would enjoy the app much more. also I AM KICKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT AND YOU WONT LET NE BACK IN, I have not been hacked or anything it keeps asking for my phone number for a security code but you guys never send it I have tried many phones and you guys repeatedly never ever send it. Its been a day since this is happening you guys need to get it together. IM NOT EVEN HACKED"
Big Brother is watching. Why do you need our health info
"I wish i could rate this 0 stars; Im rating it 5 so people see this. In addition to being a glitchy app, Instagram supports animal abuse and child trafficking by not deleting accounts proven to do these horrid things. No matter how many people report they ignore it and say we choose to respect all cultures and beliefs. This app is full of glitches that disregard your privacy. It will randomly send images from your camera roll to your contacts. It also collects so much data. In addition it chooses to allow horrible disgusting content to stay posted; even when it is brought to their attention via report the deny the issue. 0/5"
"Sort Profiles into Groups. Please make it so we can group different accounts we follow into folders/tabs whatever so we can see their feeds in different threads. I follow a lot of of diverse profile topics but because of the algorithms, and just how many I follow, I can never keep track of all of them. If I could sort and review them by say: creative, educational, fashion, kid stuff, etc. I would actually be able to use Instagram more effectively and help comment on and engage with posts more"
Using mobile data. The instagram is using much mobile data than  previous
Disabled my account for no reason. Instagram / Crap stealing information facebook has disabled my account for no reason and wont let me into it anymore. I used it only to follow my favorite art influencers and I was going to post some of my art. Now I cant even appeal because it shows no option to do so. I lost that account for ever. Facebook please sell instagram you are just ruining it like everything you touch. Instagram is turning morphing into another crap facebook FULL OF INVASIVE PERSONALIZED ADS THAT STEAL INFORMATION. They have no customer service on instagram just the help section which is NOT USEFUL. When you open Instagram it has a section where it says from facebook.. Facebook we know you steal our information please stop
"glitchy and unpolished. ive had instagram since 2015. it updated a few days ago, which is fine and all, but ive found that when i go to post pictures and zoom in on them in the posting interface, it zooms back out again in the next screen, or not until after i post it, in which case i have to delete it and go through the same process all over again. the dev team is getting sloppier and sloppier every update. i expected better.edit 11/24/20: im removing a star. id remove both if i could. on top of everything i mentioned above, the app is nosey and collects way more information than it needs (like what apps are running in the background pay attention to yourselves, not the rest of my apps)in the updated terms of service, they claim a license to use any kind of media users post without permission. they wont claim its theirs, but they have no problem using it for themselves or selling it to companies for ads or information. no matter if its art, pictures of your friends, memes, videos from a concert, anything, they claim a license to use and/or sell it without your permission. theyve also been trying to turn instagram into a combination of every media app ever, and its getting obnoxious. you dont need to be facebook AND tiktok AND youtube AND amazon AND snapchat AND... the list goes on. theyre constantly stealing features and purposes from apps they dont even own, and theyve been called out on it but they still continue to do it even though its very obvious that no one likes or uses them. it just goes to show theyre more interested in making money than making their app usable. not to mention the fact that the new algorithm takes interactions away from small creators accounts as a relatively small account, it is incredibly demotivating to have just over 2.5k followers and not even get 300 likes on every post, and only about 15% of those people were already following me. its been like this for months now and its awful. my account has almost completely stopped growing, whereas up until september or so i was gaining around 10 followers a day. i dont even make a profit off my account. now imagine how it is for people who do. they are losing income because instagram wants to encourage us to use their post promotions. or, in other words, they want us to pay THEM just so our own followers will see our posts absolutely outrageous. i have genuinely considered uninstalling, but instagram is the only way i can talk to a lot of my friends right now. its a horrible app run by a horrible company"
"Wiped Out. All I did was log onto Instagram on my iPad, and it wiped out everything in my account (including what was on my phone) and reverted my account to everything I had in my facebook account about 10 years ago. Where it got all that old data and pictures Im not sure, I quit Facebook ten years ago, but I guess they save it all for a rainy day.Brutal systemDELETED FOREVER"
"HORRIBLE. Theyll allow Others to get naked, Show their private parts, Post up Sex pictures, have sex in Their posts, and draw Sexual photos, and even put up pornography. BUT WHEN and IF You talk about God, say the word Prostitute or beat, and Other clean stuff Instagram automatically removes the good Godly things BUT STILL Yet Promotes the Demonic, Sexually, Pornography, and Disrespectful things. Thats exactly WHY I refuse to support Anything of Facebook and Instagram"
"Privacy. You know why, Zuckerburg"
"Sad. Facebooks invasion of privacy not enough? How about a million more ads on your scroll and nothing of what you follow on your feed? You see two of your follows and the rest is ad or spam trash from pages you dont even follow, so whys it on my feed? Facebooks mind control for advertising, thats why. This app went from great to complete poo who fb took over insta"
This in neither Instant or a Gram of bandwidth. Lots of bugs when linking Facebook accounts &amp; pages to Instacrap. Plus the data u receive from users is never fully disclosed and hidden under lengthy legal jargon. This is a scam application much like Tic Tac Tok
"1984 privacy invasion and censorship. Instagram is an app based on censorship and manipulation. What you actually like will not show up in the explore part. If you like a dog picture youll get those, if you like hunting they wont show those and remove likes so you have to like it twice. Theyll show underage girls twerking but you cant watch someone throwing out ballots. You can watch a child drag show but you cant look at empty vaccine syringes. They also now can invade all your privacy with their new terms of conditions. They can track your location and observe you through your camera and look through your pictures"
They sell all of your info including home address to direct mailers. So the soulless of Facebook has crept into Instagram as well. Ive gotten 2 direct mails from 2 things I clicked on. Instagram isnt good enough for me to stick w them
I have written comments. I have returned to using the Instagram app in July of this year this time I am using it smart this time the one thing that does blow my mind about the developers of this app is in the settings where to have a blue dot on your account its stupid where it says to send your tax returns or your passport info or drivers license like seriously developers? If someone knows there own account is legit they dont need to give that personal info through the app its these fake celebrities accounts with the blue dot they need to look out for
Bring back chronologic order. I follow people because I want to see them on my feed. If I dont want to see them post I unfollow. Enough of this data collecting to decide what I want to see or not see. Data and robots should not decide what I want on my feed. I should be the only one deciding that. Instagram is going to fail in the future if it keeps doing the opposite of what people want. BRING BACK CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Or somehow incorporate that with all the data collecting I want to see peoples posts and I want them to see mine
"Loved this app... but not anymore. Instagram used to be one of my favorite social media apps, but it hardly qualifies as social media any longer. Instagram exists to MAKE USERS BUY THINGS. An ungodly number of ads pollute the users Instagram feed... and the recent update even added a shopping tab. Instagram transparently collects data from its users to peddle products to them. Its unconscionable"
Instagram connects globally . Great way to connect with loved ones and the global community. Gives us the privacy to communicate with who we choose and keep our posts private if we choose
Privacy. Trying to ensure privacy
"Cant delete. I do not want to temporarily delete my account. I signed up thinking if I got bored I could just delete it and my data would be deleted as well. You CANT DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT You can disable it but all of your data, your name, your pictures, all of it is kept on their servers.I disabled my account and now Im going to release the information of all the people behind Instagram. Maybe that will teach you some respect (: see you soon"
"Censorship and Spam. I used to love Instagram. I have 5 accounts. I rarely update them anymore because I despise the overly moralising outlook of the moderators on this platform. I had a very arty cool Fetish photography page killed even though there were no adults parts on display at any time. Despite this I havent deleted the app, but I have all but stopped using it. Even though I switched off all notification in-app I still get tons of spam notifications telling me about someone that Im following liking or posting somewhere. IG, honestly I dont give a crap. These notifications design as lures have had the total opposite affect of what you intended and now I just view IG as another capitalist institution that cares way more about customer exploitation than customer service. Instagram is not in the 21st century. In fact its barely in the 20th century. With insane double standards regarding censorship and 3x more junk mail than you get in your inbox I regard them as just another multinational corporation that leaches off its users. Have fun battling their catholic algorithm trying to get famous. Its an uphill battle to the death.I just wish that it wasnt worth it"
"Corrupt App. Not the most secure app. The app tracks your every move. Instagram collects a lot of data, data that can be accessed by its staffers. They can call it monitoring but sometimes that staffer lives in your neighborhood"
Face ID. Id like it if you guys could do a face ID or something every time you click into the app for privacy. Like how some of the other apps are when you click on it you do face ID or type in a password. Maybe if you put it in the instagram settings so it an option and not mandatory
Love it but. My instagram is saying that I need to  enable my camera and microphone and I go to settings and go to privacy and camera or microphone and it said apps that need this will appear here and I dont see anything at all so if you know what to do then try to let me know
"Nothing personal. I love Instagram, but I get too many sponsored posts on my feed"
"Horrifying, Disgusting Targeted Ads & Content. My last review isnt present, likely due to an app update, but the issues with harassing targeted media still continue. Feed content is so disgusting after recent harassment from California & uc berkeley employees towards app users (very ugly, naked, pregnant, unappealing photos recommended by followed hashtags that have nothing to do with the hashtag). Employees are obviously abusing their work privileges to harass users. Its sad seeing the apps content quality degrade to this level. I also dont have the chronological feature that was announced in the news. Meta doesnt care about user privacy since they wont prevent messages and accounts from being hacked. There should be an option to opt out of being a Guinea pig in this social experiment"
"Instagram. I find this app very good, because you can interact with your friends, post cool pictures or videos and look at other peoples videos. There is also a good privacy policy on which you can make your profile private so only people you choose can view it. And if you want to follow a private account, the person who runs the account has to accept the follow request, and there are a lot more older teens and adults than kids because this is a platform social media. But overall this is a great app"
"Privacy issues. More than once i found my photos shared without my permission and when i report that to instgram, no action is taken"
"Tracking. Even though I select do not track, this app knows exactly what to show from using other apps. Seems like more privacy invasion"
Policy. Change your policy and give us more privacy. As soon as better alternatives come along Im switching over ASAP. The fact that you can use my camera whenever you want and sale my information is crazy
Down with Facebook. Facebook need to be taken down by the Reddit crew. Big company that only protects your privacy when they are forced too
Instacoin. Instagram is ok as long as they bend over and lick bitcoins testicular Coinbase  Return the illegal data or be arrested.     It will be recalled in to its source so try not to fingerprint the data too much.  Peace Out Tricks
"Chronological feed please. I really like Instagram, but I hate the algorithm it uses. I want to see posts from the people I follow, as they post. Also, its been several months that the music sticker has been missing on my business account. Im in the states, my personal account can use it, so idk what the problem is"
Bring back the old ig. Instagram became too nosey not enough privacy... they know what you post nd deletes it this app just like Facebook i hate it. We need a new app that allows freedom of speech
Capitalism Prevails. The newest update for Instagram clearly shows that they are focusing their energy on Instagram shopping and Instagram reels. They clearly do not respect the value that customers put in the enjoyable experience of viewing peoples pictures and videos online. Now Instagram is just doing everything they can to keep our attention on the Instagram app for as long as possible so that they can get us to buy on their store and so that they can sell our data and run more ads
Insta Ads. So many ads its hard to tell when youre actually seeing your followers post. Privacy is not instagrams speciality. Be prepared to have your personal info spread out to the world when you join
Being locked out of my old Facebook. So I couldnt get all my data back and social media because I have a iPhone thanks for not letting me get back into my old Instagram 3rd time now Not happy at all
The best social media app. Instagram is a great multipurpose app with high privacy
"Instagram privacy. Terrible, for this older person to get hacked. Im so done with this app"
Crappy privacy policy. Directly targets sex workers/artists/any type of female empowerment
Need to go backwards. Prior to being bought out my Facebook owners it was a hub of exploration and keeping up with friends and family. Its difficult to impossible to add to story without getting tired of the stress and over encumbering journey just to share a picture of video. I use the app significantly less. Like Snapchat before it was capitalized and only us Ed to collect and sell data. Its TRASH
"Tons of fake and spam accounts. I am constantly message requested, follow requested by spam accounts. When my profile is set to public, tons of spam accounts are viewing my stories, or I am tagged in spam account pictures with Snapchat QR codes in them. It seems that the culture at Facebook has less to do with the user experience and more on censoring points of view that silicon valley group thinkers don&#39;t like. Trash"
"What the heck. Well Im scared for my privacy on this app, Ive been using Instagram for my private account which no one follows and its basically a diary, today I commented something on my own post and the comment immediately got taken down for violating the community guidelines um no one is supposed to see what Im posting on that account, not even Instagram, so why are they viewing my story and invading my privacy?"
"Not private enough. When it comes to privacy, Facebook is for the win. Not a fan of Facebook. Why dont you guys figure something out on how to hide followers and following. That would be great great"
"Billing Info Needed?. I was having troubles with Instagram, so I deleted the app and tried reinstalling it. This usually helps when apps such as Instagram and Facebook are giving me trouble. This time when trying to reinstall the app, it is asking me for my billing information. I do not have a business account so I do not understand why Instagram would need my billing information.  This is very frustrating, since I use Instagram to keep in touch with a very large amount of people"
"Censorship is real, social media is fake. Scary how this social platform has become a heavily policed and irrationally censored bot space. Theres more AI interaction than human at this point. This and all social media apps exist solely to track, trace and harvest personal data and behaviors for the purpose of exploitation.The founders and owners are nothing more than puppets for the oligarchs.Time to wake up"
Still a political platform pusher. Instagram continues to force-feed political information down your throat rather than focus on picture sharing. Getting sick and tired of the force-feeding from Facebook. At no point should Instagram ever pop up anything about an election
very restrictive and violates privacy on a reg basis. Blocks posts that its employees dont like. People that dont like your post report them and they are removed if they are opposite of IGs political stance
Deleting your app now. Social media listens to everything and invades your privacy
"Why cant I download Instagram?. I wanted to take a break and it has only been not even 24 hours. I temporarily deactivated and deleted Instagram because I needed a break but at the moment, I am currently in a potential dangerous situation and need to talk to my friends and family about it. When I tried to download the app again, it was demanding me my billing address. I find it ridiculous. Is it absolutely necessary? I gave my information and still shows that I cant download it. My security code is the exact same on my own card but its invalid? This whole mandatory billing address for this app is honestly ridiculous. Im not using that app to buy anything on that app specifically. Why would I want to give my information to Instagram when I am not going to be benefiting from it at all. I hope you guys change it on IOS. If youre target audience is 12+, why are you expecting them to give their card information?"
Deleted because of the Horrible terms of service. Deleted because of the horrible terms of service. No only older people have Facebook and they have no young people to spy on so they bought Instagram and change the terms of services so that they can go and spy on the young people. I will re-download the app when they change the terms of service
"DO NOT install this privacy-invading app. When you use this app, it can access to every piece of data on your phone without your knowledge. Privacy does not exist if this appexists on your phone"
"Love the actual app, privacy is sad. I love the app but I just assume that everySingle thing I say and photograph is on the Instagram servers. I hope Im wrong but I doubt it"
"Personal is great, business isnt. Using Instagram for my personal account works great, not that I use it very much. However, using it for my business is not great. It has blocked me from posting for days, it wont let me like anything or follow anyone. Theres no customer service number or email, reporting the problem is useless. Im disappointed"
"Predatory terms. This app has predatory terms of use. You relinquish all digital and cellular privacy and autonomy by agreeing to use IG. I will no longer be using this platform for personal use. I encourage others to consider how much of their personal privacy and safety they are willing to relinquish to use this app. In addition, they consider themselves the gate keepers of opinion, facts, research, and of all healthcare discussion. They do not support a diverse community, and remove, delete and censor anyone who violates the beliefs and positions of their company, and stakeholders. This is not a safe place for connection with your peers and community, by threatening your free speech, autonomy and privacy"
"Terms of use . Its disgusting what these people get away with. If you use Instagram you have agreed to allow the application have access to other applications on your phone that are completely unnecessary for Instagram other than them collecting your private information so they can continue to exploit for profit with your personal information. JUST READ THE RECENT TERMS OF USE The app should also have an option to remove the explore page due to its distracting nature. I dont want to see these repost chaotic accounts anymore, would redownload the app if it stopped trying to exploit its users"
"UNUSABLE. I cant upload photos, I cant access saved posts. The support is absolute garbage. Shouldve never got back on instagram, now I remember why I should value my privacy"
"No privacy. Only on Instagram will I keep getting notifications that different people from different states are logging into my account, but I dont have an option to change my password or even lock them out of it so I have to keep dealing with random people hopping on and off of my IG. Great app"
"Downward trend. Instagram is good for sharing pictures and keeping up with people. The privacy settings are also pretty thorough, so its easy to limit the pool of people who can contact you. The downside is that you will be constantly interrupted by advertisements and suggested posts from influencers and companies, even if you use a private account with friends and family. It used to look super clean-cut and user friendly, but has recently started to resemble a crowded Facebook feed"
Regarding friend list. The must be a privacy to lock the friend list. Because sometimes we come to k ow that some strangers are our mutual friends with others also. So its a humble to you to make the friend list able to have privacy over there on instagram
"Instagram. Instagram has some good things but we need to address many things with Instagram. Bullying, algorithm, security/privacy, people/celebs spreading false news, brand deals, bot/ xxx accounts following or trying to follow you, accounts you didnt follow on your feed and so on. Facebook has its many flaws but they have addressed many of the above issues and as a user of Instagram for 8 years it needs to change. People dont go back to Facebook/Twitter for no reason. Just try stopping bullying and false news to start with?"
Disgusting behavior allowed. Instagram doesnt do anything about account s that leak private information. Personal images and nsfw content of others. Its disgusting
"Priorities not in the right place. I have an account that needs to be public because I am a photographer and its how I promote my photos and engage individuals.I am a woman and once in a while post selfies. And this spam account ( same person different accounts ) steals womens pictures and uses them for an account with a pornographic bio . Saying  watch my P**** These accounts have made themselves known to me by consistently watching my stories. If they are on my profile I am genuinely afraid they are taking pictures of my face for one of these sick fake accounts. Instagram has only removed only one. The rest Im notified  doesnt go against community standards . Doesnt surprise me Facebook and Instagram are run by the same company. Youll remove photos or posts if its not your opinion but youll keep all the nasty , harassing, sex spam accounts up and running.  For that 2 stars when if I didnt have this issue it wouldve been 5"
"Let me pay for the app I want. If Instagram would allow the option to opt out of algorithmic feeds (and return to chronological feeds), to stop showing all ads, and most importantly, stop collecting and selling my data and content, Id pay for that. Id subscribe monthly to have those options. I think a lot of other people would too. Stop the ads. Stop harvesting my information. Stop forcing me to have the experience in your app that you think I need/want. I hate what this app has become. But until someone fixes makes something better, its what Im stuck with. Make it better"
New terms of services. Ridiculous abs huge invasion of privacy. Everyone who works for instagram should be ashamed
Privacy. The lack of privacy and ability to use the app without having to let it listen
"The new update is ungodly awful. I have multiple grievances here but despite these, I still use this app habitually so take it as you will. First off and most recently, the new update is awful, who wants to make it harder to access likes, comments, and follows in favor of a Facebook marketplace knockoff. Granted, I know its owned by Facebook, but still. Whats the point of *social* media but to be social and interact with others? Secondly is the lack of privacy in the app. I disabled all location settings because despite my nigh on obsessive use of social media, I value my privacy and dont appreciate my information being sold to countless unknown companies. Now, explain to me why I get advertisements stating the exact city I reside in even though I have location services disabled? This is why I left Facebook years ago and avoid it like the plague because of the abhorrent lack of privacy. Thirdly I despise how absolutely inundated the app is with advertisements; every third post on the timeline is an ad Id pay money to never see ads again because frankly, this is absolutely unnecessary and unacceptable. Instagram is becoming more and more like its parent company every day and its not a good thing"
News feed and sex bots. The Instagram news feed has now made it difficult for me to view anything else on the timeline. All I see from my following is business pages and Instagram verified accounts on my news feed. It makes it difficult for personal pages to post pictures and interact. Theres also been a huge sex bots account viewing peoples stories. Im not the only one experiencing this. Seems like spam accounts. I get like 5-8 of them everyday viewing my stories and Ive heard others experiencing 10x that amount
"suggestion. i love using instagram to keep up with what my friends are doing and to meet knew people. i have a few concerns though. it can get SUPER buggy. for example, a lot of times it says i have a dm thati havent seen but in reality, there isnt one there. it does this ALL THE TIME. also, i get notifications saying i recieved dms from certain people, and when the messages dont show up in my list and i ask them what they said, they tell me that they never sent me a dm at all. i also have a suggestion for personal and business accounts. when it comes to viewing insights on posts, it would help out a lot to see not only how many shares and saves a post got, but who saved and shared the post. its just good information to know especially for business accounts that want to see the types of people who are into their products and stuff. great app, but just a little buggy and i wanted to make suggestions"
Insta. Instagram is a although the only app I use when I want to post things and want to share personal things its a great app when you need to talk to friends
An idea. I have an idea about increasing Instagram privacy. It would be perfect if the owner could choose who is able or allowed to see their followings and who isnt allowed to see them. It will give perfect privacy and safety to public pages. Would appreciate it if you consider this.Thank you
Inconsistent and frustrating. Instagram is the most inconsistent experience depending on what accounts logged in. Currently my main account is in an experimental a/b testing group for snap scrolling. I never consented to testing for Instagram and was forcefully placed in this. This feature makes the main feed an absolute chore. There is no free scroll and the feed snaps to each post like Im browsing reels. I think Facebook/meta would benefit from incentivizing these programs rather than forcing them upon people. I dont understand why everything has to be an underhanded tactic to collect data or get you to buy something
"Your support needs support. - I&#39;ve been restricted from using the app for unclear reasons until May 24th- It is May 24th now and I&#39;m still getting the same message. - I&#39;ve been unable to use the (tell us if we made a mistake button) or contact support, if support even exists for this app.- I&#39;m unable to even deactivate my account temporarily.- But I&#39;m still getting notifications from it and messages that I cannot access or respond toWhat kind of activity are you protecting the other users from?I feel like my account has been hijacked by the app itself, without giving me any reasons or ways to dispute, I&#39;ve been an Instagram user since before Facebook aquired it and I can see the difference, horrible updates, bugs, no support, fake accounts, trying to copy whatever competitor apps are doing, cramming shop and reels where they clearly don&#39;t belong on this platform.It&#39;s clear that Facebook is dying and maybe they see Instagram as their life line. Hopefully Apple gets into this social media game and does it right with their great support and privacy, then I&#39;ll be the first in line"
New Terms of Use and Service. Privacy means nothing anymore. You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Pathetic
About Instagram feed backing. I havent I hadnt I dont and I wont watch the best app in the present App Store Google play store also the others UI which is on other mobiles thats their privacy and I havent watched such a wonderful experience with them on Instagram thank you  Zuckerberg so its really really fantastic job you have done by taking the Instagram and connecting those FB and Instagram on WhatsApp and Twitter also so I kindly request you to continue this year by year time by time month my bank second by second thanking you signing of MMKS speaks
"Instagram features. hi instagram, i just wanted to say how i didn't like how u had this feature where you know the info of you're old users and stuff which embarrasses me pls try to remove that feature.where you go go settingsto security and access data.i want to clear out my information on there.I also want to add one more suggestion I would like you guys to add in the app. I want this feature to hide my following in instagram because right now people have been stalking my following and following my mutuals which annoys me"
"too many privacy problems. Even with contacts syncing turned off I am still recommended my email contacts constantly. The targeted ads are way too creepy and specific. The non-chronological feed is obnoxious, Ill see the same 3 people\'s posts over and over again at the top of my feed (usually celebrities or people I barely know).  I can\'t even try post videos without the entire app glitching.  Absolute garbage.  Instagram is the new facebook"
"Really Concerned about privacy and safety compliance. Instagram is the only app on my phone that constantly freezes and acts up. Today I was making a reel, and when I was about to edit it, it crashed and sent me to the Home Screen. I tried more than two times to see if I could edit it or if I had to start over. My concern here is that every time it happened, it turned off my Bluetooth which made me realize that Facebook is actively listening in the background without your permission"
should add some features. i love ig however i feel it should have more privacy features.like blocking people from seeing who you follow or who follows you. reason being crazy stalkers who are miserable and utilize that ability to write who we have on our follow lists to talk nonsense. smh maybe add the feature to only allow people you follow to see your story instead of having to create a personal friends list. also blocking people the ability to see who likes your photos just like we can block from comments being viewed. a toggle option would be great. idk the way the society is nowadays with bullying &amp; harassing i feel that would be a great idea
"Privacy??. This app was great before facebook bought it. The new terms and service is disgusting, what ever happened to privacy ?"
"Wise up, sheeple. The funny thing about a high percentage of reviewers on here is that they have minimal intelligence. They rate Facebook lowly, in some kind of protest vote about how they are stealing your information etc etc, but they dont think to apply the same logic to Instagram - who Facebook own too ? Just goes to show they care more about their narcissistic photo app, which employs the same data collection techniques they loathe on Facebook. Think smarter peeps x"
"E X T O R T I O N              . Facebook and instagram EXTORTING me for my id or bank card. A company who may be the biggest personal data leak catastrophe wont let me use my recovery key, not the three friends voucher, not my password, sends me a reset password link via text, but fails to send login code when clicked ONLY allows me (forcing me) to give up my bank card and I.D. Card to gain access to my private property/personal data and inf. Here\'s the best part..... THIS COMPANY NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO AVOID CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AT ALL COSTS. no number, no email,no in person. Dmv and banks u either have to go inside n see them or can call while both deal with those two main areas id and personal info/money finances etc. facebook and ig have accounts that are fan pages, products, nobodies, somebodies, fake, u name it. But it thinks it is so powerful and righteous that even after LEAKING millions of ppls DATA it can FORCE u into sending them bank cards and id\'s? And also  REFUSING to let  me use ALL THE OTHER \security measures\ put in place like email, password, three friends, RECOVERY PASSWORD, all of that which in turn makes this EXTORTION. Bad things ahead for all these entities involved in a silly thing called \PRISM\ look it up people"
Personal information. YOU NEED to MANUALLY look into people posting other peoples PERSONAL INFORMATION because I REPORTED SOMEONE WHO DID. And YOU SAID THEY Didnt VIOLATE your RULES. FIX THISLOOK at the PICTURES
"Should provide additional sharing options. While I enjoy being able to share pictures with friends and family and seeing their pictures as well, I wish IG offered the ability to share selected posts publicly without having to make your whole profile public. Facebook allows you to choose whether you want to make your post/picture public or private, so why cant IG?? I dont want to have to make my whole profile public when I only want to share selected posts with the world. I have since created a second account to share my amateur photography work publicly, but when I post and refresh my feed, my photos disappear"
"Could be much better. Constantly getting weird and unnecessary updates and features. Even more horrible censorship. Let people have opinions, the internet should be a place where people can have different ideologies and opinions. And no one is going to pay money to use Instagram just cause you want our data. Keep this up and you are going to start losing users"
Instagram. I love it better than TikTok and less cellular data it is amazing and you can chat with friends
"Eh. It is a good app and I like using it, but of course, it is owned by Facebook, so they have no concept of privacy. After I allowed Instagram access to my camera and microphone, I would notice the lights on the top of my screen, alerting me, at random times when I was using no app, that my camera and/or microphone was on. After I blocked Instagram access to my camera and microphone, this was not a problem any more. To be fair, though, what less could you expect of Zuckerberg. He values a penny more than anybodys personal privacy"
A something I want you to add please and some additional things. Well first Im suggesting A NEW VERY VERY USEFUL THING U CAN ADD TO INSTAGRAM I would like you to add an additional thing in privacy It is the ability to block video chat/call from instagram like you cant video chat/call anyone and no one can video call/chat youThere will be like three Things to choose from:-allow video chat/call from everyone -allow video chat/call from people I follow only-dont allow video chat/call from anyone And when activate the last one the video chat/call icon will disappear from the users chat screen and from anyone texting this user screen I would really appreciate it if u add this since I have a calls phobia.Now hereI like instagram and most of my friends are there I cant leave it bc of those dump and annoying updates and algorithms Heres the bad things in instagram the algorithm hurted too many accounts especially the new artists/editors ect..The activity is waaayyyy too low than before and that makes some people unmotivated to continue sharing and using instagram Second I kindaa like the new messages update BUT what I terribly hate is that connecting between Facebook messages and instagram messages ittss soo annooyyyyiiinnggPlus there is something wrongI have created a new acc as my new maneBut the messages update hadnt recive to me and thats kinda annoying since Im very used to the update and Im suffering from the old ver
Because. Instagram is censoring data condemning genocide. They are allowing fake news to circulate by deleting posts that are depicting truths about human injustices for their own personal agenda. 
Discriminative. Im disappointed in IG giving certain people privileges to certain individuals and not all. Especially since one of the features I would prob use most And thats add music to my videos. Im not sure why Instagram decided to leave me out the loop. But its actually pretty disgusting if they do stuff like that and they are spying on you pushing ad advertising all over the place. If I could have something and get rid of something else. I think you guys get the point by now right?
"terms and conditions. people are saying now with the new terms and conditions that you have access to all of our private info and camera our locations, call log ect"
Why?. Why so many ads? And why are lists allowed to my personal feed that I have accepted to follow 
"Mobile Data & Instagram. I am have trouble trying to Use the app with my mobile data , please fix"
One issue. Ive used instagram for over a year and what perplexing me is that l do feel disgusting to some sorts of pictures and no matter how l sent my feedbacks they still would be recommended to me over and over again at some point of time. I dont know whether it is the mutual data contributes to trick me or the program just enjoy disgusting us at some certain points
no privacy. its alright for chatting but everytime I go to send a photo it sends some other photos Im my camera roll and yesterday it sent photos of my flight tickets and it needs to stop
"No such thing as privacy. I love the app, but I don&#39;t use my real name or post photos of myself... And you shouldn&#39;t either"
Stealing your contact information. I did not allow Instagram to access my contact. And I double check every setting. But still getting notification suggesting friends from my contact. It knows your contact even though you are not allowing them to
"Listens to your conversations. IG uses your phones mic and camera to listen to your conversations, even when not using the app, and searches for keywords so that appropriate ads appears in your feed"
"Hackers. Never add your credit/debit information or buy anything off of instagram If you do, there is a high chance that someone will rip your information. In fact, it is not irregular to have your account hacked. They change your number and email so there is no possible way to get into your account. They have full access to buying anything they wish on your feed. It would be one thing if it only happens here and there but me and a large amount of friends have gotten hacked. They are too lazy to put anyone on their support phone lines, and never get back to any emails. The only reason why it got two stars is because it is a decent social platform, as long as youre ready to loose your info. Im sure if you ask people that have the app, Im sure theyll tell you they've gotten a weird message from one of their friends (who got hacked) trying to sell something WHACK or trying to get you to go to some random link"
"Accounts. Hey Instagram , its kinda of an issue that many peoples accounts including mine havent been working right . As all of ours friends and me have been receiving surveys for random things . We have all checked it own in our own accounts and keeps saying we violated the rules. Also can u help make accounts more safer and not easier to get identify and get access to because my 4 friends have gotten hacked the last 3 days . Thanks for reading this and hopefully this apps improves even though its good"
Privacy. This low privacy
"Data mining and censorship. This app is completely owned by big pharma and corrupt corporations. They censor anything and everything at their whim, while mining all of the data that they want from your private cell phone. Its disturbing. We should all be concerned about their intentions and power"
"going downhill. this app is horribly going down hill. for one, instagram takes advantage of the users privacy. for two, its not a all a seamless experience, its illogical that to watch a video on your feed, you have to continue watching it on a separate part of instagram? ratchet. third, its shifted from a platform where we can see our friends/family/interests posts to adds and shopping at your fingertips. NOBODY WANTS THAT. trash"
Instagram doesnt help. My account Ive had for 13 years has been hacked and they changed all my info. The support Ive received has not been helpful at all Highly recommend you dont use this app
"1 star because of the ads. For every post I scroll I see an advertisement. If I look for something in google , the same product is pops up as an ad in instagram. I am really fed up with these stupid ads. I need my privacy to be intact. Im deleting my instagram account mainly because of these stupid ads"
"NOTIFICATIONS. I get no notifications to my phone about Instagram , I never know who sends me message or likes my pictures  Unless I get on the app , I have my notifications on , on my phone settings even on Instagram I restarted my entire phone nothing from Instagram shows only every other app such as fb , snap , Twitter they all work"
"I would like to. I would like to let you know that I am withdrawing all permission for you to use my images, videos any information. From this day onwards I expect that you delete any personal information from all your data base. Continuing doing so will be a breach of human rights and law"
Worst app like Facebook. They filter contents to fit their agenda not free app anymore Facebook is the father of this along with WhatsApp they all want your information no privacy anymore
"Too many spam accounts, notifications,. I&#39;ve had Instagram since 2012, going to be five years in August.  Over this time instagram has been a really great app to share stuff about your life. Recently though it has been just adding features and notifications (SO MANY NOTIFICATIONS) just to get people to check the app more often. It really has changed from the good social media app it used to be into now a mess of dumb features nobody wants nor really uses. The notifications are out of control. I want to keep notifications on so that I know if someone sent me a message or if people liked my picture. Instead I&#39;m getting countless notifications all day about random people&#39;s live stream or someone who I barely know who posted a picture. I didn&#39;t choose to have these notifications and there is no way to get rid of these specifically. I&#39;ve been using Instagram less and less because of it and will probably stop using it completely eventually. It&#39;s kinda sad to see what used to be such a good photo sharing app and social media app turn into a mess of marketing and click bait.Updated (2020): For every one real account there are 5 spam. The bot accounts have gotten out of control. They appear as prostitutes or pornstars and request to follow my account, tag my accounts in explicit photos, and spam in the comments section. This further pushes the point that what once used to be a fun photo sharing app has now turned into one mess of an app. This is why people are fleeing instagram for other better apps like TikTok"
"Big Brother in an App. Their privacy policy is absurd. Their policy is basically, YOU HAVE NO PRIVACY"
"Questionable features. Instagrams algorithm is spotty but it recommended me the account of a group I know and like a lot and when I went to like their photo it popped up a message asking to try scanning for similar products. It would not let me close the message and I really did not want to hit the try now button because it was an account that I knew and I dont care about other similar accounts. I know the people and did not appreciate the tangent which just wasted time. On a related note suggesting accounts on my personal feed is frustrating. If Im scrolling down on the accounts I follow, Im interested in seeing people I know. I dont want random people or meme accounts and it makes me use the App less. The advertisements annoy me less than because you liked a photo by _____ posts"
"Instagram was great unitill. Facebook ownership and increased censorship and privacy issues, great platform for sharing content and has helped with building businesses but terrible for both freedom of choice and freedom of speech, Im actively looking for a alternative"
Happy me. Privacy is all about Instagram and hustle free.Enjoying 
Instagram is spying on us. They let the camera roll all the time.Plus the shopping tab and ads have gotten out of control. This is a sick capitalistic app that needs to go back to the way it was
"Racist invasion of privacy ruins this great app. I wouldve given Instagram a 5 star rating  until their recent policy change that allows them to invade privacy, spy on people, steal data, read your sms messages, use your camera against your will and a bunch of other shady cloak and dagger big brother stuff.Screw you zuckerberger you slimy evil bastard. And screw all your evil minions who are helping you destroy peoples rights, freedom and sovereignty.If anyone from Apple is reading this o hope they crack down hard on Instagram to protect your customers"
"Instagram and Facebook privacy breaches will be their downfall. Cant wait for Apple to ban Instagram and other invasive apps from iOS store so we can enjoy private and secure respectful apps that the Apple will create Ill jump over to any platforms Apple comes up with any day, granted that they get the approval of true privacy"
"I used to love this app. Everyone on here is commenting about Instagrams pervious update as if people haven&#39;t been verbalizing their discontent for this app since posts stopped showing on their timelines in chronological order. My main issue with Instagram is their guidelines. I have reported posts in the past that Instagram stated didnt violate their guidelines such as bigoted depictions created with George Floyd bobble head dolls too a man shooting himself in the head while people poked fun at the situation in the comments section. Both of these situations were reviewed and deemed appropriate by Instagrams team, yet there has been an uprise of testimonies from POC stating that they have tired sharing their personal experiences on their platform and Instagram has gone as far as deactivating their accounts to silence them. Instagram has continuously proven themselves to be problematic and less concerned about the welfare of those that utilize their apps. I hope people start doing their research and hold Instagram accountable. They owe apologies and need to revise their guidelines. Remember that were the boss people, just saying"
Stop with the information. Wont let me even open the app until I enter my birthday. Stop data mining This is why I never used Facebook and hate that they took over ig
"Serious Privacy Violations. Ive had numerous instances when I suspected Instagram was reading my text messages. I would text something about various topics, then have those topics pop up on the Instagram search page. Tonight it was so blatantly obvious it was infuriating. I sent a simple text message to my wife that I was going to run when I got home. She replied o.k., Im going to start my work out now. When I got home I opened up my Instagram search page to find the entire thing plastered with running and work out photos, completely different of my normal topics. I never searched for anything about workouts or running on Instagram, or Safari, or any search engine or social media platform. The only place running and workouts were mentioned was a text message. This type of spying should be illegal. I am officially uninstalling this app forever and so should you"
"DONT GET IT. Instagram f*caked me over and logged me out of my account for good. Now all of my stuff and information is lost. I repeat, DO NOT GET THIS APP"
Instagram. Great way to see relatives you dont get to see often and friends as well. Also its like youre own personal diary with pictures and easy to use for folks like me lol. Use this in a positive way.
"Deleted the app. I have been using Instagram for years but deleted it because the algorithm has gotten so annoying, constantly showing me pics of celebrities I DONT CARE ABOUT and DONT WANT TO SEE like aging actor bread Pzitt and the sk00t3r bron gang. Its also worrying how close to Facebook they are and all the privacy breaches"
"No user support. Instagram is my favorite social media app. I wish I didnt have to rate it poorly but I have no idea how to get the attention of its developers otherwise. I cannot share posts to my story. Have not been able to for months while my friends all get to use this feature. It is not a privacy issue. The same page allows my friends to share posts but I dont even get the option. Ive been sending general feedback to Instagram but nobody has reached out nor has the issue been resolved. I dont understand why I dont get this feature nor so I understand why I cant get in touch with someone from technical support. Additionally, I think itd be dope to be able to search your collections instead of having to scroll through.Again, I love the app, it is my most used app on my phone, I just want to have the ability to use all of its functions"
"So frustrating. I use to love Instagram until it was bought by Facebook. I opted out of tracking after the last iOS update and am still experiencing signs they are tracking my activities. Just this morning, my coworker sent me a message (not via Instagram) about a product Id never heard of and minutes later Instagram sent me targets ads for it. Total violation of privacy. Tired of social media companies creeping on private conversations"
Useless support number and website. My account got hacked and the hacker was able to change the contact information so I have no way of retrieving my account. Instagrams support page is inaccurate and unhelpful. I cant believe a company thinks its okay to just let people get impersonated and their privacy violated. Wont be creating a new account
"Data Wasters or Disorganised. All of a sudden I have been receiving updates every 2 or 3 days. Any self respecting I T professional know that updates should follow a strict process with updates being released once a month. The only exception should be for critical flaws. Instagram are obviously trying to eat your data or they a completely disorganised. Their parent company, Facebook follows a very similar update schedule - not good"
"Ins against freedom of expression. Control user privacy without permission. The endowment against human rights. Supporting injustice, occupation and tyranny"
"Ins against freedom of expression. Control user privacy without permission.The endowment against human rights.Supporting injustice, occupation and tyranny"
Privacy. You already know
My privacy. My privacy is being violated you all and putting it that violate my privacy
"PRIVACY. FOR THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS AND MYSELF, WHY DID YOU MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ITHER ACCOUNTS WE HAVE I DONT KNOW HOW TO TURN IT OFF, PLEASE HELP"
Buggy and Stealing data. Facebook reads your private dms and uses the data to find relevant ads. App never works when trying to post photos. Crashes all the time. just a horrible experience all in all
"PLEASE add more privacy options for certain things. You should be able to restrict people who follow you from seeing who you follow, and who follows you if you want to. Does YouTube always tell everyone who youre subscribed to? No. Does Snapchat tell everyone every person you have added? No. I get Instagram is more of a media platform kinda like Facebook so it makes MORE sense, but it should be an option to change, or at least restrict certain people from some of your information without just blocking them"
No privacy for my own messages??. I sent a d**k picture to my girlfriend through OUR PRIVATE DMS and then I get notified saying my post violates community guidelines and then proceeds to delete my picture intended for my girlfriend
"I used to love IG. Then FecalBook bought the darned thing... I had thousands of followers and loved showing my art. But, with all thats going on with FB and their business model of people freely giving their info away to use for purposes of making billions off the end user, I havent used the app in about a year Unless something changes DRASTICALLY, I unfortunately wont be using it again Its sad... take a look at all of the data that you give away FOR FREE"
Instagram. Selling data is super lame
Music. I got 2 instagram accounts and one is personal and other is business and I can only use music that I like on my personal one so yh
"A Little Bit Worried. Privacy is iffy with this app~advancements in science, medicine, and technology are possible with the information collected on this social app"
"4 business accounts disabled. I had 4 business accounts with Instagram and I spent over 500k+ in ad spend in the last year alone and all my accounts got disabled due to a competitor mass reporting me and wanting to take me out of business, I have been nothing but compliant of all Instagram terms and policies and reached out to support plenty of times and they just say the same thing over and over which is they are investigating it with there internal team, honestly the support from Facebook and Instagram is terrible my pages are nothing but business related and have not violated any policy issues but just a low life competitor getting his way and not respecting my privacy, so why would you help me Instagram is it because your prejudice against my people or is it because your simply falling off your high horse and someone is taking your place so easily, honestly how disgusting maybe its because Im Muslim they are refusing to help, the case has been ongoing for months. As a customer of this service if I can give It a 0 rating I would with pleasure"
Infringes on Privacy. This app is still tracking me after Ive asked it not to using Apples new update. Very creepy and very invasive. Tailored ads do not make me want to shop or use Instagram more They made me delete the app
Ban. I dont want to ever use Instagram again its stupid and dumb and started to much drama because of your lack of privacy
"Gets worse (more Facebook-like) with every update. GO BACK GO BACK. I swear, with every update. They just add more stupid, annoying, worse things and take away more and more of the features that made Instagram excel in the first place. Im using MeWe, Minds, Parlor and other apps now. Instagram, I do not consent to you spying on me. Just because your updates let you, doesnt mean I give you the right to listen and watch me through my phone. Do better"
New update is horrible. Half of my page is not even anyone I follow. Instagram has lost its mind and I surely will be considering deleting it Top it off they have all access to your phone camera and your contacts. There is no privacy anywhere these days
"Instagram Rocks. Instagram is easy to use, fun and inviting Definitely use this app for social engagement, whether for business or personal"
"Dont like that they Track all the websites. I dont like at all that facebook tracks your every move & collects every website you visit even if you only use one of their products, once. This is very Alarming if every company starts doing this. It is not Surprising marc zuckerberg was Repeatedly threatened to be kicked-out of University for ethics and Privacy violations till he eventually Quit"
Privacy. You guys should really make it to where users can make certain posts unnoticeable to certain people without having to archive the post or block the person
"Instagram is Targeting me. It has been 24 hours since I wrote a bad review criticizing the decision to disable hastags for political purposes, and it has been 23 hours since Instagram has functioned properly for me. Nothing will load, sometimes not even my own posts. I have switched wifi networks, turned on data, restarted my phone, and even downloaded the latest update for both the app and my phone prior to this. I have contacted friends who also have the app and they told me it works fine for them. The only solution I can come to is that Instagram is targeting me, which is more reasonable than you think(at least, ever since Facebook adopted them. Facebook is known for censorship and targeting certain political views). I hope another, better app releases. Something like the Parlor equivalent of Twitter, where you can be sure they arent censoring you"
Review. I cant access my Instagram because my cellular data goes off automatically what can i do
"SHADOWBANS. Ive used this app for several years and it blows my mind that they literally shadowban content they dont like but doesnt go directly against their rules. ANY cannabis content in legal, recreational or medical, states gets shadowbanned. Currently, they removed my ability to save stories as highlights on my profile and I cant post more than one photo at a time (no group posting). But my personal account has both of those features allowed...Instagrams treatment of LEGAL cannabis profiles who are NOT selling products on their accounts is despicable. They should be ENCOURAGING this growing industry to use their platform"
"Action block crazy. This is the fourth time Ive been temporarily action restricted for giving my account information to sites for likes and follows. Not only have I never thought of doing this, I clearly never have. I have a private account and I barely post. Instagram cant be bothered to take down spam accounts or p*rn bots that try to get people to open links, or the endless stream of comments on any public accounts posts from bots or thirst trap accounts. But somehow my private account is being watched closely and they pull the restriction on me. Ive changed my password, Ive reported this problem countless times. Nothing. This app is garbage, and a joke of a platform where bots, false information, and criminals can run rampant; but people that do literally nothing get tracked down and shut down"
"Its Facebook with soft core porn. The content on instagram has become lazier and lazier. Nothing but lip singing, and dubbing. Basically just stolen content. Not only that but Instagram is a Facebook company that collects and sells your data to anyone and everyone, as well as destabilizing governments. Throw in the fact that its mostly just sexualized content and you have yourself a soft core porn site"
Scraping EXIF to circumvent Apple privacy. Company is scraping EXIF data from photos in attempt to bypass privacy restrictions Apple added in iOS 14. Company is extremely hostile to users. Apple needs to take more significant action to resolve Facebook blatant disregard for user privacy
"1984 style censorship and tracking. Very cool app aside from the fact that they literally remove or censor anything that doesnt align with their bought socialist political views and will jump to suspend your account without notice for the fun of it, they enjoy labeling any alternative thought (as in talking about vitamin C or sunshine literally ) unless its what good ole CNN propaganda tells you to think, and they monitor every single personal message, post, story. In theory, awesome app for connecting, in reality, kinda like the dream commie control app. PLUS they scan through every. single. thing. on your phone. 10-4"
Instagram. Doesnt load my feed and on my activity where I can see my likes for my post doesnt load its says couldnt load activity and I disconnected from my wifi and tried it on my data and it doesnt load and it doesnt show for anyone else
"This app has degraded over time, and abuses its power. Instagram started out with few ads, a straightforward concept, and logical community guidelines. It has morphed into a profit centric app owned by facebook with excessive ads, manipulative notifications, a biased algorithm, and unnecessary censorship of free speech and nonsexual nudity. It is not a place for people to express themselves. It is not a safe space for artists. It does not respect your privacy. An app with such widespread use has an incredible power. This power is not being used well. Rampant censorship of ideas that do not fit instagrams paradigm of what is appropriate such as nudity, right wing ideas, and comedy disempowers large groups of people. The only reason I use the app is that everyone else uses the app. I urge you to switch, as I am, to a more private and uncensored platform that does not decide for you what content you post and consume"
Watch out for this garbage from Facebook. This app collects all your info and sells it greedy corporations and thus profits of good people like me and you.The owners of this should be tried for crimes against humanity. We the people demand justice
Too much info needed. I have no interest in adding  my number to Instagram.  You have my email. I get enough spam and nuisance calls as is. I wont do it for Twitter nor will I do it for Instagram. Now you log me out to try to force me into adding my number... to log in? How much personal information does Instagram need?  This was why I deleted Facebook nearly two decades ago. Whats next? My SS and tax ID?
"Tracking is creepy. Ive been using Instagram off and on for a while, knowing about the privacy concerns of Zucks data mining machine, but lately Ive been getting these targeted ads suggesting x app is a perfect alternative for y, Y being something thats installed on my phone. Nope. Im done. Zuck doesnt need to know whats installed on my phone, not to mention literally every single category of data he can possibly scrape from my device. Back to using it in private browsing mode for me"
"New terms and conditions. I will be deleting all social media apps through Zuckerbergs ownership because they VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION AND MY RIGHT TO PRIVACY. Regardless of the consent, it is still a violation and I will not be using it anymore. I have told everyone why I am leaving and more people agree and are joining me. Im sure big tech doesnt care about the little people, but this review isnt for them... its for the little people, wake up little people We are the ones who control the government. We are the consumers of these apps We dont have to LET them control us anymore. If WE ALL stop, they have no power anymore"
"What FB paid too much for Insta... hummm not really ;). Fantastic acquisition driver of growth with Whatsapp today for FB and became a coveted marketing platform and more and more a communication tool away from fake news and irrelevant personal connection or professional use of polluted and controversial FB... still in need of a big fix and return to roots with limited access to university or corporate emails/credentials... and a way better community management, compliance and real transparent (and readable.... not 500 pages) privacy policy and training for users"
Spyware. Don&#39;t download unless you want your personal data and intimate life details shared around the world for corporate profit
Horrible application. Tracks your data and targets your personal information for advertising purposes and other profitable enterprises ~ bugs your phone ~ terrible application do not recommend. Read the fine print as to what they do with your data
Instagram do too much. I dont have enough privacy instagram invades people privacy
"PERSONAL INFO REQD. Deleting this app because its forcing me to give my birth date, sells all my personal info, AND ALL OF YOU ARE SHEEP. Eff Facebook"
Feed Algorithm. My feed algorithm doesnt show any of my personal content or posts from people I follow. I only see paid advertisements and business accounts Instagram wants me to follow. I literally just to see a chronological view of the posts from the accounts I follow
"Too much Facebook influence. Super annoyed by the number of ads in my feed, now they are showing me suggested posts in an attempt to get me hooked on scrolling. This cynical company forgot that I am on this app to interact with my friends, not to see whats trending. Very much looking forward to the day theres an alternative, but chances are Facebook will just buy them up with little over site from our government. I encourage anyone reading this to transition away from Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp because this company does not have your privacy/well-being in mind and sees you more as a product than a person"
"It is spying on you. It is spying on you, just like its parent company FaceBook"
"Be very cautious. My instagram account got hacked and instagram doesnt care. No support. Nothing. Its not a case of carelessness, I had 2FA activated. It was a targeted attack. If you plan to use this app be mindful that your privacy can be compromised at any times and you wont get help at all"
"Privacy settings do not work. Reporting accounts as spam no longer blocks those accounts.People are still able to tag me in posts, even though I have it set so that I have to approve them first. The settings dont work. Facebook ruined a great app"
Instagram took away privacy settings. I used to have a setting under privacy settings for stories that allowed me to opt-in to allow resharing to stories.  I no longer have that option. Why is this removed from my account?? Very disappointed
Censorship. Theyll sell your data flood your feed with ads than theyll go ahead and censor content. I honestly hope they get rid of it on the Apple store
"VPNs Are Blocked, Apparently. I suppose this is just one more example of Facebook invading our privacy and trying to sell our data. I can think of no other reason they would block VPNs. Sometimes it works, but usually it just wont load. So I simply dont use it when that happens. I suppose their goal in blocking VPNs is to get users to shut off their VPN so Facebook can get their real location and sell it. But Ive decided just not to use Instagram when that happens. They probably dont care because Im in the minority, but Im not interested in continuing to let Facebook invade my privacy"
Stop controlling the views. Stop controlling freedom of speech and options and worry about bulliesAnd give me an option to remove the stupid covid info banner cause its getting annoyingIf we can have access and use insta then we sure can do our own research by going to the WHO website
Bad experience. Censors Palestinian content. Forces me to agree to having my personal info tracked by the app
App is censoring data. Free Palestine Instagram stop censorship against the oppression of Palestinian people
"No privacy. This app gives you no privacy You give them permission to look at your call logs, camera, etc.. really read the terms and conditions and look up what you dont know. Get this app out of here. Its dangerous"
Add yours sticker. Im in New Jersey all my friends who lives in the area can use the add yours feature. I dont have it ask sticker option and if my friends post on there stories I cant click on it to add my own. Its really annoying. Ive deleted Instagram and reinstalled. Deleted data and it still doesnt show up
PATHETIC. On all levels Instagram and it&#39;s business practice is totally poor we don&#39;t like REELS not this new stupid algorithm we totally oppose it but I assure you if you didn&#39;t revert back to original then no one can stop Facebook and instagram to be doomed we already are shifting to tiktok thats better option I must say you can F with your Instagram we leaving how does that sound? Money hungry mor ons.Mark shame on you You stole and sell our data without our permission we want your social media empire to go down in rubbles and ashes
Screw Zuckerberg. Instagram is now forcing users to download drivers licenses. I dont trust Mark Zuckerberg to safeguard my personal info. I hope others delete Instagram as I have done
"Hot Mess that Allows Gore and Promiscuous Content on their Site. To put it politely, Instagram is a hot mess. One could talk about the data breaches and proclivity to spy on users and enable cookies that allow ads that seemingly spy on your internet activity, but basing this review on specs, the interface, and the ability for content that goes against TOS to persist, the app is garbage.     The interface is buggy, and has a proclivity to kick you out of the app at random. The amount of bots within the comments is also a huge problem, as the team at Facebook has done nothing to squelch the overabundance of sex, scam, and other types of bots.     The biggest issues relate to the abundance of gore and sexual based pages that are in clear violation of their terms of service, but are too lazy to take care of. Type the word gore or sex, and you will find videos of people dying or people copulating. This app is a joke, and is using the COVID virus as an excuse to not crack down on the rampant bots, horrific content, sexual content, and safety breaches, where taking care of these prevalent issues is something that the entire staff at Facebook Co. could solve within hours inside their homes, thus not allowing themselves to be in contact with the virus"
"Ridiculous. Why am I getting blocked from doing certain things when Im literally just checking the profiles of people I follow? Also, why is buying stuff more important than my actual account activity of my account? And why is there a section for tiktok videos rather than the option to post pictures like before? Its sort of ridiculous. Yall need to set youre priorities straight. For those kind of videos we have tiktok and Im not really against the Instagram store, but the account activity center should be more important"
"Instagram has gone too far. In the new terms, it is clear they are positioning themselves to sell your information and invade your privacy, as well as getting ready to support the violent police state. Get a grip Instagram. I just want somewhere to post photos of moss and trees"
"I cant have this app with a clear conscience. Instagram/Facebook does not take reports of hate, violence, and illegal drug sales on the app seriously. I reported a page that was selling prescription drugs and ecstasy and they said it didnt violate their community guidelines. I reported spam accounts created solely for the purpose of inciting disunity, violence, and hatred in comments on posts mourning the loss of black lives at the hands of police, and they said those pages dont violate their community guidelines. Not only is this unethical, it is disturbing to know how far theyre willing to allow hate to spread. They cant give fake/spam/bot accounts the same rights as real individuals expressing opinions. Doing so allows bad actors to continue to have an influence over a average people in society that theyd never have if not empowered by Instagrams refusal to take action. I will delete this app and then permanently delete my account if Instagram continues to allow hate and division to thrive"
"Was an amazing app For a while. Ive used Instagram for over a year now and Ive loved every second of it. The app is fairly safe and it makes connecting to friends fast and easy. However, Insta just got a new update on its terms, with some pretty sketchy new conditions for using the app. Continuing to use the app after December 20th now means that youve allowed the app to have access to your location, photos not only in the app but on your phone, your contacts and sms messages, credit and debit card numbers, your camera, accounts on other apps, your WiFi router info (giving them access to any device in your home connected to that WiFi), and your DMs. And thats just the beginning. I promptly deleted the app and Im hoping either something changes or a new, safer app comes out. Stay safe, guys"
"New policys privacy violations. NO you may not have unfeathered access to all of my data, contacts, devices on my network, private photos, gps etc etc. deleted the app because of new terms. I will not allow this egregious over reach"
TOO. MANY. ADS. WHY I DONT UPDATE THIS APP. SOOO MANY ADS. IT USED TO NOT BE THIS WAY. RUINS THE EXPERIENCE. I HATE INSTAGRAM EVEN MORE EVER SINCE IT WAS OWNED BY FACEBOOK. NOW THEY WILL TAKE YOUR INFORMATION AND SELL IT TO THIRD PARTIES AGAINST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR WILL FOR PROFIT AND SAY ITS FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES BARELY USE ANYMORE WHEN I USE TO LOVE INSTAGRAM. IT USE TO BE ITS OWN THING NOW ITS JUST A MASHUP OF ALL OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA THROWN TOGETHER. SO UNORIGINAL & CORNY . SCREW YALL
"Bias Glitchy Shitshow. Unfortunately, because I dont share mainstream views and fluff opinions, I frequently experience difficulty with my Instagram. Ive reached out to their call line, having got hung up on, I file support requests frequently, my app up to date, and still have a plethora of issues. At times, not allowing me to like or comment on photos, use tags in posts, mentions on stories, and most recently, not showing who views my content and shadow banning me. Not only have I had my right to free speech trampled on by this app, but it wholeheartedly supports and is one of the very systems and beings to further the degradation of the human psyche. Brainwashing at its absolute finest, promoting and furthering content in an appealing manner to subliminally intercept thoughts, physical and behavior patterns, at max profit. And to a highly impressionable audience of mainly teens and children Not to mention the data that is mined and privacy concerns. The allowing for sexual exploitation of children. Fact checking bull- anyone with a functioning brain can see the fact checks know less than the average American citizen. How about censoring child pornography like you do all views that arent progressive and heinous? This is only the beginning, I suspect Ill hear back now. "
Addictive and data consumer. It makes you addict and also it consumes lot of data
"Censorship and Invasion of Privacy. This app censors marginalized creators yet lets Nazis do what they want. So many leftist accounts have been shadowbanned for promoting violence and hate under very shaky grounds, yet I report a Nazi and suddenly were all allowed to express our own opinions. Now its updating its terms of use to censor anything sexual in a very broadly defined way. Also, it has outrageous invasions of privacy, tracking users without giving us a clear way to understand what is happening. Just another part of a growing social media monopoly"
App is horrible. App has no way of stopping videos from playing. Doesnt limit data usage. You should have a setting to set. For making videos only play when you click on them. So wasteful. Facebook doesnt care about limiting data usage or users privacy
"REPORTING A TECH PROBLEM DOESNT EVEN WORK. A few issues with my Instagram:1) I do not have the Allow Sharing to Story option in my Privacy settings in my personal account. 2) Whenever I try adding music to my stories, it says that there is no music available on my business account.3) When I try to report a technical problem via Help Center from both accounts, it will not allow me to upload a photo or take a screenshot. It wont even let me close the page-I have to completely get out of the app. My app is up to date. I have turned my phone off and on, deleted and reinstalled the app several times. What is going on?"
Its wild. You take photos and post them and then people can see them and then you can later rate the app and share all your info with a big corporation and they can then sell it. So cool
Latest update. So as Ive heard instagram is going to drop all privacy settings and basically stalk us which is probably against the law... Im a minor and feel very scared right now because I dont want people to see me or know where I live and use my private life against me in court if I ever do something bad and I feel like this app should be cancelled and that no one should use it and that the person who chose this should go get a life instead of trying to stalk its own users who actually liked the app before this update. 
Privacy Concerns. It is really disappointing that they require access to all my photos and videos. I should be able to select the photos I want to share without giving them access to everything in my camera roll. I rather stop using the app than allow it to have access to all my photos
"Insights feature went from great to unhelpful. Used to be great, now is just OK. Insights feature now only tells you information from the last 60 days at most, when for business accounts it used to give very good at-a-glance all-time data for all posts. I also dont like that apparently they are moving away from supporting imagery (at least with their viewing algorithms) and are moving towards only supporting TikTok type of posts"
"Entitled. Having an Instagram account is pretty legit. I love being able to add who I please, change my privacy as well. I enjoy giving one that privilege accordingly. Also enjoy the reels. Its a five star for IG from me. ;D"
Deleted my account. Deleted my account - youre part of the problem along with FB and WhatsApp; whos only goal is to gather our personal data and censor what political views we can or cannot see. No thanks
Facebook is hot G A R B A G E. Facebook is evil. Instagram was cool when everything was chronological and didnt think they knew me with their garbage data mining. Reels blows the most
"App privacy. It is nice to finally know what info this app is using, deleting it"
"Ideas to Consider.  Allowing music to be attached to posts while scrolling through pics within the post itself (hard to explain that one). Allow users to post unlimited pictures within one post. Why only 10 pictures? Add algorithms so videos can more easily be given subtitles by new users of Instagram. Subtitles should be allowed to edit-in on any persons Instagram. People want to be heard.  Less bots, pornography/sex solicitation accounts, fake accounts, and FX Bitcoin spammers. STOP CENSORING CONSERVATIVES PLEASE (although I know its part of an organized agenda to get Trump out of office) but come on. Not right. Period. Youre BURNING money by doing that. It should be easier to talk to somebody who works for Instagram/Facebook on the phone. Why is it that NOBODY can ever reach a real person to voice a compliant or concern. That has to change.  No more selling my data to China because you get payed off to do it. Its illegal. Its phishing/selling data just because people tap the agree and continue button when they scroll through the long list of terms and conditions. Contact me if you want any assistance on how to make Instagram better.Have a great day"
"Is this a social media or a peoples market?. Instagrams most recent update and the obligatory suggested posts section are taking from you all control from your account and those accounts you actually follow and want to see. Their persons as product situation is getting out of control. I dont need to see people I DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW As if taking away the chronological postings wasnt enough, now they want us to see yes or yes whatever their stupid algorithm wants. They couldve added it as another tab, but why to put it in your personal feed? Inaceptable"
Privacy. The worst app Ive ever used. My profile picture and username (which is my full name) ended up on this sketchy website. How? Ive never shared or linked my Instagram account to any other platforms
No Privacy. No privacy if you want to just post or look at post you get added into random groups and you dont know the person and its weird
Blessing and a curse. We all know why...illusion of privacy but always watching and collecting data...secretly harvesting the lives of the people. Just my opinion
Missing features + shadowbanning for no reason. I understand that facebook is being weary because of the new EU data laws but why cant we have the messenger features. They literally shouldnt require for the message to be scanned. Actually ridiculous. I have a memepage as well and I get no interactions even tho I have 2000+ followers and they arent bots. My posts simply do not appear anywhere and I havent violated a single instagram guideline. So stupid
Privacy update. Its a person right to privacy &amp; its disgusting thinking you can take that away from ppl. Your app is not worth that
"Insta nice. I like Instagram for more than one reason mainly because its a great way to stay in touch with friends and family and even better too market your product or stay informed on whats going on with people from all over, however Im not too happy about the bots that seem too make your profile follow people you dont know it can be a hassle trying to go through each profile to see if you know them and if you even added them. I like instagram because Im the person in control of my profile and I like my privacy with my social platforms. Please Instagram let me stay insta control and let me not have to deal with third parties. Privacy and control of my phone pictures videos and such are what I want to share when I want too share it. I appreciate the app so please appreciate my sharing respectfully. Thanks Instagram"
Privacy. Recently I have been receiving posts from people and adds from organisations I do not follow
"Pictures and stuff. I mean, we are all like 2 more apps away from having no privacy left and 3 apps away from not actually doing anything anymore. That said, this app works well as it takes your soul. I respect that"
"Excellent social media app for anyone and everyone. Instagram made it very simple to keep your account private or open and change anything at anytime. Its simple to post, change post, delete etc AND Instagram will recommend accounts similar to the ones you follow or personal accounts of people you may know based on the people you follow. I recommend Instagram for anyone who is entering the world of social media or for businesses who would like a social media page, this is the place for you"
Remove the Suggested Posts. I do not want to see anything I didnt ask to see on Instagram. Theres a reason you follow pages and not just subscribe to a constant stream of information on this app. I want to see the people and information i myself have subscribed to and not have that peppered with a ridiculous amount of sponsored ads and poorly algorithm chosen content. This makes the app that much more frustrating to use
The newsfeed choices are annoying. The newsfeed with suggested posts take my options away and choice how I personally review the data. Its a total marketing scam with the algorithms deciding for me and the number of ads nope. Im removing this from my phone and closing my account
some UI issues with calling and anti LGBTQ mods. It's too hard to cancel an accidentally initiated video or voice call and it's too easy to accidentally initiate a video or voice call. Other apps give a big red button centered on the screen to cancel. Major privacy issue. Content moderation tends to punish LGBTQ content for community standards violation and banning of users when equally explicit hetero content is left alone. Disturbing signifiers of violence such as weapons are allowed to remain without any kind of content warning or tap through requirements. Algorithmic content prioritization leaves little room for manual user controlled prioritization based on subject matter (beyond hashtags) or subsets of followed accounts. Content ownership and privacy policies are not user friendly
"Just some thing. Dont get me wrong, I love Instagram You can meet so many new people and friends  its not that glitchy (depends on your WiFi) and very fun to see posts Would definitely recommend Just two things here.1. For reporting, I want insta to add a thief thing you can click to report. So many people have been stealing/hacking accounts, stealing art, stealing private photos, etc.2. Sometimes, I cant like, comment, or post videos. It says Im action blocked. Though the way I fixed it is just deleting Instagram and re installing it; (who ever is reading this and wants insta, it saves your data dont worry) but I suggest you fix this bug. Overall, amazing app"
"No Privacy???. Why do my friends/followers have access to seeing my other friends? Facebook (which owns Instagram) allows the Facebook app to block your friends from seeing your other friends but Instagram does not and that makes no sense This is a massive privacy issue, please update the app and correct this issue. Thank you"
Great App. This app allows people to express themselves You can add text and cool filters (and more) to youre photos/reels/videos Some comments may be filled with hate... Which is why I am so glad you can make youre account private. Followers have to request to follow you and see what you post. If they cant see what you post they cant comment hate to you Also gives you tons of privacy I honestly trust this app with private information and trust it to stay protected by it
"No Support. The last few weeks on Instagram have been a nightmare. I had my accounts hacked and taken over by people posting unauthorized content, scamming my followers out of money, l of this constituting identity theft. Ive had to report these former accounts of mine to get them removed entirely so no more damage is done. This has put my client relationships in jeopardy and I have received no help from Instagram. Ive tried every possible alternative to get in touch with Instagram and Facebook, and I have yet to speak to any person directly, on the phone or through chat. Ive had my accounts for years and its terrible to see all of that content deleted, without having a third party to help me through rectifying this. Im very disappointed as this was the main platform Ive used for my creative and business outreach.  WHERE IS THE HELP, INSTAGRAM?"
Its good. Its better then Facebook. No drama. Keep on protecting me n my privacy. Get rid of spammers n harassers Thank you
"Horrible privacy practices. Straight up horrible privacy policy, deleting the app and using the browsers with tracking blockers for now on"
"Racist company and app. Racist company and racist app who are bias,  steals personal information and is a personal security risk"
"PLEASE Add Tracking Features To Avoid Hackers. I want to start this off with how much I love this app overall However there are a few features Id like to request to counter fraud and hackers. Many people download a third party app to track who has unfollowed them or who&#39;s not following back and other insights not currently provided. This puts the users account at risk of being hacked and could result in a loss of their account completely, cutting off their connections with friends and family. These users wouldnt have to resort to third party tracking apps if they were already implemented in Instagram for them to track without putting their accounts at risk. PLEASE consider adding unfollowers tracking and other alike features into instagram. Thank you "
"Good bye privacy. Everything that can potentially be known about you, this app will track, and sell, to the highest bidder"
"Too many ads and IG spies on you. I cant even get to the content I want to see without wading through all the ads. Too many ads. Makes me not want to use Instagram anymore. The same thing happened with Facebook and now I never get on there.Instagram says that it doesnt listen to conversations if you have your microphone disabled but this is absolutely false I tried to reach out to IG about the issue but there is nowhere to submit your complaints or feedback to. The help center is intentionally useless and has no email, chat or contact information available to reach out to them. The recent updates and elimination of long term insights on your page is terrible. The only insights available are for very short term which I assume is just a way to force you to post more. Facebook has ruined Instagram"
"Place for hackers. Someone will hack your account and steal money from you, your family and friends. Then instagram has no way of dealing with it. They dont care about you loosing money just them gaining more"
Instagram removed the images permission button. Instagram removed the images permission button. They make it really hard to edit photos permitted for Instagram access. It means they are trying to force the user to give full access to all images. Why? Why Instagram wants to see all the images I\'ve taken in my entire life. That\'s so unethical and dirty.  That\'s just pure spying on people. No trust left for Facebook
Privacy policy. Why yall need to know what BATTERY PERCENTAGE OUR DEVICE IS ON????? Like goddamn
Motivated by Greed and No Respect to Users. I grant you need to make money but that should not come at expense of users loss of privacy. Users should have the right to protect their information and privacy. Users should be treated to the extent they agree to be so treated
"Doesnt even deserve 1 star. Very biased and dont allow people to express their freedom of speech. Politically influenced, Facebook silenced those who are oppressed and promotes those who are criminal oppressors. They save all your data and sell it, sell your information and then use it against you, try to control you way you think, eat, sleep, feel and what you believe through all the advertisements. They even record you whilst your speaking, then you see advertisements pop up of what you just spoke about, extremely creepy. Its like a cancer, avoid at all costs. They have proven to support apartheid and genocide"
"NO PRIVACY RIGHTS. The terms of service takes all your rights to privacy away They can take anything from your phone, photos, messages, searches...everything because you are giving them the rights to Your private messages Wake up"
"Read the TOS. IG steals all you data, pics you upload belong to them, they can hijack your network and even access data of other devices on your WiFi... Legally"
Major privacy infringements. Fed up terms and conditionswhat valid justification do you have for spying on your users?
"Gone way downhill. I have had an Instagram account since the time it first came out and its changed so much since this. It used to be safe from ads and bots and now, most of the app is bots and businesses constantly inundating you ads and spam messages. I hate that they keep changing the layout of the notifications. Why cant you look at your likes and follow requests from your actual profile? Its a pain in the butt to have to go back to your feed every time you want to look at notifications; I dont care about shopping, I just want to be able to see my personal notifications. And for god sake, PLEASE fix the algorithm. Im so tired of only seeing business accounts and influencers and not my friends. The fact that Instagram is not in chronological order anymore is ridiculous and I barely use it anymore because I start scrolling and it takes forever to catch up, I still miss my friends posts and then like halfway through the feed, it refreshes and I have to start all over again. Also, I have to like every picture 3 times in order for it to stay. It keeps undoing it and its not an issue with wifi or service"
Censors users and shares propaganda. Ads are also almost always scams to steal your financial info
"Really good. After a little while, once its algorithm finds out what it should recommend to you, Instagram is very enjoyable. Who knows who that data is going to though"
Cool app. Get to archive life. Get to be updated about peoples lives whether they are close to me or celebrities. Privacy is adequate. Allowed to communicate with multiple people or one to one. Good app
Service. Too many ads. And too many requests from people I do not know. How do they get my info when I am a private account. I opened a ticket to complain and check to see if I have been hacked or an account has been set up using my photo. No response. No phone number to call  Awful service
"Editing profile & new policy. First off I wanna talk about is editing your profile. In order to change your name (not username) you have to wait two weeks just to change it. Which is absolutely ridiculous, Its not even your username. Its just your name in your bio.And second of all the new policies is actually illegal. Youll see us through our cameras and mic? Thats invasion of privacy and actually disgusting. Change these two and everyone will actually start liking instagram more"
"« IG Génération. Instagram is the real revolution of our generation. It empowered the individual. It cuts barriers, preconceptions and blablabla  Insta Generation P.S.: Lets have a option of a post only a personalized audience can see. Not only for privacy, but to make it possible to target specific audience"
"My Instagram Acct. I very much appreciate &amp; Love my IG Account. I have given a 4 Star, rather then a 5. Due to the unforeseen hassles, I experienced as a newbie. Strangers harrassing me for money. And, stalkers looking through my page, to take advantage of me. This is not acceptable. By the same token, I understand IG does respect its users. And, does all they can to rectify any grievances. If other IG users, would respect what others have written on there profile. Then maybe there wouldnt be so much mistrust in the IG community. It is sad for me too have to keep my page private. Because, of all these other nuisances &amp; issues. And, the world in which we live leaves you unprotected if you are not aware of the unsafe predators who are out for self gain. Neither the less, I am very grateful for my IG Page. Cause, basically it is my only safe social media space. Facebook does not have the privacy options available as IG has. I do not use Twitter. Thank-You,Instagram I Lové You..."
"Manipulates your attention. Beware they have optimised this app to keep your attention. Its nothing more nowadays than 25/35 year olds doing the same dance/lip sync to the same meme music/voiceover. Theres no quality or substance. Messages are not encrypted for privacy, meaning Instagram (and Facebook) can read them. Its just a pseudo TikTok dating app hybrid"
False information. Instagram is filled with insane levels of antivaxxers and anti science- and they dont seem to actually do anything about reports for false information or scams/fraud
"WAY too many ads now and CREEPY tracking. They have been increasing the number of ads over the years to the point that now every 4th post is an ad. It&#39;s 25% ads in your feed. Plus they track everything you do outside of Facebook &amp; Instagram so you get a lot of creepily personal ads. (I&#39;m not paranoid, it&#39;s true, look it up.) Any personal issue you&#39;ve looked up on the web, I can guarantee you it&#39;s in your ad profile at Facebook headquarters. Instagram used to be fun, pleasant way to kill time before Facebook got its hands on it, but FB&#39;s greed and penchant for spying has ruined it. Deleted the app. I&#39;m done"
Hacking/ bad reports. Hacking friends accounts and going on my  and trying to get my friends to try to invest in things that are fake to get information to get into their accounts to do the same as they did to my friend. Ive reported a few times and my friends account is @ShaeQuae and she would never ask me to do anything other then to play video games or how I am doing health wise. I do love Instagram but maybe youve noticed Ive stopped posting as much the last few years. 
Stop being nosey. Would of gotten a higher score but even with the app as locked down as I have it it still pulls too much information from places outside my app. Not entirely shocked bc it is owned by Facebook but I stopped using Facebook over two years ago bc of the privacy concerns. I guess maybe Ill tell Instagram to F-off next if they dont get those algorithms fixed. Also they dont do nearly enough to squash some of the BS on the platform... step it up Instagram
"I am not data. I am more than my likes, dislikes, interactions and opinions online. I have a desire for seeing and bringing out the good in the world. I believe people have the ability to change perspectives and dont fit into an algorithm. Whats seen through my camera - my body, my kids and my home and habits should be a salvation for private connection and basic human needs - not a business opportunity. I am not data"
needs work for privacy. - when i put a profile picture it becomes blurry- i cant delete a specific photo in a post i made with multiple pictures- i cant block people from seeing who im following in a public account- people post drugs and inappropriate posts on instagram and instagram doesnt take it down knowing kids use this app- someones using my name and impersinating me so i reported it and instagram hasnt done anything- i dint want to be showed in people suggestions but instagram doesnt have an option for that- instagram removed to button where you can choose not to show up when people type your username in the search bar
You should get it. Instagram is a great app to connect with family and friends keep up with the latest gossip on celebrities even getting some simple recipes and life hacks however I think it has a bug both my account which I had for many years all the sudden decided that I wasnt going to be able to get notifications I tried everything from seeing if my phone is the problem and looking if my notifications are on on the app and on my phone and they are on I had this problem for a couple of months now (it started in April) and I even tried contacting Instagram via email and I still havent had a response I would love to give Instagram the 5 stars it deserves but I feel cheated because I dont get any notifications which is a huge bummer when I dont even know if someone texted me because I dont get anything I even tried on other phones and nothing I even deter them app I just hope Instagram sees this and tries to fix the problem on my account
Whats wrong?. All my friends and I are mad because Instagram doesnt load over cellular data
Bias Application. A very Bias application that takes sides for political reasons. I would definitely move away from it as I do not feel free to express my opinion nor do I feel free sharing my data
Account Got Hacked - Privacy Breach. My account got hacked and the person got access to my phone number. There is no way to contact an actual person at Instagram and their help page is useless. Do not download the app unless you are fine with your private information potentially being compromised
They steal ur information   And it dranes battery  it will not allow conservative q. This app is censored you cant not speake about the China virus or the 2o2o election it also steals ur data and sells it to China
"Instagram is great but needs to improve their security checks. I have been on Instagram for since before 2011 and have loved everything about it. However just yesterday, my account was hacked and I just have to say, the access to support needs to be improved. First, getting an email notice saying your email and password have been changed should have include a confirmation that I authorized this feature and the link should be active for at least a 24 hours before you accept the change. I received emails of this change during my working hours so I did not check my personal email for merely less than two hours after discovering the automated email notification links saying if this is not you please click has expired. This would prevent so many people from getting their accounts hacked and unable to recover due to the lack of a chat support team or feature like this. I have emailed Facebook, IG, and did the video selfie thing that has not been successful thus far. Please improve your customer support so that these hackers have less room to violate peoples identities and keep the original owners safer from these attempts. Its absolutely ridiculous all the hoops you have to jump through. Or another $$ idea: maybe require photo identification to create your IG account so that you can match drivers licenses or other forms of government ID with peoples profiles"
"Requesting filtering features. I follow business pages (restaurants) on Instagram, itd be great to have a filter that would allow users to distinguish between regular user/influencer pages from business pages. Itd be best for  users can to choose the type of business: wellness, retail, hospitality, restaurant, cafe, etc in order to find the page they are looking for. Right now, it difficult to find those pages when I search the following section. We dont even have the option of sorting the list in alpha order.This is especially problematic bc many times I follow pages of places I want to visit in the future, yet when that time comes, its difficult to track it down bc Im following thousands of accounts. I found a workaround: use Google maps and save it as a place I want to visit. Since I found the place on IG Im naturally inclined to search for it within the app instead. I would prefer not using a third app to track the places I want to visit"
"Boycott IG. IG continues to participate in discriminatory censorship practices regarding sex workers, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+ folks, fat folks, and disabled folks while illegally accessing data (I.e. current lawsuit addressing illegal camera access). The app has steadily declined over the past few years after no longer serving its users and instead data mining for advertisers. As someone who has used IG through the duration of existence, the removal of the chronological newsfeed and the addition of ads has seriously reduced the quality of my experience. These modifications have bastardized what was good about social media, and quite frankly I cannot continue to overlook them"
STUPID APP. Idiots FIX your app. Locked me out of my profile that I was actively using for not providing my personal phone number??? WHAT ??? Why would you need my personal phone number when you have my email verified already??? Is that not enough stalking for you idiots? You need more to provide for third party money that you leech daily by selling our personal information to third party??? Respect the sense of PRIVACY would you. Wont return to this IDIOT app. Money hungry idiots.There needs to be a VERY STRICT law so that these biased social media platforms cannot interfere in political manners in any way or form. I hope twitter and Instagram lose its liability shield and faces its consequences as of the new social media executive order. Its about time. These Fact Checkers are nothing but a bunch of wolves in sheeps clothing. Instagram I sincerely hope and pray that your evil corporation will be going down along with Twitter and other biased networks. They arent a social platform anymore theyre a political agenda. The time is near. It shows that satan is at work but Remember so is GOD  GOD wins no matter what
"Not the same anymore. Instagram is not the same anymore. I understand that the time goes on so the world and technology will advance with it, however, Instagram turned into an app where you measure your self esteem by likes and followers. Where users and businesses, you dont even follow are constantly showing up on your page. Where there is no privacy.   I have a personal, private page. So why am I always seeing ads and sponsored pictures. If I wanted to follow or connect with them, I wouldve used the search bar. I already have a business page, please separate the two. Everything is lifestyle, image, opinions and sell sell sell. Its like the idea of this modern Instagram is based on one persons thinking of how the world should be.   Technology is amazing creation, seeing how much we could share yet its funny no one ever sees what were saying"
"Enjoy, but with concerns. I enjoy Instagram yet have grave concerns about Big Tech tracking every click and like.  Feels Orwellian like 1984.  Please stop data mining"
Privacy and Apple violation. Got an ad today in app that the only way that could have had that info was scanning my email or another app. I only access IG on this phone so they definitely are up to illegal spying of my activity. Apple needs to block this
"Instagram is dead to me. What happened to this app, everything about it has changed over the years. I do not agree with IGs new terms of service one bit, giving them consent to so much more of our personal information, this is going to far. Big data and big tech are out of control"
"Illegal background activity. Instagram has been illegally activating the microphone and camera on iOS. Doesnt matter which version of app or iOS. This data is shared between advertisers without your permission. This happens across FB, IG, and any app this is using their api"
Info. Doesnt show the right information for accounts/profiles
"Enough with the Scams and Spam and Copyright Violations. Where on earth is the vaunted Meta AI when it comes to Instagram? My posts instantly draw spam comments to submit to accounts that stay active forever as if they are somehow not responsible for the botnets that promote them. Scammers steal other users content and pelt us with their attempts to steal fromus and nothing is ever done. Content moderators have milliseconds to judge violations and frequently decide that bold theft of personal content is just fine, thank you very much. I could code things to prevent half of this quite easily and Im not an expert at fraud prevention, I am quite sure you have experts on this to whom you are not listening. Fix this. You are letting your platform eat itself"
"Camera and mic on all the time. Last updates forces instagram to have camera and mic open at all times. Moreover, when pressing the volume button it will start recording/capturing a picture straightaway, stopping you from doing whatever else youre doing on instagram.Not only there will be (more) battery drain and (more) privacy concerns, but also you released a buggy version. Congratulations on nothingThis stinks of Facebook"
"Newest Update is One No One Asked For. Instagram claims to bring you closer to your friends through photos. With this update, that could not be further from the truth. Theyve decided to prioritize ad revenue and shopping. I have both a personal and business account. The menu isnt even consistent on them now. My engagement on my small art business account has dropped to half even though Im posting reels. Revert this app to why we loved it, to chronologically see what our friends are up to"
"Best for Business & Personal. Simple, easy to use, I prefer it to other social media platforms. More customer service options is the only criticism right now"
"NO PROTECTION FOR YOUR INSTAGRAM  SUPPORTERS. ACCOUNTS GET HACKED &amp; YOU DONT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT WAYS TO ACTUALLY REPORT THESE SITUATIONSHAVE VALID INFO ABOUT TGE GACKER, BUT HAVE NO INSTAGRAM SUPPORT TO GIVE IT TOTHE HAVKER THEN BECOMES SUCCESSFULYOU GIVE PLENTY OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT DONT PAN OUT TO FILE ACTUAL COMPLAINTSSTRONGLY THINKING ABOUT SPREADING THE WORD &amp; BOYCOTTING YOUR PLATFORM"
Connectivity. Both a business and personal interactional app with a solid algorithm is what makes Instagram the genesis of digital global real time reach in delivering beauty in pictures from all perspectives. Then...what you can do with that
"Exploitive and money grabbing. I understand, because theyre now owned by Facebook, Instagram has to find a way to exploit peoples privacy and information. I came to terms that everything I do with the app open is sent to advertisers and shady parts of the internet in the attempt to make a quick buck. In addition, This previous update has really tossed Instagram down the toilet. The addition of reels, which nobody asked for, is an annoying feature, and even less people use. Despite that, the reels tab takes up 20% of the bottom of the screen, along with the even more useless shop tab. Ive never once opened the shop tab, and never will. Instagram pushed all of their normal functions, like the new post and activity buttons up into one corner of one tab, called the normal tab. Instagram pushes a progressive agenda and silences/calls false information on anything that the IG executives dont like. I wont be using Instagram much more, but because of its purposefully addictive setup, Im doing my best at quitting completely, but still working on it"
"R.I.P. The way that Facebook has taken over every aspect of instagram is very upsetting. Once a place where art creativity and individually was welcome, you are now overrun by adds of all kinds and overpowered by the stats that now control visibility of posts. What you are left with is essentially another Facebook which is soul sucking and quite frankly has way too much power over personal information. Thank you Facebook for ruining our privacy, our overall mentality and the one website made for artists"
"Do not use this. Very bad app it is good social media app but it also automatically follows many people and accounts without your acknowledgment its like theres no privacy of your account, worst app"
They dont care about your safety  Help center not helpful. Its been a week and a half that my Instagram was hacked I received the email that my email had been changed and I click the link and it pretty much sent me to help center  I received a recovery code later on in the day so when I went back to log in I didnt have that option anymore to dial in the recovery code so now by this time the hacker took my phone number off the account so all my login links go to the hackers email and I no longer have access to the account he is using my videos and pictures to promote an illegal scam writing my whole freinds list  I reported the email the phone number even tried to go to local authorities and their is nothing they can do and told me good luck getting thru Instagram Till this day this hacker is still using my account that I reported countless times I even tried sending my picture with my id and I got nothing back  No access no deactivating nothing its still up and running with my memories and pictures and videos and all Instagram is not safe at all  I wont stop till its deleted
INSTA-AD More garbage ads than following content. Your personal feed is filled with more sponsored ads and similar accounts than actual accounts that you follow. It is insanely disproportionate and makes the app absolutely worthless. Do not get it unless you want to mindlessly scroll through ads
Update. Im done with Instagram. Officially deleting app. I read the new update and we are agreeing to allow Instagram to have full access to our phones 24/7. They can monitor us and we agree not to sue over violation of privacy. This is ridiculous to have an app do this
"You are the product. You are the product, where your data is used and sold. Advertisements are non-stop, every other couple of posts there are the most annoying ads.Instagram truly has become unusable. Time to switch to a product that doesnt consider you the product and blast a billion ads in your face constantly"
"A great place, regardless of why. Personal or business it doesnt matter Instagram is a way to contact those who you wish to contact call simply have fun while youre doing it"
"No stars. Do not trust Instagram. They give no cares about your private security. I was hacked through Instagram and a lot of personal info and private pictures were exploited. They never helped me. I had to do all the work to secure my account and when I reported the problem I was never given any proper services to help stop the  perpetrators. They gave me the run around. Facebook is connected and they were more helpful but I recommend you stay far away from Instagram. I. Demented my account and even that was a hassle. Beware, they really dont care about their security"
Privacy issue. It would have five stars. But I have my account and posts set to private and Im still getting people I dont know liking my recent pics. My privacy is important to me and thats why I rarely post anything
"do not install this app. Do not use Instagram. Someone hacked my account, set up two step verification to some number, and now I cant get in anymore. Called, emailed, complained to Instagram, nobody ever called or emailed back to help me out. Nobody in that horrible company cares about the fact that some random person has the access to my private photos, and I cant do anything about it. So whatever you post there, you better be ready for the whole world being able to use your stuff. Otherwise Instagram people will NEVER help you out"
"Coming along. If my information is passed on without my permission or signature, you will be sued. No questions asked. But if you maintain mutual respect and keep my best interest at hand- Privacy. We will have no issues, any one wants to see my folder or check in on me has to so by the judicial system, never is my information to be given to a third party, as use of the consumers act"
"Misleading. When Instagram does their updates, I feel as though users arent usually considered. The algorithm has affected my TL so much on my personal and business. What I see on my feed is usually limited to only a select few accounts - usually business ones and Im unaware of how I can change this. Secondly, I feel that they need to be more descriptive when new version updates are out, I recently updated the app as it there was no mention of feature updates - just bug improvements and performance. And I must admit, I hate the fact that they have moved the activity tab. Its such an inconvenience and I dont care about shop"
"NO SUPPORT FROM INSTAGRAM. So I describe Instagram as the wild Wild West, because their seems to be rules and policies that doesnt come in to play when u actually need it to. Eg. My main Instagram account that Ive had since 2013 with most of my elementary/ high school friends was hacked, they ended up messaging my friends acting as myself to be able to exploit them of their Bitcoins and money to so call invest. My friend hasnt seen that money ever again.. they blocked him after. Not to mention they went in my archives and posted pictures of myself.. making it seem like its me posting. Also they have changed my name several times so its harder to find the account- their latest user name change - @lisa_fx_trader__co and theirs lots of accounts that starts off similarly. So basically theyve been doing this and getting away with it, their is no direct line to reach Instagram - useless support ( NO BODY REACHED OUT, CONTACTED ME BACK AND NO RESPONSE TO MY MESSAGES) One of their policy says if someone is posting as u its enough to shut them down. At this point can I sue the company?? because all of this is causing emotional distress, someone committing fraud with my face posting my pics. Took money from ppl I actually know in real life so yes they knew where to find me to ask  why did you do that to me until I explain it wasnt me And Instagram is probably in on it. Who knows at this point. Your better off using another platform - ones that are more secure and responsive. Ones with an actual support team that cares about all its users. Because Instagram turning into a FRAUD/ SCAM FEAST and itll probably get worse over time because by then theyll be better at manipulating their way around the policy"
"Support staff is a joke, overall a fine app. Ive been using Instagram for some time now. Originally there were a lot less things in place to protect users but thats starting to change, slowly. One huge complaint I have is the lack of support staff. If you have a problem you can check the website but thats about it. Nobody is there to help you if your account gets hacked or you lose access to it. ( Unless youre a celebrity of course. ) Its addictive like most social media and I highly recommend fact checking things, as fact checkers rarely get the job done right. Lots of bots and spam accounts but those are everywhere on the internet. Its important to take breaks from it. Its a nice tool for connecting with people you otherwise wouldnt be able to connect with. Great way to share photos with friends. Wouldnt recommend giving young children access to this app but I cant stop you"
They listen to you. This app and the algorithm it uses has been known to listen to my phone conversations and suggests ads and things that my friends tell me they like but I dont. I used it to look at memes and doggo videos
The Best Social Media. I love everything about IG. Since day 1 on 2009 I began in this media with my personal account and later opened my business profile and it's been the best to work with. Has a lot of features to use and including the Reels button was the BEST EVER HAPPENED 
"Issues. The censorship of Instagram is ridiculous. Someone needs to review what chooses to get censored or not. There are so many posts of personal friends and pages I follow, that get censored for no apparent reason. I have reported pages of people being blatantly racist, threatening people, causing harm to people, etc.  that comes back saying it does not infringe on any guidelines. At the same time I have friends who are artist whos posts get censored almost instantly. Besides the terrible and inconsistent censoring, the current algorithm is terrible. Its very obvious that this app is now mainly a place to sell products and run ads. I barley see any of my friends posts timely, but I get ads and market place posts repeatedly. More and more people are leaving Instagram and I understand why. Its a cash grab at this point and ads and businesses bring in the most money, seeing art and personal friends posts are not. There is a reason many of us left Facebook and it was because it was turning into ad central and no longer focused on the users and connection, now Instagram is exactly the same. Hoping things can be resolve eventually but it seems like with every update it gets worse and worse"
"This app tracks you. Just like Facebook, this app tracks you"
Hacked. My account was hacked. They changed the email address and password so I have no way of accessing my account. Instagram and Facebook have been no help in getting this problem fixed
No privacy. Vous naurez aucune vie privée à cause de cette application qui vend vos informations et qui vous écoute
"Translation has bugs. Update - 05/26/20 My profile is private, yet Im still being tagged in photos that have nothing to do with me and the posting profiles either advertise an outside link to a porn site, or another profile that does. Instagram needs to give users control over who can tag them, either requesting permission for every attempt, completely on or off by others, or with tiered levels of access (only me, friends, friends of friends, everyone, etc.) Im typically on Instagram often enough to see the new tags, but for the period of time Im not, someone close to me might see this ridiculous tag and associate me as a willing participant. Needs a fix.Update-11/30/19 (fixed)Instagram is not allowing profile photo changes, stating that Im not connected to the internet despite my scrolling through the suggested feed and refreshing what they want me to see without any problems.Update- 10/14/19Instagram seems to be showing more more ads than ever, and choosing ads from all over the country instead of using my photo locations as a way to target appropriate content without me needing to add a Facebook page to allow even more access to personal data.Also, when I ask for a post to be translated, it occasionally translates into a variety of languages. Im an English speaker, and my preferred language is set to English, but with the latest update, I see translation into Chinese, Turkish or Spanish, so far. None of which I speak or are in the OP comment.Old review-What do I mean? When browsing through suggested content, Im constantly seeing content from individuals talking about their current high school life; be it social life, academics or JROTC. Request people volunteer their age or DOB on personal pages so we can filter out content from sources we dont want to hear from due to a lack of life experience.Also, the ability to filter out specific influencer, politician or any other kind of grayed-out label would be perfect"
New privacy terms. The new privacy terms are creepy. Access to photos and cameras even when I am not using the app? No thank you
"ADS. Ads, ads, ads Nothing but adsAs if selling our info and data wasnt enough, now greedy Zuckerberg sells your screen time. This app is spearheading the downfall of the information era"
"Support terrorist. It collects data and support the terrorist of Israel. This guy had the audacity to take apple to court because he cannot collect no more date. Also he filtered so many pro Palestine campaign. He supposed to murderers and the tourist of Israel. Social media meant to be freedom of speech, we should be able to Voice our opinion"
"Great app, but theres one thing. I was going through my profile cleaning up my followers and the accounts that I follow and got a notification about my account activity. Apparently, there is a limit on how much activity you can do before Instagram tells you that youve done too much. Really wish that could be changed - Ive had too many spam and scammer accounts following me through accounts I approved and would like to minimize the risk of having my photos/account info taken"
"Stop focusing on ad revenue and focus on the user experience. All we want and have been asking for is for our feeds to appear in chronological order like they used to. Instead you guys ignore the number 1 request of the users since you dont care about what we as app users want, you care about ad revenue and making money for yourself and collecting our data. so you put the buttons that we need to engage with our feed and followers up in a corner that we cant reach easily and replace it with shopping buttons... when I wanna go shopping Im not gonna open up the Instagram app to do my shopping. Stop trying to force your greediness. It makes the app extremely unenjoyable"
Zuckerberg is violating our privacy. FIX THE PRIVACY POLICY
"Degenerates. This app is full of bots that either repost everything from other platforms or steal from fellow content creators on the platform. The fact that this app is chocked full of bots that try to steal your information is indicative of the principals of this app falling to the wayside, it seems as though as soon as they were bought out by Facebook they lost their moral compass and allow for content that never would have been allowed under the original IG"
"Didnt get full features of app. Dear IG developers,I have been using IG since 2014 and one of the loyal customer that I feel like instagram have more privacy than facebook. Even I have been using for long, I feel disappointed some how that I didnt get update features like update messenger features which others have been using since you had launched. I reported about my problem and dm to you multiple times but no feedback. Hope you could fix it and very soon.I am waiting for the day to explore the update features very soonThanks and regards,Jilly"
Algorithm. why is it that occasionally instagram thinks its cool to just ignore my personal interests and show me stuff thats popular in my country and my feed is replaced with uninteresting garbage. please remove this. im tired of it
"Evil app. Using Facebook services: whatsapp, facebook, instagram means you are giving up your privacy. They could give you ads of things you just discuss with your friends verbally (the apps listen your conversation), or from your chat in whatsapp or your cookies in the browsers. Just be careful, they are really persistent giving you the ads about things they think you need. Avoid at all"
A politically biased app. That doesnt respect privacy at all
"Unnecessary Changes. Instagram is doing entirely too much. Removing story view counts, like numbers, time/date things were posted....like why? People who are building brands &amp; data-oriented people like myself use these features to gain insight for future posts and stories as well. How can we grow if you keep removing the USEFUL tools and adding stupid things nobody needs or asked for? Instagram is doing the most &amp; quickly becoming annoying to even use"
Hacked Instagram. Yall really need to work on recovering accounts my account got hacked the person is using my personal photos pretending to be me and contacting everyone I kno trying to scam them and Ive reported them my family and friends have reported them but Instagram is doing nothing about it thats my personal information and I get the feeling Instagram doesnt care so whats the point of having a report option if its not getting handled if yall are just gonna allow it to happen and do nothing how are users supposed to feel comfortable knowing someone can hack their account and they never be able to to use it again Im not the first person this has happened to and Im definitely not the last but something has to change
"My feed. Hi Instagram, I just wanted to say about my feed right? Theres some accidental photos i put on my post. I recommend a feature where we can remove a photo from my own post if its on accident. And my post was successful but there was one ugly photo and i recommend a feature where you can Remove the photo from that specific post. I also suggest when you go to the section security and to access data. i suggest we can delete the information and data off that because its making me want to delete a new account but im gna lose all the memories and messages and my posts and followers"
"Little to no support service. The app itself is great. Ive had Instagram for years and its helped me stay connected with others and discover opportunities. Recently I cant sign into my account because I no longer have the phone number connected to it. Ive emailed support and replied to their take a picture of yourself holding a paper with a code.. stuff, and theres been no reply in weeks.Its understandable that this is a free service so there wont  be much focus on customer service, however, all of the users on Instagram are TRUSTING this app with their personal information, attention, and viewing all the ads that are displayed that Instagram makes profit off of. To be the #1 social media app in the world, that is a aspect that Instagram needs to master"
Very high Data consumption. I have been using Instagram for more than 8 years and over this month Instagram has drained my 4G and I havent been using it as much. Maybe its a glitch or flaw that they must fix as soon as possible
"Privacy breaching trash. Facebook has no morals, disgusting fraudulent digital leeches"
"The new policy. No.  Absolutely not. I dont want my photos invaded by a bunch of crazy people trying to help me find what I like Well, no. And Whats with sharing your beliefs is hate speech? What the heck is wrong with you? PERSONAL DMs SHOULD BE PERSONAL.Oh, yeah. You dont get to tell us to wear masks This is a free country, and if we get in trouble with it, fine I dont need a babysitter. Oh ALSO the little detail of you tracking our location at all times Nonsense I know youre doing this for a master plan of your own personal gain, but think of who youre hurting I urge anyone who reads this to fight to keep America free, and ourselves United as one against the evil in the world"
"Inaccurate violations and limited visibility. Its obvious that the AI/algorithms dont work and cause so many problems for people. Instagram is stifling the growth of accounts that follow the community guidelines, terms and conditions. My account has not been allowed to grow for over two years. Instead of fixing issues like this they add worthless features and change the whole app and make it more complicated to force people to stay on the app longer so they can track all of our behavior and experiences for their benefit. Instagram was amazing before Facebook changed everything"
"Remove this app from your phone. This app listens to you, tracks everything you do, is full of ads and most importantly they sell your information. Its what Facebook does. Why do you think youre getting so many spam calls and texts? Because of companies like this Dont fall for it"
facebook just keeps making it worse and worse. 1/4th of the content you see is ads. no way to limit ad tracking.  now the shopping feature is in your face so annoying. I set my screen time to 20 minutes a day and dont even get limited the app is just so annoying. I need to see what my friends post sometimes but i really just hate using it
O support if youre account is hacked. Pretty self explanatory here. 0 support from instagram if your account is hacked and all your info was changed. Followed all the non helpful help articles step by step and nothing then found a form you can fill out and send to instagram for help but yup you guessed it 0 help or support so an account I have had for years is gone and instagram wont help they do nothing to block hackers scammers and spammer so many fake accounts on this platform. But they make their millions so they do not care and there is no incentive to help those who made them rich
"Ads first, friends second. This app is nothing but ads. The stories and posts are all ads. I see more ads than stories or posts from friends and family. What a horrible app this has become. Its just a decoy to track you ever since it was bought by Facebook"

Followers tracking apps. I use an app to track who follows me and who dosnt follow me back. Instagram decided to block me from seeing who people including myself follow even though my app dosnt violate anything
"Could be much better. Constantly getting weird and unnecessary updates and features. Even more horrible censorship. Let people have opinions, the internet should be a place where people can have different ideologies and opinions. And no one is going to pay money to use Instagram just cause you want our data. Keep this up and you are going to start losing users. May I add this app is also super laggy and buggy"
"NO CONTROL OVER HACKERS. Instagram has lost total control over privacy. Instagrams process for recovering accounts is so cumbersome or non-existent, that if subjected to a hack, you will need to rely on third-party social media experts or white-hat hackers, at an additional cost to help you regain access, if lost. Instagram keeps largely silent about the issue, while thousands+ of accounts are subjected to hacking. We pour so much of ourselves into these devices and platforms either through personal details, stories shared with others, photos, etc and it is scary to find out that this bubble of security we all think we have isn't actually so private or secure in the end at all. It feels quite vulnerable and sickening. I'm sorry this is happened to myself and others, its such a roller coaster. If you choose to invest so much of yourself into this app know that at anytime a creeper or worse can take it all away from you, and you will be left defenceless and unsupported. Time and energy better served in reality"
Filtering privacy. It would be wonderful if you could filter the privacy of certain post. Instead of having to make your profile either private or not. Facebook allows your profile to be private but you can go and change a particular post to public. I would like to keep my childs pictures private but would love to be able to mingle with hashtags in certain other post. I cant do that. I have to keep my entire profile private so the hashtags are pointless
"Instagram is violating Freedom of speech. Ive been using Instagram since 2011, it is surprising that after all of its success sadly the app falls to the trap of politics and blocks the personal account of Palestinians who share their normal life struggle during the Zionists attacks on Ghazza and Palestinian lands. Shame on you, shame on you for violating even the human right to speak"
Data manipulation. to promote their own political agendas of apartheid state of isr**l
"More ads than anything else. Facebook sure knows how to ruin a platform. Its what they do best as a social media company. You will see posts from 2 days ago. Every 3 pictures there will be 3 ads. Its just horrible. Its very clear why people use other apps more. For a company that is supposed to be chief user data, they dont care about what users want. This is why each update, their apps get worse and worse"
"fun to use but unusable. I really want to use instagram but it does not work over cellular data on my phone. And yes, i have cellular data enabled for instagram. when i open the app over cellular data it usually loads 3-4 pictures and then i am unable to look at anything else. i can never look at my own profile or anyone elses. just the first few photos on my feedthis is extremely frustrating bc i do not have wifi at my house, instead i just use an unlimited data plan. this works great other than the fact that the only way i can check instagram at home is by having a family member turn their hotspot onIm the only one that i personally know with my issue, although i think ive seen others with it online. again, cellular data is already enabled for the app. i have tried deleting the app and redownloading it to no avail. i have reset my devices network settings as well (iphone xs). nothing seems to help at allplease, if you could reach out to help with this issue, as i would really like to use instagramthanks"
"No Privacy Whatsoever. I made my account with the intentions of just using it to follow a few youtubers and artists that I liked. I had no intentions of using my account for anything other than a throwaway account yet the very minute I created it (and didnt link any of my contacts to my account) I had no intentions of following anyone that I knew as I wanted to use this account for light activity. I dont even post. But as soon as I signed up, I  immediately started getting follow requests from people that I knew. Relatives, and even friends of my parents Heck, my friends sister even found my account and requested to follow me and Ive never even met her before I dont even have my real name as my username. Why must people see who were following? Why and more important HOW does everyone know that Im on Instagram. I just want to browse in peace without having to constantly explain myself to my relatives and friends. Please insert better privacy options that give you the option to hide who people follow, even friends as well as an option to be hidden from being suggested to others. PLEASE"
Download if you trust instagrams security for all your earnings in the bank. Download if you trust instagrams security for all your earnings in the bank For example my sisters instagram account was hacked and if that aint enough all of her savings were stolen from her account. And there was no indication for her being hacked in her bank account nor her email. It was simply enabled by being hacked into her instagram account Besides all this she lost her account cause she was locked out by the intruder. Which brings us to another question why instagram would rather trust a new IP address than the original IP address that created the account. Theyve got all the info there aint they? BOTTOM LINE: if you value your earnings and your privacy (from others not only instagram) DO NOT FALL INTO THIS TRAP
"Make sure you dont upload personal data. I have been using Instagram since 2012 and one day out of the blue my account is disabled. I couldnt download my pictures and they are gone forever.. While I was trying to recover my account, I realized how much time I was actually wasting using the app.. I will never use any of the Facebook products ever again"
A social media app just for looking at Ads. I dont have time to follow friends and family and find interesting people when theres things I could buy that I dont even know about. Finally someones invented a social media platform thats just for looking at ads all day long And because theyre so good at invading my privacy the ads are all super relevant
"What ??. I love Instagram and it is almost definitely the app I use the most. However, in the last day its started saying that sending photos goes against the European guidelines for privacy. Im mainly writing this to see if other people are having the same problem"
Being added to random Groups. Please give a privacy option to allow only those who we follow or followers to be allowed to invite us to an Instagram groupI have got over 50-100 requests and it is very frustrating because they are spam and random groupsAlso to prevent random people from following us
"The New Update Needs to GO. I hate this app so much now. Its bad enough all of the updates youve always made but COME ON. I do not want to buy stuff from stupid accounts that I dont even follow. I want to see PICTURES. and VIDEOS. from my FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Why, seriously in what parallel universe would I EVER want to have easier access to shop for stupid stuff rather than see my notifications on my PHOTO SHARING APP????????? What even is the point of having Instagram anymore??????? I literally think Im going to delete my account now because of this. Ive never been so angry over an app update but this is absolutely ridiculous"
Privacy issue. They controls what you want to add
"UNINSTALL IT NOW. Guys listen up Instagram is tracking your info, they see through your camera and scan you face recognition and keep it in their data. DELETE IT NOW PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAFTEY IM WARNING YOU"
"Hacked and Insta unhelpful. My personal and business account have both been hacked this week. I have contacted Instagram support numerous times to a generic computerised response which states log in and report I dont think they are understanding I have been hacked so I am no longer in control of my Instagram to be able to log in to report.What is worse I have been hacked by someone who has been messaging all my followers pretending to be me to con them out of money Again Instagram has been extremely unhelpful with helping me report and try to put a stop to innocent people being conned out of money. I have sent Instagram multiple screen shots of these conversations of the hacker pretending to be me messaging friends and family, yet again a unhelpful computerised response on how to log in (when I can no longer log in as hacker has changed the email on the account, so I can not change passwords etc).I have even asked that if they can not help me gain back access to my accounts then I would rather my account be deleted than someone else have access to all my images and messages etc. So they are able to con peopleSurprise, surprise they can not help with this either The stress and time this has caused me and my family and friends is ridiculous. I have been unable to reach any sort of complaints department for Instagram. Instagram you should be truly ashamed However, if you have celebrity status then they can get your account back for youThis they have time for and are willing to help someone of high public status"
"Instagram is my favourite social media. I have been on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter for a long time but I am more comfortable to use Instagram for personal use and helping my audience, thank you for keep improving the app with cool features "
Privacy. I think there should be an option like Facebook to where you can choose who you want to look at your post and who you can hid it from
Privacy Concern. Instagram privacy protection in users account is weak and easy to hack. I faced the problem multiple times.I dont recommend you all to upload this vulnerable app
"F**k Facebook. Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, stop selling are data Your going to lose. Time to jump to the new platform"
"Video views. I dont understand how you can see who viewed your Instagram story, but you cant see who viewed your posted video on your personal page. Why cant I see who viewed my video and you just give me a number of viewers? It doesnt make sense, I want to know who viewed my videos. Can you put that feature back please?"
"It Knows My Info. So, this isnt really a review as much as a typed note put out into the open, this is my story. I was in a call with a friend last night, a service call, and were talking about how his dad is a mayor, his dad is mayor of the town we live in, and next day I saw his dad in my people I might know, note, hes never even been mentioned to me on Instagram until the phone call we discussed it, the phone call... NOT. THROUGH. INSTAGRAM"
"Advertising machine. Addictive, irritating, and clearly designed only to push me ads. Messaging is a pain and Facebook wants my data more than they want to make a good app. Monopolists stealing ideas from other apps"
Decent. Was using Instagram for a while now and just recently started having a lot of network issues or no loading results when Im connected to wifi and cellular data. Also I havent been able to go Live Stream in a couple months all because of one post that Supposedly went again the guidelines. Would really like to address those 2 issues
"Time to delete. I rarely used it, and now as I see how much \personal data\ is being collected, it is time to delete for good"
"Delete This App They Allow Hackers. After years of being on Instagram my account was hacked and locked me out of my own account. The hacker has used my account to spam and hack my friends META/Facebook/Instagram does nothing to fix this problem. I have 9141 posts from my family, my cancer battle, and recently my mothers passing and her cancer battle and they are all stolen. You should be ashamed of yourselves that you allow this to happen and do nothing to help those that have made your platform successful"
Why IG?. It allows you to develop content and grow as a brand. It is less personal than FB but allows you to present a personality. It is more a magazine
Targeted ads prey on your insecurities. Facebook/ig has so much data on me that most of my targeted ads are about things Im insecure about.I get that advertising is all about making you feel inadequate but fbs algorithm takes it to another level for me
"Instagram is the best way to connect with a relevant online audience and community. IG is great for personal and business use Social is revolutionising the way we do business, interact and express creativity "
No point downloading an app that spies on u. Facebook should have the right to own this app
Personal Brand Photoshoot. Instagram is the perfect social media platform for my business Prestige Etiquette and Image Consulting to visually display my business brand and the brands of my clients. A picture and video is worth a thousand of words
Mark Zuckerberg is a commie. I will not support anything you use to spy o people in their day to day lives. Being as the two whistle blowers came out against Facebook and revealed what you actually are doing behind the scenes with people information 0 stars is to high a rating. If people were smart they would uninstall anything that is created on behalf of anything Facebook or Twitter. You commie pricks
Hm. Why I can&#39;t download and delete the instagram data from my phone. Like it&#39;s not letting me download it and delete it off my phone. Please instagram do something about it
"F I X  N O T I F I C A T I O N S  P L E A S E. Why bother to use a social media app that refuses to give me notifications? No notifications means i dont bother opening the app until weeks later, only to find a long list of notifcations i never received. I have gone above and beyond for MONTHS to try to find and fix the reason behind why I stopped getting notifcations AS SOON AS FACEBOOK TOOK OVER THE COMPANY.I have;-Checked that all my notifcations are on inside the app AND outside on my phones settings-deleted the app entirely making sure to clear my cache in case theres a glitch-logged in and out of instagram after restarting my phone inbetween-have sent requests to instagram as well as bug reports in order to try to see whats wrong with my account and have gotten 0 responses. My account is linked to my phone number and email address too.FIX THIS. PLEASE. I get notifications for every other app on my phone except instagram"
"User-Unfriendly Update, Losing Genuineness. I dont even know if support reads these reviews but Im just going to go all in. Instagram is making it difficult for genuine users to utilize their app, and they are trying to diversify their scope of product while failing to preserve the essence of this app.  Isnt instagram designed to share personal moments and cherished memories? The removal of the activity button and replacing it with the shopping tab is a horrendous choice. Why does shopping take precedence over activity on the bottom tabs? Why make it harder to for users to see their own engagements on their own posts by squishing it un-intuitively to the upper right? This destroyed the allure of the pop up red notifications when one received activity on their posts. Furthermore, seeing ads every two to three posts on the feed is frustrating. If I accidentally like an advertisement mistaking it for a friends post, it pops up EVERYWHERE.While instagram is a platform for branded content, what made social media influencing on the app so successful was that it felt personal when someone suggested a product on their feed. Now with shopping and ads thrown into the integrity of the app design, the whole thing seems so artificial and fake, as though influencing and consumption is being shoved down our throats. Branded content will become favored because it will push for purchasing through the IG app. Users who want to share a pic to friends and family of Mom on her 65th birthday dinner will be forgotten. IGyou cannot be Tik Tok, Amazon, and IG all at once. Dont spread yourself so thin, youll lose substance. And stay loyal to your genuine users"
"Instagram is heavily inspired by 1984. HUGE INVASION OF PRIVACY Look at their newest privacy policy and youll think youre reading 1984 by George Orwell. If youve never read the book, read it before downloading this app. Dont support awful companies like Instagram and Facebook. Seriously- lets try some of the other social media apps like Parlor. I deleted Instagram today after reading their outrageous privacy update. Oh and fact checkers need to be checked :) censoring doctors and well done studies because it doesnt fit their agenda? Evil and unAmerican"
"They dont take reports seriously. Ive had multiple accounts with Instagram for nearly 10 years now. Everything has gone smoothly up until this point. So many accounts are being hacked by bitcoin and cashapp hackers. When these accounts are reported, nothing is done. Ive reported multiple accounts that have been hacked and multiple accounts that are the hackers themselves and each time Im told there is no issue. On a more personal level, I myself have not been hacked. However, I have not been able to like anyones pictures for 4 days now. Each time I try a little box comes up that says we limit how often you can do things on Instagram, like liking, to protect our community I havent done anything wrong I never spam like, as I know thats annoying. Ive reported this MULTIPLE times over the course of 4 days and have never gotten a response. How are they keeping the community safe by not letting me like my loved ones pictures but hundreds of people are getting hacked every day? Im giving 3 stars because this is the only real issue Ive had with Instagram in almost a decade, but I am not happy with them at this moment and have considered deleting my accounts"
Make STORY PRIVACY AND POST PRIVACY Customizable. Please consider making story privacy and post privacy customizable like Facebook
Satanic company. These men and women are censoring too much. They spy on your instagram activity (the things u look at) real time and cached. They use your camera to see the environment around you. There is nothing private about instagram. When you install it they spy on you and those around you
Breach of privacy. As instagram will not allow you to disable your account when ever you like or as much as you like just so they can keep users active on their platform is a breach of user agreement and privacy you you cannot restrict users to disable their account only once every 10 days is absolutely unacceptable by law you need to provide users that option if they want or need to they can and you need to put that option in your app as well instead of trying to make it as hard as you like for them to disable their account eg. having to go to a browser or log onto their computers to do so this should be straight forward and with in app usage just like Facebook If not this is forcing users you stay active when they dont want to or if its a danger to them I will be starting a court case against instagram if this option is not provided or available in the very near future if I dont want to have my account active and wants to disable my account I should have every right to do this
"Where do I begin...?. Slow, Censoring, Chronological, and Algorithms 1. Stories have been loading slow (sometimes not at all) for nearly one full year now; doesnt matter if Im on a WiFi connection or using data. 2. Instagram being purchased by Facebook (whenever that happened) was a mistake; its being eaten up by the You Cant Say That It Offends Me club.3. I want to see posts in my feed as they happen, not as Instagram deems them worthy to appear. Doing away with that was a mistake.4. Algorithms. Those need to disappear"
REMOVE ACCESS DATA SETTING PLEASE . PLEASE REMOVE THE FEATURE INSTAGRAM PLEASE OR LET US DELETE IT ANY HACKER CAN SEE WHAT YOUVE DONE OR ANY PERSON THAT GOES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT LIKE HAVENT YOU GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ????? CAN YOU PLEASE REMOVE IT FROM INSTAGRAM""
"Stop taking our personal information. Instagram had an update a little while ago that said that they have full access to ALL photos, texts, and videos. They also own your business name and artwork. Thats just creepy and evil. I would get rid of it, but as an artist it is hard for my work to get noticed. And its also hard to find another platform to display my artwork. The point is, I wouldnt recommend getting an Instagram account. Unless youre an artist and NEED to promote your artwork"
Gave out person info. Ive had multiple issues with Instagram. First off they always suspend my account and say I shared it with someone else and Ive done nothing of the sort. (They do this and fix it 2 times a week since I got insta) AND THEN my boyfriend was looking at my account and there was a thing that said email or text which I NEVER said put my personal info out and yet Instagram did
"World\'s Crappiest Algorithm App. Ad spamming, broken notifications, absolute no customer service, unknown suspensions, riddled with bots, no camera privacy, harassment to confirm email, not kept chronologial, poor resolution upload, invasion of privacy, sells your data, greedy fat cats and much more. There&#39;s literally NO reason to support such a trash app. I also find it very interesting how they&#39;re always having &#34;bug fixes updates&#34; yet literally nothing changes. It actually ends up worse. Extremely shady and flat out illegal practices here. Please ditch this &#34;service&#34;, people It&#39;s long overdueEdit: You can&#39;t even search up anything and if you do it MUST be conveniently put in the &#34;explore&#34; page with those reels and live feeds or whatever, and the algorithm puts on top random products to shop with a shopping tab. Nobody comes on IG to shop and now they&#39;re forcing users to to use this like QVC/HSN. It&#39;s not about your own customized feeds anymore, it&#39;s about what can they get to sell you. Either your time, attention, or wallet, you have to manually search up who you want to see now. The &#34;all caught up&#34; checkmark comes when you view like 3 people. I follow thousands and when I search individually to pages there&#39;s posts I haven&#39;t seem for months And I wonder what happened to certain users in my feed? They hide and shuffle them under a rug just so your attention is on something else that&#39;s not important in ads to sell you something so IG gets more revenue. I&#39;m sick of modern social media, and once again, please people, ditch this garbage already and let&#39;s start anew all over again. This main chain is so messed up.Awful privacy policy, there&#39;s no such thing with these apps"
music. I had a business profile and it did a music update and said i could only use songs from facebook so i switched to personal account and it still wont let me use the music i like
Hack. My page was hacked so I deleted it so I thought. It seems all my info is still out there. I guess Im a prisoner of Instagram and Facebook
"Artistic. I feel like Instagram is a playground of pictures, music, and vivid colors. It is a platform best used for expressing oneself through art, music, and video. It is an incredible platform for creativity. When you customize your feed and protect yourself from not-so-great accounts, this can act as a haven and even as an escape from reality. From accounts that take you across the globe, exhibiting breathtaking photos and videos from places around the world, to culture, cooking, poetry, positive words, good news only, music, and inspirational accounts. Enjoy the beauty that the world has to offer. If you choose to only follow positive accounts and things that feed into your life, this can be the best platform out there for you"
"Better privacy. I received about 15 tags within last 5 minutes and all are different accounts with different names, but are posting the exact same picture of a girl exposing her breast so that you can see what LINK she wants you to go to. Its very irritating that you guys cant control accounts like that. My account is private and I dont know how when my account is private INSTAGRAM still allows accounts that you have no part in or have no friends in common with TAG YOU. FIX THIS"
Notifications. The only bad thing about this app is that I turn on notifications for very important Tae Kwon Do online classes and other info and most of the time I dont get a notification on it and that is really annoying. But other then that huge problem Instagram is a great app to get in touch with people
Some features dont work. Ok so the feature to add music is not showing up anymore and when I post my videos or pictures it doesnt allow me to choose to add to my personal FB either. Its like when I made my profile pubic for work purposes it took all of that out. My colleagues profiles theyre allowed to do that but I cant which is crazy. I tried to see if it needed an update and nothing. I hate the fact that its asking me to pay for people to view on my Facebook. My Facebook is private its for my friends to see.  its annoying when before I didnt get that notification. They need to fix app and place an option for the app not to ask me to pay for something that was available before that was  for free and if I want to show some of what I do for work to be sent to Facebook automatically like before I made my IG public its ridiculous
Nothing but worthless ads. Its become practically unusable as a social media platform. Instead of seeing posts from people and accounts I follow - and actually want to hear from - I am spammed with ads and suggested posts from the apps broken algorithms. A total waste of data and time
"No privacy. I made a new Hulu account and Instagram, yet Insta is showing me ads from my Hulu? I dont remember agreeing to have my privacy exploited for ads"
"Privacy Concerns. It refuses to let me post to story without giving it Camera and Microphone access, even though it can just access the photos I selected in my camera roll, which is where I'm posting from, so I don't need to use the camera or microphone anyways"
If your account is hacked support will not help you. Ive sent like 30 video selfies of myself and emailed photo ID of me and my ig is synched with my Facebook which Facebook required me to use photo Id and they verified me however I was hacked on Instagram and they cannot even verify me my video selfie gets denied everytime. How do you not know how to ID me when I have pictures of me in my own account 
"Always Been Good, but Why Does Instagram Own my Privacy?. Instagram is a tried-and-true social media app, though its integration with Facebook definitely resulted in a loss of its uniqueness, as all of its features now mimic either Facebook, Snapchat, or TikTok. But there is one aspect of Instagram that I absolutely cannot stand, and it is that there is no possible way to truly clear your data from the Instagram app. Have you ever noticed that, even after clearing your search history, Instagram still brings up suggested users under the search bar when you start typing letters? These suggestions are based on your past history and data and are, essentially, a search history of their own. I have tried logging out of accounts, deleting the app, offloading the app on my iPhone, stopping iCloud syncing, you name it. No matter what, suggested searches still come up. That means that Instagram has cached my data somewhere that is inaccessible to me and where I have no control over their usage of it. Now, most apps and sites do this, too, but at least theyre discreet about it and ensure that it doesnt interfere with my user experience. You need to fix this, Instagram...I should have the option of clearing my user data whenever I want"
Too much cenoring Freedoms of speech is dead This app is nothing but a data collector. This app is nothing but sensor you collect your data and block you when you dont like what youre talking about
"My insta. Cant live without it Easy to use and fun to interact with like minded people The only thing I dont like is that I cannot figure out to link business Facebook accounts, can only link to personal Otherwise I post and post"
"Dangerous, insecure cesspool from a reckless incompetent company. This app is dangerous and fundamentally flawed. The apps security concepts are a joke. The Instagram staff are incompetent and some even sell accounts and user data to the highest bidder. Facebook/Instagram should really be investigated for the illegal activity they both encourage and support"
"Privacy. I wish there was more than just going private , I dont need my followers to know who Im following"
Too many privacy issues. Uninstalling because I dont trust Facebook owned products. They are spyware. Also can you please fix your mobile website? It doesnt work and it keeps trying to force me to download the app
Harassment. Absolutely upset with instagram someone had stolen a video of mine and posted it on a meme account I have no idea as to how this person got a hold of a video of me. I reported the video multiple times and then Instagram told me that this person had not violated the community guidelines. Is it not violating my privacy by posting content or me without my consent. Im absolutely gobsmacked that Instagram did not help me with this issue and I will be reporting this further
Going downhill. Instagram used to be a very fun place a while ago but now you cant even speak to your friends with foul language without getting banned from typing theyre so sensitive about everything Ive been on Instagram since 2014 but now Im really getting ready to delete the app why does Instagram monitor chats we hold with friends thats an invasion of privacy. Ill give Instagram about another year to get it together but if not Im deletekng the app for good Im so tired of this app &amp; getting my accounts deleted or getting shadow banned or them monitoring everything you do its exhausting
"If you like being limited and watched this is the app for you. Youre speech is so limited when arguing and you get reported by bots, not even real people. Used to be good,  they even started monitoring your direct messages (DM) which is so uncomfortable. I have deleted this app and I bet everyone is uncomfortable with losing their social status there that they are still going to use it. I followed a war news page, in which they posted news from all over the world involving war. They had posted a recent incident with out gore or blood in involved in the news. All that was posted was people trying to migrate but couldnt cause they werent allowed passed a border. Its odd how that was flagged and all other news involving the incident were too. At this point they got a grasp on us to stick their big f*cking nose in everything and have no privacy. If you like being limited and watched this is the app for you"
"EVERYONE GETS HACKED. Instagram is the WORST app for privacy accounts get hacked left and right. And there is NO way to contact Instagram to help you and sending a report adds no help. I am astonished that Instagram can now be use for shopping. Never EVER should someone put their card or spend money on the app. Privacy is breached and someone can steal your card information. Id give you a zero, but I cant so Ill give you a ONE"
"New updates make Instagram a place of advertising. I hate the new direction of Instagram. Its now undoubtedly just another advertisement place for selling to the masses. No longer personal, and just another place for businesses and people to sell to you. The shop tab is annoying and I want to delete it, take us back to when social media was about social interactions and not a place to collect data and personalize how business can target you to sell their product. Now when I delete a story or photo Instagram has to save them for 30 days??? Why? Another way to collect data and another added step for us to remove anything. We need a new social company that is for the people"
"Fake Profiles targeting people of color. Whats up with all of the black business accounts being hacked, censored and scammed? Everyday I see more and more fake accounts targeting black businesses and black spiritualists who speak their truth, post  history facts, have a generous amount of faithful followers and small businesses on your platform. I report at least 3 or more everyday. What is the problem? Why are they being targeted and what is Instagram doing to protect their identity and small businesses? No one should have to post this is MY ONLY ACCOUNT in their bio and profile No one should have to move their videos to Patreon because they are being censored, hacked, or scammed because of fake accounts. No one should have to rebuild a page that was taken down for posting factual information concerning health, black history and wealth. The truth is just that TRUTH And truth cannot be burned regardless of who tells it and more importantly truth cannot be white-washed as we are witnessing this in real time. Fix your platform and stop targeting black businesses who post truthful information. This country and all of its history and media is not innocent nor is it perfect"
"oops. i had originally downloaded the app to be able to communicate with my then friends, but it became its own monster of sorts. not that its all bad. its pretty much another facebook type of app. considering facebook owns them it makes sense. my complaint isnt that. but its that i had problems before mainly in trying to log into my account. but the straw that broke this camels back was, the most recent problem. similar to what i described prior but now no fixs were working. i tried to reach out to instagram but i didnt receive anything back. so, i dont recommend this app. the support or help section is nothing but a run around and no one responded back to my attempts to communicate my problems. seriously, its really a time waster and at best a poor mans facebookre: it turns out my account was supposedly hacked or something... ( the password was changed and two post went up selling sunglasses, if you know me i dont promote anything especially that type of commercialism that seriously serves no purpose.) not that instagram told me anything. as a matter of fact they faulted me and i guess that you have to blame someone but i did nothing wrong. not that instagram cares. so i take my case to the people. this is the customer service instagram and others feel is appropriate... thanks, no thanks"
"Social police?. Used to be a place to share photos. Hey what a concept Now they got involved in the 2020 election, STILL have voter information links and will censor anyone who doesnt align with their political agenda. Meanwhile the app is full of bugs. Very dissatisfied"
Algorithm. why is it that occasionally instagram thinks its cool to just ignore my personal interests and show me stuff thats popular in my country and my feed is replaced with uninteresting garbage. please remove this. im tired of itPLEASE REMOVE POPULAR IN MY COUNTRYi know you guys buy my info/interests to tailor stuff to me so why have you stopped doing that. ???
"Using users for unethical financial gain. Like all platforms and the internet overall, Instagram is 75% aggressive ads to psychologically manipulate behavior and generate higher profit off of tracking our behavior, 24% false information that has blown up bc people only see what they want to hear, and 1% actual content which is generous. Recently been bombarded with more ads than actual follower posting. This was supposed to be a creative outlet, not a breeding ground for profit at the cost of mental health. Switch to vsco or a physical photo album"
"Scary, Invasive, Not Secure. This app its very hostile to privacy and it seems to be impossible to delete your profile and information.  Its also incredibly insecure.  I  tried it to track family and was hacked quickly after starting.  This is negligent development at best.Instagram had zero support to fix the account or address the problems I had.  Now someone else happily uses my old account and there is nothing I can do about it.  My family is all leaving the app.   TL/DRYou will get hacked, there is no solution, not privacy, run away and tell everyone you know"
Why cant business accounts  access music. I dont understand why Instagram stops business accounts from accessing music the only music that business accounts can access is uncopyrighted music when other personal accounts can access all music it doesnt make any sense this needs to be changed
"Censorship and privacy. Why are you watching my internet search history and my conversations with friends so that an ad will come up for whatever Ive been talking about? Thats an invasion of privacyYou also cannot tell me what I can and cant talk about and remove my posts if it goes against your agenda. You shadowban accounts that tell the truth and make them unsearchable, I cant share certain posts or accounts with friends as it goes against your agenda. Your blatant attempt at trying to control the public through is sickening"
"Spying on us. First of all they started spying on us and getting access to our microphone, photos, and also spying on us I mean we cant even breath now, there is no privacy anymore and this has to stop"
Internet problems. I have my phone connected to the WiFi and my cellular data and Instagram keeps saying cant refresh feed and I know its not my wifi or my cellular data because Facebook and Snapchat work perfectly fine its just Instagram
"DO NOT USE - UNSAFE. My account of 10+ years was hacked 3 days ago, as well as my SMALL BUSINESSES ACCOUNT. The hacker turned on 2-factor authenticator and I am essentially locked out. Ive been emailing Instagram and Facebook , verified my identity, wrote tweets, but Facebook does not EMPLOY HUMANS, the process is completely automated, so no response. NAKED PICTURES of my TODDLER are in my inbox; pictures of him in the bathtub sent between his father and I. My father passed away last year and his instagram is private so I can no longer look at his pictures. DO NOT USE THIS APP. They do not care about your privacy or your safety. I started my account when I was 17 and I have lost EVERYTHING from it. I registered my business name with the Government of Ontario a week ago, only to have my account stolen. This is an absolute nightmare. Do not trust this app if you value your privacy, sanity or peace of mind"
Ads of Instagram. Dear Instagram please delete Ads from personal pages and makes us feel comfortable it seems that someone came to our privacy and do something and advertising on a personal page without permission from the ownerAnd I got 3 stars because of this reason
"Privacy options. Id really like to make my profile public but still have the option to make specific posts private-OR- to keep my profile private but make some posts PUBLIC. I mostly keep it private so I can maintain a semblance of safety for my son, but I still enjoy sharing other parts of my life that I dont feel as protective about. Please please please make this an option"
WOULD BE 5 STARS IF YOU REMOVE ACCESS DATA FEATURE. PLEASE REMOVE THE FEATURE INSTAGRAM PLEASE OR LET US DELETE IT ANY HACKER CAN SEE WHAT YOUVE DONE LIKE COME ON INSTAGRAM PLEASE REMOVE THE FEATURE IM BEGGING YOU
"Restrictions. We are in quarantine, so of course well be liking things more and commenting more. First off, restricting private personal accounts for liking too many posts is not appealing at all. Secondly, if someone disagrees with your comment, they can report you for it. That means youll get restricted for having an opinion. Dont get this app, Ive had it for four years and it never fails to displease me. "
"Bring back the old IG. Facebook destroys everything it touches. Too many ads. And speaking of ads, I find it odd that Im presented with things I just had a conversation about. Not searching for through IG, or even searching via Safari. A spoken conversation. Please stop. Theres so much crap pilfering my feed that I can barely stand to use the app most days. Bring back the old IG where all I saw were photos from the people I followed, and their stuff didnt disappear, either"
"Good, but ton of irrelevant content. A decent app, if you dont mind a flood of commercials and an exposure to irrelevant content. While its fun, it doesnt have a separate messaging app such as FB messenger, so in order for you to go to your private messages, you need to go through a barrier of info, which cannot be bypassed, hence the world of intoxicating news is always in your face even if you dont need or want it"
"Used to be my favorite app. First time I got an iPhone in 2012 I fell in love with Instagram. Ever since someone harassed me on Instagram though, theyve stopped treating my account as real, and I keep getting automated messages telling me my account will be disabled, and downloading my account data/pics isnt an option.  And when I unfollow people if suggests I just make a new account. Harassers win on this app. Shrug"
Please stop posting pictures of my personal billings and address. This horrible to post personal information about a person with out there consent today I found my phone bill displayed for half the world to see get real thats a violation of my privacy . At this point I dont want to share pictures if you just take personal information for everyone to see shame on you
"Direct Message masinsecurity. Hellorecently someone Strange was adding me to bad groups with fake accounts which I really hate like pornography groups and Demand for Nudity which it feels so bad every time I opened instagram because I dont like those stuffs And when someone is adding you to bad groups makes you feel InsecurityPlease let us choose who can Dm us or add us to groups on instagram I think its kind of privacy I finally deleted my account because I had no idea what to do with these groups every day.Please instagram limit and Avoid pornography groups and nudity on instagram And Please don&#39;t let sexually ill people bullying by sending follow request with nudity profile and add people to bad and pornography groups I love instagram But i love safe instagram more Special thanks Thanks  Old review bellow Stealing information is kind of bullying ,when I cant do anything about it I love instagram  so much But1- Because i was hurting from a  bad person that  He was trying to access to my account for several times And instagram couldnt stop him2_ The login activity was another city most of the time 3-the hackers tagged me on bad photos which its so hard Please Stop bullying and stealing on Instagram  It really hurts Even the hackers used my number and my email to  continue their bullying  which it was so hard to me for example sadly I couldnt receive emails from instagram but the hackers could receive them and they used them several times Another example is that the hackers used my number and they could receive sms from instagram but I couldnt Instagram lets simple and bad people hurt other people by  bullying and stealing on Instagram  Even they sent me a lot of fake emails with the name of instagram And they asked me to do odd things for changing password I received a lot of fake emails from instagram every dayI felt so bad I love instagram But  i love Safe instagram more  And now sadly I cant use it  Please make instagram a safe place for everyone"
Amazing features and entitlement to privacy love it. I recommend 
Really great. This app has always cheered me up if I felt sad. It allows me to communicate whichever way I prefer with my friends. The privacy system is the best Ive seen on any social media platform
Still spying hub. This app still listens to your mic despite not telling you. Good job Facebook done with this privacy nightmare of a platform
Instagram Review. It is amazing to have a platform that I can use for personal and professional use without having to pay a fee. This app is convenient and filing to use. I cant wait to see what it has in store for us in the future
"Its getting old. Not enough privacy, too much targeted content. Feels insidious and wrong on multiple levels. Seems like Instagram is solely for the purposes of exploiting its users"
"Insta is violating its own rules. This is regarding posts that talk about the situation in Palestine being remove or banned. Honestly I love insta, but now I am worried, because if they violate their own rules then what about the other rules? Now I am worried about my privacy and I think there is no credibility anymore. Hope this changes to the better so I can adjust my review"
"no privacy if hacked. please instagram if hackers are still hacking into peoples accounts can you please make the option to turn of dms completely, so you cant send anything or receive anything. Ive had so many problems with hackers in the last few months I honestly want to delete instagram all together if this doesnt stop"
"Terrible. This app is terrible. My account is always hacked. My account is always blocked against taking actions. I am unable to use and enjoy the app freely. I am unable to load pictures, post comments, like pictures add followers, remove followers, etc. what does Instagram do about it? Nothing"
Business & Personal. I used IG for both business and personal use. Personally to share  my stories with my friends and family around the globe and professionally to share what my business has to offer with potential customers locally
"My page was hacked. IG dose not care about the people that use their app because, my page was hacked like many other people and their help center makes it even more stressful. Theyre not helpful for starters, they give you a whole bunch of info that takes you in circles and changes nothing. There are no links or chat boxes to get you personalized help. When you report an account it doesnt even seem as if they really investigate. There is so many people out there assuming peoples identity on IG and they do nothing. They will make sure your posting correct info about Covid but careless if you get hacked and or if your page gets taken over and the person is harassing your friends posing as you"
Love Instagram. Love to use it for my business and for personal enjoyment
"HACKED ACCOUNTS. If your account is hacked, or if you need any kind of help, Instagram will not help you. They have made it impossible to regain access to hacked accounts and do not care.Their bots that check on reported accounts serve as useless"
"Instagram. This app has great privacy settings to keep creeps aka weirdos away, and overall is a great social media app"
"Completely corrupted by Facebook. Invasive ads ever 2-3 posts, completely random and unappealing sponsored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow, mixing shopping posts with regular posts (as if anyone wants to buy something from some meme account on Instagram), and the fact that I cannot remember the last time that they kept the App format the same for more than a month. They keep moving things around to squeeze in the new junk that nobody wanted and put them in place of things like your profile or your activity in order to trick users into interacting with their failed experiments mentioned above.I spend more time flagging suggested posts that I dont want to see than I spend actually engaging with any content. This company does not care about its consumers at all and will happily sell your data, your attention, and your dearest interests to the highest bidder until you have nothing but bitterness left for them"
"Covered in follow suggestions and call feature?. Thats all I see on every page Instagram has ,who I should follow that I dont want to follow ,covering my gallery as well now too which is truly awful ,what is this new call feature and how do we turn it off? Please give us privacy settings for that"
"Bullying. Reports dont work if someone starts bullying you, people have exposed my private info and instagram hasnt taken action to remove those accounts"
"What happened??. Over the past few years, I feel like Instagram has become the worst app for peoples mental health. Im sure many can agree with me on this. Instagram definitely knows, but does the minimum to help/change things. Im sure some businesses thrive through this platform, but I think it is terrible for personal use"
"The messaging section = SPYING. Anything you send in there privately  turns into ads, and its run by a soulless group of humanoids"
"No support center. Instagram has a help center that is just an online forum. When you need actual help you cant get it. You might try everything the help center suggests but if nothing works, good luck because theres no other solution. Oh and hopefully your privacy and personal information doesnt get leaked in the process"
Privacy is a thing of the past. They made it mandatory to enter your date of birth not to verify that youre over the age of 18 or whatever but to actually enter your birthday when entering a falls birthday they deleted my account afterAfter attempting to submit a review I noticed that they want a picture of my identification is privacy is not a thing anymore guess I dont have an Instagram account
Hacked. Ive been hacked on my instagram account and my personal data is being spread. The company have done nothing to help me and now my data is exposed
"Bringing you closer to adverts. My feed now has 1 in 4 posts as an advertisement. Coupled with people hawking stuff as influencers theres very little bringing me closer to friends and people I love. Its mostly trash, misinformation and people giving unsolicited advice or opinions in the comments section. Like Facebook, going to uninstall - before Facebook merges DMs with messenger to monopolise my data"
More privacy. Is there anyway to add more privacy in the personal profile. For example certain ppl to only see certain pictures on your profile ?
"Demands Camera and Microphone Access. This app is absolute trash, the post story function isn&#39;t able to put multiple images onto one post (in stories, not posts). The constant reworking of the UI has been bothering me a lot and I&#39;d rather have a consistent app that is easy to use yet has the basic functionality that it should have. Posting images and videos also adds the &#34;Instagram version&#34; into my camera roll, which I do not want. It also doesn&#39;t work well with my iPhone 11&#39;s aspect ratio and posting images will always have sides cropped out, either making them look ugly or incomplete. It also demands camera and microphone access, which I have consistently denied so far. When enabled, you can&#39;t set the camera and microphone access to be disabled by default when entering a video chat, so they basically took away my access to some important privacy options. Instagram is also hella broken on Windows 10. The website is like half-working and the app on the Microsoft Store has the same issues. And the app on the Microsoft Store doesn&#39;t let you join video chats which is very inconvenient for people like me who spend most of the time working on a PC without a phone nearby"
"Not the app it used to be. Full of Advertisements(For me every 3 posts is an advertisement in stories too) , Tik Tok Videos (called Reels) and no more chronological order. Instagram has been on a slow decline since it got bought by Facebook but its gotten so much worse. I had an account since 2012 permanently deleted it and saved my account. Its legit just data mining for advertisers now"
"BAD UPDATES MAKING IT WORST. From moving the likes/comments section to a far up small corner in the top of the screen, to put the dumb and useless shopping section.... is a INSTAGRAM originally made for instant moments pictures eventually videos... BUT SHOPPING this is not freaking amazon... and not just that.... on private conversations when you erased them they come back up, sometimes it just accumulated lots of PM that are taking space and when sending a video/photo they removed the option to check details such as seen/open  WORST UPDATES... the only thing that probably keeps me there is all the photos/videos history I have since Instagram app open"
"Major Censorship and Privacy Issues.. Annoying Spam. Its technically functionalTons of spam accounts and comments to monitorMajor censorship targeting indigenous businesses.Often reports of deleted posts and stories due to Instagram censorship (often innocuous, like awareness parades, or artwork )When it comes to any kind of censorship they favor white centric posts.Unhealthy, theres better social media out there. Too many Ads"
"Telling everyone their personal information. Ive had Instagram for a long time with no problems and now it is just telling me for my number, asking for my email a lot of times and asks to see my contacts. There is no need for that and that is why Im giving it a 1 star. Here is an edit I wanted to make a new account and it wont let me"
"Spam. I get a lot of spam or fake accounts, sending requests. I report them but Instagram says hey dont violate the community rules. Not good business because there are a lot of gullible people who would fall for these scams"
Hate need. I honestly hate Instagram these days. I miss the timeline being in order by when you posted. I see posts that are literally 3-5 weeks old from popular accounts but my feed will say all caught up when I know the people I follow are posting and Instagram has just decided not to show me. Also that the whole you earn your followers with each post crap if I pressed follow I want to see their stuff I dont want your algorithm to decided for me that because it didnt get enough likes in 5 minutes I dont want to see it. It doesnt even make sense considering its a global app. Also once you like something you shouldnt see it again show me new things instead of the stuff I already liked last week. But its better than Facebook and has less data breach than tiktok so I guess we all just settle for this
Hacking. I have to place my account on private to avoid hacking by instagram. Its supremely annoying
Illegal. I hate the app simply because you guys track what I do and look at on my phone so I have an enjoyable explorer page and Im actually pretty sure thats illegal I had to hard reset my phone because my ex kept lurking and Id get the same adds and memes she does I dont look at Facebook memes or care for astrology or even care for whats on other peoples stuff I want a personal account with personal things that isnt decided by what I do on my phone oh well we cant do that well you better figure it out before other people realize the same thing and everyone quits using your app
Lets Hackers take your account. They dont care about your security and refuse to help when Ive lodged over 15 forms saying my account is hacked for over 2 weeks They let a Russian hacker take my account and change all my details and there is no way to get it back Terrible customer service and dont trust them dont be on Instagram YOU ARE NOT SAFE and they WONT HELP YOU They just ignore you after the 10th time.. instead of making me prove who I am make the hacker prove its them in the pictures
"DISABLED ACCOUNT. How is it possible that Instagram collects our data for free for years, but decides to deactivate accounts because of their bad AI and algorithms? The appeal system is broken, fix it"
Track track track. Finally. Instagram has to make a ton of dollars to pay off investors (like zucksteronius needs them) with our private activities. Zuckdik has more of us than is moral. Enough. Thank you apple
Great app. Easy to use dont like Instagram changing the format like putting people i dont know info to be friends with   Theyre a reason why my account is private
Instagram. Please get rid of the automatic crop I do photography and this ruins my pictures when posting on your app. Also it would be great if I could allow my personal account to be private while having my business account be public. I dont like that my personal account has to be public and then I get a bunch of random people following me  on my personal account and I dont know them. Thats a huge issue. Change your app
"What an eefing joke of a privacy policy. Their ad settings allow you to adjust how they advertise to you. They offer an option for you to turn off the curation of ads based on your consumer searches and history on several platforms. I have these turned off so that I get ads that dont pertain to m. SOMEHOW they still advertise these things to me AN HOUR after I just talk about it anywhere near my phone. Theyre CONSTANTLY listening to my conversations, CONSTANTLY monitoring my searches on separate platforms, and CONSTANTLY violating my privacy. What a joke of a corporation"
Yes. I value this form of social media. I left fb due to privacy issues. Instagram has the option of having a private account and I value this option so much.I love the visual of seeing photos and the live option has been a gift to enjoy the artists I normally couldnt afford to see perform etc Thought Id have to leave Instagram for the reason I left fb but that is turning out to not be the case. I feel safe and able to share as I wish here shinokawewa
Privacy breaches. Social engineering  Unprecedented violations of privacy.No reluctance to do anything
"Bettering Instagrams security and privacy. Dear Instagram, I do sincerely apologize for having to write a review but somebodys obviously got to do it right. Okay soo first thing is you can start but gathering and collecting all the foreign bot accounts that made by some of them and the accounts that are ran by scammer too as well off there because they are very very annoying and someone on here always trying to get my information. So be so kindly and do your job thanks. Ps I wouldnt ask for a rate again cuz youll prolly wont get one. -Greydays"
Turning away from its original purpose. Instagram makes it harder to see posts you like and harder to post pictures. The new layout is focused on buying/selling which Ive never used Instagram for. As well as videos from people I dont even follow nor am I interested in. I also receive notifications about people I dont follow (despite having turned off the notification setting)
Things get worse over time. IG is a fun for me and my only social media outlet. I learn about the world around me through using this app and also enjoy sharing on it. The constant bombardment of advertisements and policy updates have made it less enjoyable for me. I feel like my privacy is breached. But still continue to use it for now
"Functional. The app itself works just fine, unfortunately the content is frustrating and/or unable to filter posts. Everyone is selling something. Beyond the paid advertising. It would be nice just to share pictures and experiences. Its wonderful that people have an outlet but at some point Instagram just morphs into a full blown marketplace. I wish I could just filter out posts selling something unless Im looking to buy something"
"Great for small businesses. I love using instagram to grow my business and build my relationships with my current clients and future clients.Its easy and fun to use with so many ways to connect. They have the feed, stories, DMs &amp; comments, and IGTV. Out of all the social media platforms this has it all I love using it for personal use too, Searching and shopping Thank you the gramWendy E De La Rosa"
"New people I dont follow in my news feed?. There is a new update that allows you to see accounts that you dont follow at the end of your news feed. I do not like this. I only want to see people that already follow in my newsfeed. If I want to follow new people I will look for them myself using hashtags.Instagram has been a much friendlier community than Facebook or Twitter, which is one of the main reasons why I use this app. Theres not as much fighting over politics etc, but this recent update allows more political fighting to show up in my feed. I think they are doing it on purpose to stir people up and get them to come back and fight more on this otherwise friendly platform, then they can sell more ads to returning users. I dont want instagram turning into another dumpster like Facebook and Twitter. I had two accounts one public, one private. I have deleted one account, and deleted the app from my phone, so I am not currently using the other account because of this very issue"
Notifications. I hate that this app can detect your mobile contacts and invite you to follow that person on Instagram. It gives you the exact contact person name and direct them to their IG handle. It feels like an invasion of privacy and spying. Please tell me how do I deactivate this feature on my phone
"Rated R. Love Instagram but I wish there was a way to control privacy settings for individual posts. Like some things I just dont want my mom or aunt to see, ya know?"
"Instagram is killing their own platform. Instagram use to be fun and enjoyable platform. Then they changed their algorithm killing any engagement or likes you use to get. Now Instagram feed is awful. Every 4th post is someone you actually know, in between that you have sponsored posts, ads and hashtag posts. Its clear consumers are the product and just a cash cow to Instagram to show adverts. If you love an online billboard this is the app for you. Instagram or meta sort it out Your killing the app for users just like with Facebookgreat to see such transparency on data collected absolutely everything about you is harvested and sold on"
Could be improved. So I have been using Instagram for a long time. I think since 2011. I have seen it grow. They have introduced Instagram message for a quite sometime. They could introduce the same features that whats app did. I dont want to see messages preview but I want to see who sent it so I can choose to reply accordingly when my phone is unlocked so there should be an option to choose it. Or if I dont want to see the details of the comments but I want to see who commented. It is not so hard to add these features. It helps users protect their privacy. **addedI hope these changes get added.Another advice is that we should be able to download videos like TikTok This will give Instagram a great advantage
"Instagram is a problem. Instagram is either censoring marginalized people by shadow banning content, stealing ideas from other developers or allowing a lot of scammers to thrive on the app...this app has totally changed for the worse. Its also become very invasive by trying to merge your Facebook with your instagram and not ensuring privacy. You manipulate your user base so they are constantly chasing likes or purchasing things they dont need. They actively censor Black Lives Matter, Free Palestine and a number of other social movements but allow hate speech and bullying to thrive on the very same platform to the point that soccer players have to boycott you and this toxic platform youve created. Instead of evening the playing field youve just been silencing voices you dont like. Its no longer about sharing creative photos, snap shots, freedom of expression and everything about greed, power and suppression. No thanks"
Instagram doesnt protect our accounts. My account has been hacked I do all my business on this account. Although I am getting codes to both email and phone it is still not enough to get my account back Many people are reporting it and still Instagram not giving it back I did the video with face recognition like 20 times and still insta cant verify its my true self although I have a lot of pictures on Instagram At least we need protection against hacking
Straight up a sales marketing app. Continues to move towards a disingenuous sales and marketing app. Look where the placed that nee shopping button and how they show the feed. Posts not being chronological and based on whatever algorithm that allows them to target posts on influencing the user to consume what they want you to see. Count the amount of targeted ads and posts to interests with some sort of consumer/sales objective. Also the fact they are tracking user data not just across the app but your entire internet usage is quite alarming and worrisome
No support. My account was hacked and Instagram has done nothing to help. I had to create a whole new account because they dont seem to care about peoples privacy being invaded. Help people get their accounts back and keep them
"Data tracking. Every 4th post is an advertisement for something googled or searched on another application. Despite the complete ridiculousness of so many ads, this company blatantly proves they are tracking your every move on your device. Went from such an amazing creation to not even close to competing to TikTok and a number of other social media platforms"
Disappointed. Every time I open Instagram it says it has connection issues. Yet my wifi and celular data is working fine for all my other apps and devices. Whats going on? Music being taken away? Demographics changed. Now youre trying to sell us more things than making about pictures
"Instagram is the worst thing sense Facebook. Instagram is great if you love fake meme pages that only plug crappy products, false advertisements for mobile games that are nothing like they show, millions upon millions of bot accounts that comment on everything plugging their fake pages that spreading misinformation and again crap products, and excessive data farming. Instagram is without a doubt the worst social media platform. Apart from Facebook obviously. It is an incoherent mess of product placement and bot accounts. Dont believe me? Go to any page with 100,000+ followers and look at the comments on their posts. Instagram is a cyber train wreck whose soul purpose is data farming and advertisement like its parent platform Facebook. It is not social media. It is a corporation designed to market products better. They could easily clean up their bot problem but having millions of fake accounts on hand allows pages to have insanely inflated followings so you and your kids see them more and consume advertising more. If your reading this I want you to look at the comments on big pages posts, and while your at it look at the posts themselves. Instagram is crap and is a symptom of our standards, expectations for services, and awareness declining greatly. Thanks for your time"
"Trash app that limits features for users it deems not worthy. Instagram picks and chooses what accounts it deems worthy to have key features which in my opinion is awful. I have been trying to share posts on my story for LITERALLY MONTHS in my personal account and my Instagram does not have the feature. However, the other account I share with people for our joint account has full access to share public posts on that story. I would love to know how Instagram picks and chooses who they allow full access of the app to and who they decide is not relevant enough to have the same simple features. Anyone from Instagram able to give an answer?"
Privacy. It would be great if we can pin favorite posts and choose whether a post can be public or private
They steal information. They save your phone numberWont allow me to make more than one account
"Well. Another app turned evil. Well. Not Instagram is owned by Facebook, and the robot known as zuckerberg is stealing information and listening to your conversations. Dont give him access to your phone. Delete this scam of an app. Mess this man up by deleting the app and getti g rid of his income"
"Your life will be much better without it. - i was kind of person who checked instagram every 30 min, i lost my access to it ( mentioned below how) and my life is much better now, i can finally focus while studying or working, have much more time to enjoy real life and spend time with real human instead of some pictures which covered with filters and fake happiness.I really feel bad for people who addicted to it .when i go to restaurants or mall , people just keep scrolling their phone instead of socializing or enjoying their time outside once saw 4 people at a table, instead of taking to each other and enjoy their time they keep scrolling their phone, they talk and look at each other once.. and it was for selfie..Just delete the app for 1 day and see how you feel, you will never download it again So I activate my 2 step authentication on app ( since app mentioned to do it for better security ), long story short I lost my phone, and even I remember my password and username and i have access to my email, i cant login. Went to help center, fill up all the information requested ( they even emailed me to write some numbers and take selfie ) but after almost 2 months nobody responds. Send the millions of other emails, not even single responds. At this point I only want them to delete my personal information"
home page+privacy=deleting. instagram worked fine before but at this point im just gonna delete it. first off the terms and conditions and the fact that instagram can watch you through ur camera and sell ur info is just ridiculous. also my home page which is supposed to feature only people i follow/know is full of accounts i dont follow. if i wanted to see that i could just go to the explore page. like my home page is just spammed with ads and other accounts where i just end up closing the app. im deleting it
Why remove features ?. Why has Instagram decided to remove the media in the chat info so now my friends and I cant access memories and why remove the sharing of profiles ??? Ive noticed some similar things have happened in messenger??
"Instagram is spying on you. Even if your privacy settings are in place, your conversations are monitored. Never told anyone or searched online for a certain insect repellent, yet ads for it are showing up in your feed? You are not alone"
"No privacy. Privacy is eliminated when a liked post, a mutual friend/follower appears to everyone I know Not cool at all"
New privacy laws. The new update is ridiculous Simply means no more privacy for us users &amp; ig can now monitor us 24/7 via our cameras &amp; speaker
Locked out. Instagram now requires you to take a video selfie to access your own account. This wont use face recognition or collect biometric data sure...... never using this app again
App is terrible. Instagram locks you out even when you dont follow or unfollow lots of people. They lock you out even if you verify your account with a pin sent to your phone. They have no help desk so you dont even know what happens to your personal data if you are locked out and cant get back in your account after verifying your identity
Just a Data Farm. Dont download. Sole purpose is to harvest data from your device and sell your data to entities thats sole purpose is to herd and manipulate you
Stop spying on people. What happened to privacy? And freedom of speech?
Too much input. Instagram used to be really nice-a personal tool to communicate/share with those I wanted to.  Now it constantly pushes content and ads to me and really its not private anymore.  I also dislike that there is nothing to prevent minors (or anyone)from seeing all public content if they dont want that available
"Literally banning users. In the past 3 weeks, ive been banned twice from instagram for using third party websites and self promoting. if anyone checked my profile, theyd see that im a private personal account with 50 ish followers. they also take down posts the dont support sexual assault, changed the timeline feature so you basically never see your friends posts, and are letting racist homophobic and misogynistic posts become more popular. this app is not necessary, and i really hate it. its all ads, no fun. be careful not to like more than 60 posts an hour, cause then youre self promoting. make sure not to report homophobic misogynistic racist posts cause they wont take them down. basically, instagram doesnt want you to use instagram. and they only want your money"
"Privacy violation notice. Ive long noticed how Instagram view certain things in my feedback which was ok at the time, but recently Ive started to notice that Instagram do also look into the messages that I send and that is a creepy side, as to I have a certain convo w a partner or a friend, it is not ok for Instagram to be a third whee in the conversation.This is a big threat to our data and privacy and literally something have to be done about it"
. My favorite social media app for personal use
"They dont care about there users. I definitely would normally give a 5 start to this app, I have been using the app for a little over 5 years and have loved it. I have grown up with the account I had and had lots of personal stuff that ment a lot to me as well as having well over 1000 followers. My account got hacked with nothing I could do to prevent, and everything was changed so I had absolutely no way to get it back my self. Sent plenty of reports into instagram with my face and pictures/videos of my truck which my account was based off of and they did nothing. My old account has been messaging friends and family of mine pretending to be me and scamming them with fake investment strategies. The worst part is how instagram is doing literally nothing. There is no way to contact them directly, only a stupid help page with no helpful stuff on it. Im not mad at this app Im just sad that I had to helplessly give up something that ment a lot to me so easily with no support"
I enjoy using Instagram. I love to use Instagram to communicate with my friends and family. It is very useful for my personal use to find businesses and places where I would like to go. 
"Account severely restricted for over 3 months with no apparent reason. Most of my actions have been restricted for over 3 months. Im unable to like, comment, caption my posts, follow/follow back and edit my bio, which is now left unfinished, on an artist&#39;s profile 3 months is a ridiculously long time. There is no history of violation or any warning ever. I have been reporting the problem through the &#34;tell us&#34; button each time I attempted an action. I have also sent numerous reports through the &#34;Help - Something isn&#39;t working&#34; buttons. I never received any feedback whatsoever and nothing has ever changed.I have tried everything else I saw recommended. I have obviously waited and took very long breaks without trying any action. I have updated my app, updated my software, logged out an back in, unlinked my facebook page and re-linked it, removed my other 2 accounts from the app, switched to mobile data only and even tried from various different networks since I&#39;ve also been abroad during this time.Instagram is a communication and business tool and in these extraordinary times more essential than ever. It&#39;s hard to believe you are letting down your users when the platform is most needed. Let alone users who have spent money on promotions. The help Center should definitely be more personal and actually offer some help"
"Will give 5 if. 1) you had a separate app called Direct. It is annoying because once you open Instagram you get distracted to a lot of things, but if it was a separate app it would be great. I am afraid to open Instragram because I know I gonna sink. If I only need to reply to a message.2) if there was an option to stop videos from auto uploading .it would save a lot of data to me"
Privacy. It would be awesome if there was a way that you could lock your followers and who you follow without exactly having to lock or make your profile private
"instagram. Hey somehow the app Instagram isnt letting me log into my account and when I keep on trying to put my information it says  sorry, there was a problem with your request  I need help with that"
"0/10. New terms of service do not allow for privacy of any kind. Access to camera and can record at any time, GPS location, full text/call history, entitled to all computer info, banking info and nearby devices on the same network. No warning or update notification, you simply agree by using the app. Deleting"
"One-sided((. I hate Instagram policy that unfair and wrong. Its deleting or hiding by sensitive for others whenever people post about Palestine(( Its just not giving opportunity to share with information. Its stealing our right  Its better to share fascism and Zionism, but not a suffering Palestinian"
"Use less data please.

"Very nice and easy set up. Instagram has a very easy set up for posting, videoing, messaging, settings, privacy, etc. If you want a peaceful and easy going social media app, Instagram is definitely the way to go"
"Privacy invasion. This app is just the worst it invades my private messages and delete photos and videos I have sent in private message to someone just because they the creator did not like the content, but who gave it the right to view my private messages?? (the content was about Palestine if you want to find out yourselves)"
Dont agree with new terms and conditions. I DONT NEED THIS APP ON MY PHONE TRACKING EVERY MOVE I MAKE
"Fact checking private messages. Unless things change FAST on this app, Im out. How dare you fact check my messages. Then say people who share false information wont show up as much. I can tell my FRIENDS in PRIVATE MESSAGES whatever I want. You people have gone crazy with power and it will be your downfall"
"Crap app. Stupid algorithms and dumb rules remove content for horrible reasons and let other real bad stuff stay up because of how people present information. Instagram and its makers are stupid robot millionaires that only care about manipulating info and content, big tech morons"
"Patriot act. This app wont let me disable my account because it says only once per week. I disabled my account two weeks ago, logged on today to get a phone number and tried to disable again. Instagram is not allowing me to disable my account which I have disabled due to privacy concerns"
Add yours sticker. Im in New Jersey all my friends who lives in the area can use the add yours feature. I dont have it ask sticker option and if my friends post on there stories I cant click on it to add my own. Its really annoying. Ive deleted Instagram and reinstalled. Deleted data and it still doesnt show up. I even made a secondary account and it still doesnt work
"They will steal your money. They will take ads from companies designed only to get your credit card information, and then post those ads all over Instagram. This company has no shame, and will let your information be stolen for a quick buck"
Tab. I dont like that new tab that youve got where save find friends and insights are this app is getting too hard to use on here might have to uninstall soon still cant see who viewed my story after 24 hrs also should be more privacy options like you should be able to choose who sees your posts. Why is my personal account glitch its saying Ive got new likes and followers when I havent its from my other account Instagram is really going downhill get the old owner back. Igtv icon has disappeared from my main account on home :( also cant post music to my stories anymore
Keeps my data but blocks me. Take my money for a promotion but people are unable to reply to my comments or use my handle in a post - no humans available or explanation given
"DO NOT INSTALL. I wouldve went with no stars but was unable to. Instagram is an awful app. The censorship is a joke, they control everything you post using algorithms to track certain words.  If its not what they WANT you to see (propaganda), or  if your post goes against their agenda they will remove the post and possibly delete your account PS- theyre also tracking you. Hence they recently got sued for spying on people through their cameras whilst using the app and even when not using the app. DO NOT INSTALL. Keep your privacy"
New updates have ruined the app. Its boring and theres no privacy. If you have Facebook you dont need this. The new updates where they took away the friend page info have made this app boring and replaceable
"Bad. Honestly, Instagram has gone downhill. They invade too much privacy and allow illegal activity to be promoted as long as they agree with it"
"Best Social Media App EVER. Instagram is the best social media ever for my opinion . But the worst part is people hacking into your accounts . Like say you followed this person and they got hacked , their account is going to give you a link that says its from Instagram which clearly is not . It will want you to put in your password and username so you can see whatever that link is and when you do , it will say something like the post is gone . But at the meantime , Instagram is incredible . Ive been using it for years and I still havent gotten old of it  Its like a game . You get addicted to it and just keep playing it . But Instagram , you guys really need to deal with those hackers . Mostly half of my friends got hacked and have to make another account . But at the meantime , Instagram is amazing"
"Wait, you actually want to use an email?. This app is a real pain in my, well, you know.I made a new account, used my email, all that jazz. But oh How dare I use an email rather than a phone number These, um, bags, decided to lock me out of my account as the final step to sign up and then demand my phone number. Oh, poor Insta, it knows it cant harvest my data with just an email, so its supervillainous plan was to dangle my account over my head and demand my phone number to get it back Not only does that sound invasive of privacy, but they gave me a choice and I made one. Oh, and no, you cant lurk on the site. It forces you into this phone number trap.TL;DR: Instagram didnt know people like their privacy, and retaliates, like a spoiled toddler"
"Its amazing. It is an easy to use app that allows users to share photos and videos of their products and lives. It is also a good way to track your favorite celebrities and friends.you can keep up with the latest news and still see cool stories and content. You can meet new people and even possibly  celebrities like Our favorite TikTok era.all over, it is an amazing social media platform, and I totally recommend it "
"just terrible. the new update is awful. i never see my friends photos on my feed, just advertisements and suggested content that doesnt apply to me. ive stopped using instagram for about a year and im very glad i did i was just informed about their terms and conditions that are extremely privacy invading.... like how they track our eye movement in order to push advertisements. what happened to the old instagram that was so casual / fun and they weren\'t money grabbing wherever they could? its become something very ugly which i will not take part of. im seriously considering deleting my profile"
"Easily Hacked, Profile Stolen, not against community standards. My profile photo was stolen, my slightly modified name used, my Friends were spammed, and Instagram informed me that no community standards were breached. There is no easy, intuitive way to report these problems. You must choose from a list of choices that often may not apply. Terrible Security and Support"
Violation of Freedom of Speech . Instagram is being like Communist Germany  & Not Allowing Freedom of Speech  Constantly Delete my post that are facts truth information  This is awful  The only way to stop is my page private Shame on you Instagram 
Another ruined app by suckerberg. Facebook should have never been allowed to buy Instagram and ruin a great app. Suckerberg will learn the hard way. The end of these social media platforms is coming very soon. Cant wait for apple to release the new privacy update
"privacy problems. when i unrestricted someone every time i go to send them a post i have to search up theyre name because it wont go back to the top of the list even after talking for a while, also a good add is when you comment if you long hold your own comment you can copy"
censoring freedom. instagram is censoring contents of freedom seeking movements & siding the oppressor for more money. censorship is a war on our privacy & constitutions. palestine will be free
"Biased. It was good, but recently with the censoring nah. Myself as a user should be able to post whatever I want without getting views reduction from Instagram Especially that its only because my content doesnt suit a certain party. This is Instagram invading my privacy and right of using the app"
"Everyone loves it but. Everyone loves the gram but it would be nice if these features were available...Being able to edit or modify photos after youve posted them.  The option is there to delete or archive but not to edit or modify.  Maybe Im just slow but I dont understand how to share videos.  If I share them to my story they go away in a day.  And if the persons feed that you are sharing a video from is private than when you share it, it follow their privacy settings so no one can see it.  What are the other options? Or how can this be approved.  And last but not least, the help center could use some more updates to the standard help thats offered.  The selection is pretty limited and it doesnt really answer much.  Other than that I think Instagram is dope and I enjoy using the app"
Overrated. Well insta is good but not that great. First of all its very unsafe and privacy controls arent good enough. It has nowhere near enough updates and bug fixes as Facebook and still needs lots of improvements. On the bright side the app logo is nice and hashtags r brill
Instagram music is not available in your region. How do you know my region if tracking and location have been off since I downloaded the app?How do you have access to information Ive turned off permissions for?
"Extremely user unfriendly. I am a small Instagram artist who has been using this platform since 2016. Ive noticed that my art has went from getting around 20 to 30 likes to around 10 maybe 15 likes at the most. And I think I have a very good reason for it. The algorithm and interface on this platform is an absolute joke. The shopping and reels tab have replaced the posts and notifications tab, moving them to the top right of the page. Last time I checked Instagram wasnt a shopping site or a tiktok knock off My feed is littered with suggested posts and ads. I see content from people I follow for a few posts before they suggest me posts; which is fine because Im an artist but there is no way to turn it off or switch it to older posts by default. Thats what the explore feed is for. Which doesnt seem to work when I refresh it. And dont even get me started about the report system. It takes forever to report something illegal or truly harmful but if its over a stupid opinion or using an action too much youre caught. Get your priorities straight Overall if you want to use this app to get popular, I would not recommend it. They promote influencers and big name companies while leaving artists struggling to survive. Update: So now there are rumors of Insta being turned into a video sharing platform to compete with TikTok... Just... why? So the account I had for five years was all a waste? Im thinking of starting over and moving to Twitter or Tumblr if this is true. Instagram is not failing because its not TikTok. Its failing because its doing unnecessary updates and not listening to its consumers. I would give this zero stars if there were an option.Update 8/20/21: The algorithm is still crap. Im getting a ton of bots on my comments and the things Im looking for dont show up on my feed. And every second time I refresh my feed, it goes back to the default feed. Please stop all this"
"Privacy is dead. I took this app off my phone months ago because it was too much of a distraction during the week. I kept it on my iPad, which is shut down and put away during the week and only occasionally comes out on weekends.The ads in my feed on my iPad were random and while not always relevant to anything, were not at all creepy.Zuck & his company swears up & down theyre not listening to our phones. Maybe humans arent, but the AI certainly is.I put the app back on my phone this weekend and within hours up popped an ad for a product I have never looked into, am not at all interested inbut was advertised on TV while my husband & I watched a football game.  Coincidence? I think not"
"Horrible customer service. Let me start with the fact that I use this platform for multiple businesses. First, instagram allowed my personal accounts to be bullied by someone targeting me twice getting two of my accounts deleted included my only documentation of my pregnancy. Then they started to flag my instagram business accounts because I logged into multiple devices, I am a social media manager and it's MY JOB and now they are preventing me from doing MY JOB. When I report these issues nothing is done . No response. No help. Just a weird message from Facebook saying to send them a picture of me holding a paper which I've done and still have gotten zero help with anything. This platform is going down hill and I see why Tik tok is taking over. It's way easier to use and doesn't constantly restrict. I'd suggest going for Tik tok or twitter for your online marketing at this point"
Terrible system with even worse practices. Instagram is a company that gives you an increasing complicated layout and provides you with no new features. The worst part is the horrible privacy practices with Facebook and Instagram (same company) being the most intrusive. I would recommend anyone who has this app to get rid of it right away
Photo access. You dont need access to all my photos and my microphone to post an image. Providing access to only photos I select on my iPhone was an excellent privacy feature apple added and now youre blocking it. Stop being creepy AF with our personal information
"Privacy issues. I noticed that there are target adds appear to me at google and Instagram based on my Instagram viewing, this is alarming and not right"
"Its bad. Just dont get it. I want to delete my account- but the thing is- it doesnt want me to, so it can keep all my data and store all of the random facts about me in the cloud without my permission. They want to steal you from yourself. They dont care about you. They only care about their money and thats it.Im fed up of this disgusting industry- id even go as far as building my own boring social media to take instagrams and facebooks place and then just delete the whole thing. They must be the most boring people"
Followers. You can see who follows you but never informs who UNFOLLOWS you. I use a lot of apps to track. But it is never accurate so I wish Instagram and a option button that let us informs who unfollowed us. But for the people who do not need it insta can make it so we have an option to turn it on and off PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING THIS FEATURE
"No Customer Service Department. With the growing fleet of Facebook subsidiaries, it would compel the big company to expand on the customer care department that they are lacking in severely. Ive submitted at least three tickets on Instagram/Facebook, in regards to an issue on my business account, from February 2021 to May 2021. It is now June 10th and there is no response to the issues. For some odd reason, despite my app being updated to the latest version, I no longer see the option to post a reel on my business and personal accounts. This is very frustrating and also affects my business. This is a horrible business due to the fact it is a multi-billion dollar company with 0 customer service presence. FAQs are not enough"
"Full of spam and hackers. Hackers have infiltrated the app, they take over users accounts and post spam. Theres no way to get instagram to contact you or for you to contact Instagram to try and resolve the problem. I was recently hacked, Ive sent what feels like 100 emails and I havent once received an email back. Ive lost over 10 years of pictures and friends that I probably wont get back. The app is not safe anymore for kids or adults"
"Instagram just works. Look at the title . For business or personal, Instagram just makes sense and keeps connections"
No help. I hope the headline gets a developers attention because I have been trying to be in contact several times about my account I cannot get into it because I cannot get a authentication app code I was hacked and had to get a new phone and I cannot get into my account and I have sent to the proper documentation and still have not heard back.Ive been on Instagram for years and have a platform and Im just not happy that I dont feel as Im being taken care of in the right manner or time frame regardless of todays situation because this my situation has been going on prior to this
Okay. Too much censorship and violations of privacy
"Finally deleting Instagram. Cant wait til its the next MySpace. Disgusting platform that enables all types of things like fat phobia, transphobia, bullying of disabled bodies, censorship of humans, but simultaneously allows anorexics to post pictures naked but say Lizzie posts the same thing and its removed for nudity. Theyve begun overly censoring comments you cant call somebody ignorant anymore you have absolutely zero freedom of speech and now that covid is happening they are just deleting posts/comments without having people check them but it goes the other way as well things that SHOULDNT be on Instagram are allowed to stay posted for days but god forbid you share a post about personal struggle. Twitter is a fabulous alternative theyve begun adjusting their layout and its much easier to use. Instagrams made it clear they dont care about the people using their platform they just care about the money it can provide them"
Privacy. Why do I need to give access to my camera and microphone to post content from my camera roll?
Random Post Notifications. Stop sending me post notifications for profiles I don't have that feature turned on for. What's the point of having it if y'all are gonna force feed me info about who posted what???
"Becoming Facebook 2.0. My friend was Facebook jailed for sending a joke photo that if you zoomed in super far into the photo it was a pixelated P.P. No details. Just pixels in private message.... theres NO privacy and people get their posts taken down for such insignificant things. Yet, Ive seen worse things continue to exist no matter how many times you report them. Social media is going down hill fast"
"Money grabbers. Sadly Instagram is going down the dark road of maximizing their revenue. At the cost of our experience, they now shove their shop tab into our feed which is honestly useless no ones going to shop off Instagram... the ads are more frequent than ever and they lure you into the endless scrolling of recommendations which is a sly way of saying theyre stealing your data in order to try and sell you things.. I honestly have to delete the app when Im not using it to prevent them from trying to shove product placement down my throat. Shamefull"
"Tagged Photo & Follow Privacy. Im getting so many spam accounts tagging me in photos. My account is private, so why are people that I dont follow/I havent allowed to follow me/have no followers in common able to tag me in photos?Please allow privacy settings to keep random people from tagging me in photos. Its annoying and makes me fear for my privacy to have to constantly remove tags and report these accounts"
"WAY too many ads now and CREEPY tracking. They have been increasing the number of ads over the years to the point that now every 4th post is an ad. Plus they track everything you do online outside of Facebook &amp; Instagram so you get a lot of creepily personal ads. (I&#39;m not paranoid, it&#39;s true, look it up.) Any personal issue you&#39;ve looked up on the web, I can guarantee you it&#39;s in your ad profile at Facebook headquarters. Instagram used to be fun, pleasant way to kill time before Facebook got its hands on it. Their greed and penchant for spying has ruined it. Deleted the app. I&#39;m done"
Complete Invasion of Privacy. The app listens to your conversations through your microphone for the purpose of targeted ads. Thats not ok

Too much data gathering. Would be a 5 star app if all it gathered from my phone was email and password. But this app is like spying on everything you do on your phone
Privacy. I have turned on the message request to the people i follow. I do t know why... stilli receive strangers messages      Please update tue privacy like facebook
"My review on Instagram. This app is great but their is a huge problem. Their are to many sex bots and fake accounts that are used to infect users phones with viruses, leak their IP, or get their account hacked Instagram needs to fix this problem immediately because they comment on everyones post, especially celebrities. Other than that, this app is fun to use"
"Its time for a new app to takeover. Instagram has been steadily declining over the last 6 years. Ive been on this app since 2012. They ruined the feed page algorithm. Why am I seeing posts from six days ago? Why so many ads? Why is it showing me people I dont even follow nor do I want to? BRING BACK THE CHRONOLOGICAL FEED. PLEASE. this last update is horrendous. They let us use this app for years and years to the point where its second nature to click on the post and notifications buttons within the toolbar. Now they replace it with a shopping and reels button? So I have to completely reprogram how I use this app or I will subconsciously feed into their sales scheme. HELLO INSTAGRAM, I promise you nobody downloaded this app to go shopping. This is not, nor should it ever be, a main feature on this platform. We came to this app to share photos of our lives and content with people we care about, not for you to spy on us, censor us, block content, mess with our feeds, and selfishly promote wasteful consumerism. This app is no longer user friendly for sharing content. I hope Instagram realizes they are digging their own grave by not listening to user complaints. Social apps lose their power all the time. Instagram, youre next"
"Instagram will breach your privacy. So I never gave instagram a permission to access my contacts yet every time I have a new costumer they suggest it for me on the app???? How is this possible if I dont allow them to access my contacts??So good job Instagram on offering my personal account to all of my costumers, and technically this is a privacy breach"
Data not working. I have an unlimited plan. My data works with every other app fine. Except for Instagram. Not sure what the issue is or if anyone else experiences this
Instagram. I cant post pictures unless Im on WiFi it doesnt work on my data and I dont get updates all the time
"Accessing Camera w/o Permission. I use this app daily however if you quit the app, and then go in and out / and or switch users. Youll notice that IGs app will active the camera for a few seconds. The green dot appears for a full 1-2 seconds. When you go into your privacy settings you can confirm that the instagram app accessed your camera without me touching the camera button. Kind of interesting.Unless you use the camera to actually take photos via the instagram app, I suggest you disable access to it, along with the mic. I usually upload to IG from my photo library vs taking photos directly within the app anyway"
"Complete trash now. They spy and pretty much became Facebook. They use your info and sell it without your permission. They block almost everything people post Or mark it fake even when its not yet allow pedophiles to post sick stuff, murders rapes and killings or anything anti American or anti Trump is ok. It doesnt always work and they took my money for an ad and then said they couldnt run it because people may misunderstand what results they may get from the service my business provides after I TRIED to boost an ad for a real picture I took of my work"
Why wont it work with data. My Instagram doesnt work unless its connected to internet why??
"dystopian data mining app. Average occasional instagram user here. This app will no longer let me open it unless i submit a 360 degree scan of my face and head. Not only do i not have a working camera on my phone and it wont let you upload one, i wouldnt do this anyway. What good use could they possibly have for this?  Is someone checking each scan individually?  How can they verify its the account holders face beinging scanned? Feels like an obvious privacy / identity breach. No way around this, no alternate way to verify ID, so i guess i cant use the app anymore. Bye Meta"
"An Idea & minor inconveniences. Id say it needs a fun feature... *being able to choose the profiles that we interact with*. If I follow 750 users, aprox. and only get to scroll through 50 of them, I definitely want to pick the ones that Ill see the most. Oh, and I havent been able to change my profile picture, or bio because it says error. With wifi/data.Also, my notifications dont show &amp; the settings are on. Just minor details that could boost the consistent use and development of the application"
Instagram. Suggestions and Suggested2 big privacy issue and complain Please remove it
Very private. I love IG because it is very private not much people can download your pix so thank you great app
"Major privacy and safety concerns. My privacy rights has been violated on this app on numerous occasions. Ive reached out to the administrators to fix this issue...However, I have yet to receive any response. Be very careful on this app...its not the safest place (especially, for children). Ive been cyber bullied for 7 months straight and no one seem to have any sort of answers for me to rectify this situation. For a social media platform that is open for individuals of all ages, it seriously has way too many safety and privacy concerns that needs to fixed ASAP. I use to love this app, but now I do not recommend this app at all"
Avoid if you value privacy. Data mining app
"If i could give 0 i would. Instagram has ZERO customer support. There is absolutely NOBODY available to talk to in person. you think that such a huge company would at least put in some effort in this area, i know for a fact that they have the resources to do so. I lost access to my account that i have had for 7 years when it got hacked and nobody will help me regain it. all of their forms and help centers are completely useless. they dont care that all of my personal information is at risk in the hands of a hacker. ever corner i search i come back disappointed and disrespected. Meta as a whole is run by stingy and useless people who dont give two s**ts about their customers"
You need to do better on scammers and people stealing peoples photos. You need to remove accounts that are being told  to you in your inbox you need to read it and take it seriously why have  to end up in a law suit or court  because you didnt take it seriously if you can worry about someone getting likes third parties and stuff going against guidelines then explain why someone stealing peoples identities is not an issue or against guidelines ? There has been an account floating around for days and over 4 hundred people have reported it it seems personal to me
Followers. I love the app i just don&#39;t like the fact that people can come into my profile and check who has followed me recently since it is sorted by the latest follower first.  Wheres the privacy? It doesn&#39;t make sense
"Update. People use different apps with dedicated functions for a reason. No one wants 1000 different things in one app. Why do you think a lot of people do not use Facebook anymore? Its messy and bogged down, not to mention- ridden with algorithm issues, ads and privacy concerns. Instagram is a photo sharing app, or at least it was originally. The simplicity of it was attractive and enjoyable. Turning the app into a discount tiktok, an online store, and messenger, with ads every two posts, is not making anyone happier. Listen to what the users want from THIS app, instead of shoving mediocre, unnecessary features that mimic other, already preferred apps. Thank you Facebook for continually disappointing your users Youve pushed away millions from your original creation, and youre doing it again now that you own Instagram"
"Instagram is great except. Its owned by a corporation that spies on its users, collects their personal data and sells it with impunity. It supports and profits from the spread of false, harmful and hateful news. Would be a perfect 5 out of 5 otherwise"
"Two New Useless Tabs: Reels and Shop. Overall, I do like Instagram It&#39;s far from perfect though...Instagram recently added two new useless tabs to the bottom tab bar: shopping and Reels. Apparently some people use Instagram for shopping? I cant fathom why. I do the opposite: Firefox Containers and privacy features PREVENT Facebook from tracking me across the web. Why would I give them access to shopping data? As for Reels, I understand the purpose (copying another lame social app, TikTok, the way they did with Stories from Snapchat) but I want to turn it off or at least hide it in a menu. The main feature of Instagram is posting, so I want that button back in the center of the tab bar on the bottom. I do like how adding a post or story is now merged into one button, though.I still can&#39;t stand the &#34;Discover&#34; tab, which features the most annoying like/follow hunting accounts out there (many of which are just reposting photos anyway) and cannot be hidden or configured in any way. Other apps on my phone, such as YouTube and now even Twitter, have sections like it too and it seriously needs to stop. An option to disable or at least filter the content in that section is desperately needed for users like myself who aren&#39;t teenagers and dont care about following random accounts hunting for followers and likes as if that mattered even the slightest.Imagine how awesome an iPad-native version of Instagram would be They could take the easy route and just scale everything up (which would still be better than the low-resolution mess it is now when running the iPhone app on the bigger screen) or take advantage of the increased screen real estate and make something truly special that delivers more content on-screen. (Imagine a grid of posts in the feed That would look glorious, especially on the larger iPads such as my 12.9 screen) Im hoping for the latter, but at this point I really just want Instagram to be iPad native at all.Users have been asking for Instagram to be iPad native for years, yet theyre headed backward... Instagram has joined Twitter in the Apple Watch graveyard now, with the app being automatically removed from my Watch when updating. To be fair the app wasnt particularly useful on watchOS to begin with, but removing it is annoying and inconvenient; the best part of the Watch app was the ability to see photos in the notifications you get for friends posting that you have post notifications on for. Now the notifications just tell users a photo was posted without showing what it is, which is useless without any way to view them on the Watch now.I fail to see why Instagram needs 1.02 GB of local storage on my device just to remember my login information and connected social accounts. There&#39;s got to be post caches in there taking up most of that, and if they&#39;re going to take up that much there NEEDS to be a setting to purge cached photos/videos from my device without having to delete and redownload the app. I DO NOT NEED A GIGABYTE OF CACHED INSTAGRAM POSTS ON MY PHONE. For goodness sake, even Snapchat lets you wipe your caches. The fact that even that garbage app does but Instagram doesnt is just embarrassing.The Instagram team also took the time to add some useful yet redundant features to manage your time using the app. Thats important for sure, but ultimately useless with Screen Time in iOS 12 and later. I feel like they could better spend their time on other much needed improvements to the app. (LET US CLEAR POST AND STORY CACHES BRING IPAD SUPPORT)Oh, and we still need the option to go back to a chronologically-ordered feed. Im doubting thatll happen at this point, but that doesnt mean it shouldnt.Lastly, an idea for the team: How about a new Instagram Kids app, or a kids mode for the main app? The goal of that would primarily be to shield kids from the rampant under-enforcing of adult content on the Instagram platform that they dont seem to care at all about, and it could also give parents the type of control over the experience that Facebook does with Messenger Kids. That would be a great step forward for a company that could desperately use a fresh dose of positive public image. While theyre at it, they could introduce a safe mode to predict and blur potential adult content for users in the main app that dont want to see it when theyre scrolling through their feed Now theres a feature Id use"
"Not a good first impression. Recently Ive gotten Instagram and from my point of view nothing will load. I havent been able to get on it all week because of this. Ive also tried everything in my power to make it work, from restarting my phone, logging in again, updating the app, etc. This is also disappointing because the new accounts do not have the add yours feature. (When seriously everyone is using it and you want to hop on the trend to but you cant because the app itself will not let you). Also if anyone were to blame the poor connection on not having service and WiFi I would like to make it clear that I have never had a problem with the data/WiFi company Ive been with for the past 2 years. Please fix this"
"Privacy settings are a joke. Want an App that says condoning rape is A-okay by their community guidelines, then this is the app for you. Thanks Instagram for your garbage privacy settings that dont work Whats the point in turning off tagging ability if youre just going to still notify me. Lets also just let trolls post wantonly about where someone lives, take your sweet time to review posts and still do nothing. If I could give zero stars I would"
"How is this app spying and so many ads. Despite having mic and camera off and using a phone specifically ONLY for this app alone. The ads are STILL super specific as if they are hearing my conversations or have access to what I search online on OTHER DEVICES? Super shady and intrusive Also, every other post is an ad I already cancelled my facebook. IG youre one step away from getting cancelled to"
"Horrible app run by liberals and radical left. You cant say anything here without Instagram saying its against our policy. Where is the freedom of speech? Are we living in a democratic society or communist authoritarian states? Fix your damn rules. Its gotten worse and worse to a point where I can say anything without instagram taking it down or sending me warnings. Btw dont leave personal information there, the police could track it to your house"
"I hate it here, Im leaving. STOP TRYING TO TURN INSTAGRAM INFO FACEBOOK It died for a reason Stop changing the layout to be WORSE I dont want to shop on Instagram, I want easy access to my notifications, tag searches, and posting, not peoples reels. Stop trying to fix stuff that isnt broken just to try and make us more addicted to this awful social platform that you actively change the algorithm of to screw over its creators that dont post memes or lewds I hate this platform, and Im ditching the millisecond something better comes along. I hate it here The least you stupids could do is have this garbage waste of my phone space actually function, but I guess that was too hard to do considering your the same people who cant upgrade the ZuckBots processing power enough to prevent him from selling my information to the Chinese"
"No Touch ID. Pleeeease allow users to enable Touch ID. I see no reason why other fb owned apps like Messenger and WhatsApp should have a Touch ID option but not Instagram. Honestly, as if collecting ALL my data wasnt enough, at least allow me to secure my account. Its even offered on the Android app"
"User Support and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL. I have had CONSTANT issues with my personal Instagram account that I have had for over 8 YEARSThe other day, a friend of mine posted that he bought a new car.  When I went to comment Niceeeeeee, Instagram immediately removed it.  It no longer allows me to follow new people I meet, it tells me Im in violation of community standards, even though I am simply not.  I can no longer post stories on my page, or anything at all.  I can only privately message people.  How is a company allowed to be run like this?  How in the world are they allowed to feed me ad after ad but not help me fix my account?  I have never seen a company give customers the middle finger like Instagram gives its users.  They messed their algorithm up and took away chronological ordered posts, they took away the following activity tab, and they keep shadowbanning peoples accounts.  Its annoying, and it shows they dont care about their consumers.  If you want my recommendation, use another social media app. There are rumors that the number of likes are going to be disappearing from the program"
Hacked. Look Im getting tired of Facebook and you guys somebody hacked my Facebook that they hacked my Instagram and I cant even get a new one so somehow you guys going to help me out because Im getting tired of this I lose all my data and all my friends and family because of this
"Poor app , tracks your every moves. Beware of INSTAGRAM  it will screw your brain, track your every actions on every website  send you alerts telling you you have messages when you dont. This is the most perverted app there is and of course if it a Facebook products  use it more than 10 mns a days and your brain will be filled with cretinistic hazard. Shame society and the human race have reached such a low point"
"What a disgusting update. Well we can clearly see what Instagrams priorities are by adding a whole shop section and putting it where the notifications used to be and also putting the reels in the very center, thus kicking out the central part of Instagram  posting photos to share with the world. It sickens me to see this new change because all the app is concerned about is keeping users on for as long as possible, luring them in to buy things they dont need, and keeping them engaged with all kinds of ads. While barely showing photos from people they follow. Its ridiculous. I use VSCO to post personal photos now because the lack of ads, likes, followers etc is SO much appealing to me but it saddens me to see Instagram take such a corporate route because it used to be my favorite. Not anymore. Change it back. Make the connectivity and sharing aspect the main goal again. Thank you"
"Too many ads. Sometimes I dont even bother coming on this app because all I get is advertisement and dont get to see  posts that I want to see.  Its super creepy that you guys recommend people for me to follow. I dont want follow someones dont know/ famous etc.  I want to follow my own people. Im really disappointed that this has turned into a huge advertisement. Also, Instagram oversteps by signing into my Amazon account. So many privacy issues with Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all of the social media apps"
"Great way to engage with our community. As a gym, getting to see our members share their goals and successes is so incredible. Instagram allows us to connect with our members outside our brick and mortar business. Sharing announcements, keeping members informed and sharing testimonies are just some of the fun ways we use this platform"
Instagram. Great app. I like it for personal use and I can also use it to market my business and help generate sales. Love it
"-. If you post the truth or a real aspect of truth on certain Topics such as for example: The Phoenix Program- CIAs terror program in Vietnam, or how Americas Top officials after WW II recruited and imported Nazi/Fascist into America in Operation overcast and Operation Paperclip, or Under the Grace Commission Report during the Reagan Administration, revealed quote,  With two-thirds of everyone\'s personal income taxes wasted or not collected, 100 percent of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the Federal debt and by Federal Government contributionstotransferpayments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their Government. Simply this platform only helps everyone promote and advertise, but punishes and undermines those who only wish to inform"
Recommend posted. What are you doing in my feed? I feel no privacy
An elaborate and distracting way to collect your data and send you targeted advertising. Years will pass and youll have missed everything of consequence. Delete the app. Live your life
Love it but needs more flexibility. But Since you can have more than one account I wish that we can decide which Facebook page we want that account to post to. For instance I have a professional Facebook page and a personal Facebook page. But when you have several accounts on Instagram it only allows you to choose one
Help me. I have unlimited data and yet I havent been able to use my Instagram account it keeps saying I have no internet and Id like to know why????

"Extremely user unfriendly. I am a small Instagram artist who has been using this platform since 2016. Ive noticed that my art has went from getting around 20 to 30 likes to around 10 maybe 15 likes at the most. And I think I have a very good reason for it.The algorithm and interface on this platform is an absolute joke. The shopping and reels tab have replaced the posts and notifications tab, moving them to the top right of the page.  Last time I checked Instagram wasnt a shopping site or a tiktok knock off My feed is littered with suggested posts and ads. I see content from people I follow for a few posts before they suggest me posts; which is fine because Im an artist but there is no way to turn it off or switch it to older posts by default. Thats what the explore feed is for. Which doesnt seem to work when I refresh it. And dont even get me started about the report system. It takes forever to report something illegal or truly harmful but if its over a stupid opinion or using an action too much youre caught. Get your priorities straight Overall if you want to use this app to get popular, I would not recommend it. They promote influencers and big name companies while leaving artists struggling to survive.Update: So now there are rumors of Insta being turned into a video sharing platform to compete with TikTok... Just... why? So the account I had for five years was all a waste? Im thinking of starting over and moving to Twitter or Tumblr if this is true. Instagram is not failing because its not TikTok. Its failing because its doing unnecessary updates and not listening to its consumers. I would give this zero stars if there were an option"
HACKED. If you get hacked consider your account gone because Instagram wont allow their users to contact them via phone. My account was hacked
Human Trafficking Application. They track and sell your data and suppress freedom of speach and information. Owned by China
"Terrible and no customer service. Ever since FB bought Instagram its gone downhill. Tried updating my information today and now Im locked out of my business page with thousands of followers. Theres no way to contact anyone through the phone or even email, and Ive tried everything on the trouble shooting page. I am going to be done with Instagram indefinitely and unfortunately theres no way to delete my account which will stay up forever I guess. A true disappointment. Facebook does not care about your privacy or the information you have access to. Despicable. The saddest thing is theres nothing anyone can do about it anymore. I will be deleting my Facebook page as well, I no longer want this corporation leaching of me and my info. Screw you Facebook and Instagram"
"Hacked. If you get hacked, instagram will not help you. Its very easy to get hacked. I would suggest just not bothering with the app"
"Reels and Suggested Accounts Makes Me Want To Delete The App And Cancel My Account. No matter how many times I try and filter out Reels content of annoying teenagers screaming, singing, and dancing, it never goes away. I realize theyre trying to compete with Tik Tok but know your audiences and stop shoving irritating content in peoples faces no matter how many times they say they dont want to see it. Either use the data from flagging something Not Interested  or give people and option of filtering out Reels content.Also the switch of forcing suggestions in your feed is also confusing and irritating. The number of times I caught myself swiping and looking at a post that I thought was my friends but turns out to be some ad for a rando account. Just add a new button and leave the chronological personal feed alone.Ive already removed Facebook and WhatsApp from my phone because of my dissatisfaction with the company and how they treat users, news, politics. Each time Instagram strays further and further from its pre-acquisition product and more of an advertising platform for Facebook I dont want to use it. Every time they try and become a clone of Snapchat, Tik Tok or whatever social media app the young people are using, I just feel like deleting all my content and removing the app from my phone"
"Two factor authentication. DO NOT USE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. I have lost access to my account because Instagram support is useless and keep sending the same automated reply asking for more information when I literally sent them an entire paragraph of personal information about the account like the phone numbers used to make the account, the device I used, when it was made, the email. Etc. Ive told them I dont have access to the email I used to create the account because its seven years old and not one Ive ever used. The email I am messaging them on has literally been on the account for about 6 years. They refuse to help me and because this account doesnt have personal photos of me I cant prove my identity this way. The only reason Ive lost access is because my phone broke really suddenly so I cant get onto the authentication app. This account is seven years old and they expect me to know every single tiny bit of information. I will no longer use 2FA authentication which obviously makes my account vulnerable but Im not prepared to lose any more accounts because Instagram cannot sort this issue out. If you look online you will see Im not the only person to lose accounts because of 2 factor authentication and Instagram refusing to help them. I will now probably have to lose an account Ive had for seven years"
"Dont waste your time. How does a multi billion dollar company produce an app that cant even buffer video correctly? I have no problems with any other app, but Instagram reliably wastes my time by failing to load videos and images. Worse, it will play a tiny clip and then stop, and then start again, then stop, so I dont even get the experience of watching the video even if I wait for it.On top of that, theyre very clearly using all of our content to invade our privacy and sell us to advertisers. Ive stopped sharing my own content with them because Im sick of being a product theyre selling to their real customers, while they practically flaunt their disregard for the people who use their app"
"I love it better than Facebook. Instagram to me is better and more informative than Facebook It secures your privacy and have more opportunities to see things than any other social media app there is and thats why I like it more. Also youre able to socialize with people more on a personal level than Facebook. Without going to messenger, its just a better operation no obligation. Less identification to be stolen on Instagram than Facebook so its cool.  The only dislike I have is when you block someone they are still allowed to see you. I was told. I hope that changes, otherwise its cool "
Organize. Its easy to use and great privacy
Too Much Control. Ive always loved Instagram since its beginning. As time as past I know the app has to adapt to the changing times. BUT The control that they try to put over regular people is ridiculous Now your limited on liking pictures and videos?? But your not limited to the amount of time you spend on there watching and looking at content They want you to be stuck on the app so they can get better numbers and data on you But if you dare try to use his platform to grow and be out spoken they will try to silence you I could go on for days I still love the app for certain things (like i could never get enough pictures of cars so they got me there) but i dont like what its becoming over time Use it wisely
The update is crap. Do not recommend. I havent seen any of my friends posts in MONTHS. This new algorithm only shows influencers/celebrities or meme accounts and thats if youre not staring at the same 6 adds that have been picked for you. The posts are not in chronological order anymore. After about 10 posts itll tell you youre all caught up (which youre not because I have yet to see any real posts from my friends or smaller art accounts I follow even though I know theyre posting) and then youll see a bunch of suggested posts or people to follow which I could find if I went on the explore page so its extremely dumb that thats on my main page now. ALSO they added a shopping tab where notifications used to be. Talk about sell out. Instagram has just turned into a new online shopping platform completely defeating the purpose of the app. This app is supposed to be about sharing pictures/videos/moments and instead its turned into an online flea market bombarded with ads. 0/10. Take my advice and do not bother. There are so many other social media platforms you can use
Privacy and Palestine. Privacy issues galore. Bias towards Israel and censoring posts for Palestine. 1 star
Security issues. Instagram has been great and I have been using it since it came out. However recently I think there have been some major security issues as two of my accounts have gotten hacked in the last two months. Please fix this issue or Ill have to delete the app due to privacy breaching
Deactivated account. Instagram deactivated my account and never notified me. After numerous attempts to recover it using their platform. Sending pictures with emailed codes to them and requesting reviews. Nothing. Its been 3 weeks and I still do not have access to my account. All my pictures from the past 7+ years are now gone. If you plan on using this social media platform be prepared to lose access and have no way of getting it back. Back up your data. Save your pictures somewhere secure
Tab. I dont like that new tab that youve got where save find friends and insights are this app is getting too hard to use on here might have to uninstall soon still cant see who viewed my story after 24 hrs also should be more privacy options like you should be able to choose who sees your posts. Why is my personal account glitch its saying Ive got new likes and followers when I havent its from my other account Instagram is really going downhill get the old owner back. Igtv icon has disappeared from my main account on home :(
Followers Privacy. Overhaul Im happy with the app. it will be really cool if the followers can go hidden from a public/work profile
Screenshot Update. The new story and messages screenshot update is completely inappropriate and an absolute violation of privacy. i dont know whos idea it was but it was an irresponsible one. What is instagram turning into ?? a dictatorship? its turning into an app im starting to hate using especially because of this update. my heart is broken. 
Followers. They need to make an app to track who unfollows you
"no. as in FB, they spy on your life, file it, sell it, and sensor it with fact checkers that are actually agenda pushers #dirty"
Instagram is a mess. As someone who used Instagram to get a business following and also for personal reasons its a shame to see what a mess this platform is. From the constant changing algorithm which means you can never really engage followers to now turning into a shopping site. I dont understand why this is necessary. Give back people the platform they love and enjoy using
"Focus on your users not making money. Instagram used to be great because of the authentic and the personal photos people would share. I understand you want to make money but why change the core focus of your platform (sharing photos) to primary shopping and adds. This is why other platforms such as TikTok are taking over, because people can share and see authentic content. Every third photo on my feed is an ad"
Privacy. I dislike that I cant hide my friends likes  from my page
Review. Instagram is very useful for personal and professional purposes. Very user-friendly
CANT GET ANY HELP. ive requested help so many times on my account because i cannot repost things on my instagram story  ive checked my privacy settings numerous times and i just dont have the option anywhere to repost things and it is the most frustrating thing ever 
"Do Not Download This App. Up until recently, Ive been an avid user of Instagram for over a decade, but no longer. They have shown that their priority is to increase shopping, making it harder for people both to post and view posts. Theres nothing but designed artificiality on every page. MORE IMPORTANTLY, Instagram has updated their terms of use so that they can spy on your texts, searches, calls, etc. They can watch you through your camera. They can deactivate your account for having a username that sounds like a domain name (which could be any and all usernames). They are out of control. Its not worth it. Do not download this app and just text your friends instead"
"Data data data. Its cool to get relevant ads, but what are you NOT showing me?"
"Instagram issue. I really hate how my Instagram ONLY works when Im on wifi and I have mobile data, its soooo annoying"
"Copyright Work Stolen. My instagram account was hacked All the security measures failed, instagram has denied my ID process, Copyright Claim, an every way I can to recover the account. Absolutely insane, do not connect you Cellphone number to your account ever 2FA will fail you"
"Gets worse every day. Between the ad posts and stories, shopping tab, obvious selling of mined data, and direct influence in risking the physical and mental health safety of its users, I find fewer reasons to use Instagram on a seemingly daily basis, and would never recommend someone become a new user"
"Instagram. It is not as fun as it used to be. I find it more difficult to post anything and if I want to post a picture from my library, it takes all the pictures before it. Those pictures are private and I want them to stay that way"
"Increase Your Audience Organically. Social media is awesome and with Instagram its Being part of an large online circle of  Entrepreneurs that are discovering and  sharing  personal stories and information. Here you get to engage and meet new people, build new relationships and meet new friends.  Instagram is also a great resource if youre looking for maximum engagement"
Data takeout doesnt work. I used to love Instagram but it has become a real mess. Too many features now make it cluttered and an assault on my senses. So much so that I decided to take out my data from the platform and head elsewhere. But the feature for doing so doesnt work Ive tried to take out my data twice and nether attempt has worked. Please fix this
"More privacy options needed. I like the app, except for the fact that anyone can see the pages you follow. We should be able to make that private"
"They disabled my account of 7 years. I was asked to give instagram my phone number as a security check/verify my account. It then made me log out and now says it has been disabled for violating community guidelines. I was using another app to track who I follow that doesnt follow me, but Instagram hasnt given me a chance to get my account back. I have had this account for 7 years and all my memories from high school are on it. Disappointing"
IG loves and supports hackers. Instagram is clearly for the hackers and against regular people they allowed my account to be hacked and I was on it when I noticed it happening they allowed this person to change my email and lock me out and now the entire app doesnt work I cant like pictures I cant change the number associated because it will not send me a code I cant do anything I have IG
"Communists. They can now access alot on your phone even when not using the app,and part of big techs plan to spy on conservatives and censor them"
Keep it up. I love Instagram I can post photos videos and more I have multiple accounts for work but I wish you could have accounts hooked all in one account for example one of my accounts can have all the other accounts with that account Its hard to keep track and having multiple accounts even if its for work Otherwise than that its a great app I love Instagram and I will keep using it The only thing is I wish Instagram wouldnt count posts the only thing I think Instagram has to work on is get rid of counting posts and then it would be a greater app newer social medias dont keep track or count posts1. Get rid of counting posts
"IDENTITY THEFT AND ACCOUNT RECOVERY. Instagram needs to do a better job with helping people get their accounts back. It also needs to do a better job at disabling accounts who hack other accounts and obtain other peoples information using their identity to sponsor themselves. Lately there has been a lot of people on instagram getting scammed by forex traders who steal other peoples money and identity and take over their personal account to fool others to invest. Accounts have been reported plenty of times and nothing has been done to prevent this from being done to someone else. Cant even enjoy a post with out having bots and fake bitcoin traders fill the comments with non sense. Improvise your security please. Instagram doesnt feel like home anymore. There are alot of people who have not been able to get their indentities, money, and account back"
I love Instagram but I know this review would get no where. You guys must stop playing with us. You block and unblock people as you please like we have no right to follow and unfollow as much people as we please on our pages we buy data for
"Dont Get this app . Instagram has updated. If we have the app we lose our privacy. They have access to our texts, search history, camera, microphone, etc. They are gonna be watching you 24/7 and if u have the app, they are watching you now. Collect everything you have on there and delete it. Idc how many followers you have, delete it. Never get back on that app, never go on the website. This is disgusting. Minors have this app and they are invading privacy. Honestly, this is beyond SICK. What disgusting people watch MINORS change, watch what they search, what they text, etc"
Hackers . Im going to be honest are you going to fix something about the hackers because many people cannot stand it do something about that because it making people really mad just understand do something about that its not that hard do something about that we have many hackers on Instagram and people cannot stand it no more and please do something with a Instagram I like it a lot but you have to do something with those hackers being peoples privacy thats not cool bro do something about it thats why you got 3 star Because of me my second account get hacked you better do something about that now I had to do a new one are you serious right now fixed it please
"Account deletion. No explanation, warning was given. Deleted my account of so long. I dont need Instagram. I have other apps I may use to contact friends and fam. But whats creepy. Is how the account is still existent. And its just grayed out. Clearly they are keeping my info without my consent. Delete my data Instagram. Big brotherish of you"
"Just want to see feed in chronological order. See posts from 5 minutes ago then to 3 days ago? Always try to expand info and it shows me who likes a picture (who cares) currently searching for a time waster app so I can delete insta, the data harvesting app that cant even get me 1 ad for clothes Id like to wear. In the garage along with toxic twitter"
Ads. The nature of the ads is predatory and creepy theyre all about unhealthy weight loss or personal things Ive spoken about privately. Nice to know nothings personal anymore 
Community guidelines enforcement is a joke. Being wrongfully accused of violating community guidelines. Posted on my story saying Hewwo with a picture of Bubbly sparkling water soda can tabs. Flagged for bullying. Shared screenshot of the flagging. Flagged for bullying. Shared screenshots  of screenshots of flagging. Flagged for bullying. Shared meme about NASA and data used to process to send ppl to the moon vs the Pc and how slow it is to boot up chrome. Flagged for bullying. Instagram just straight up gaslighting me now and they are the ones being bullies. Very disappointed.I come with receipts. My IG is Athenova. Instagram we need to talk
No good. No privacy
"Why facebook. Ever since fb has taken over Instagram, this app has gone to sht...my security and privacy has depleted and left me HACKED, the new shopping button is sooo stupid like who comes on this app to shop???? And overall I hate hate hate Facebook and the creator of Facebook, I left that app years ago bc I dont trust him and now he owns the app I actually liked and used....I hate this update and I really could care less about zuckerberg or whatever his name is"
"Chronological order and shopping/likes button. Instagrams alright but I would love it so much more if the pictures on my feed were in chronological order and if the shopping/notifications buttons were not updated, I liked having quick access to my notifications- I often miss my notifications now because I dont see it which is annoying. Not to mention that I dont even like shopping on Instagram, Ive never bought anything off Instagram and dont think I will"
Instagram should be deleted by everyone. Not being able to get rid of suggested posts and constantly being shown advertisements is the reason Im going to find another app for social media. Instagram also uses your data and sells it to ad companies. Its time to leave the application for something better
Tracking me a lot. Even if i am not using instagram I might find ads connected to something I said in real life It freaked me out
"Instagram. Its a fun and enjoyable app to socialise and connect with friends, its also a good idea that everyone is keeping safe with private info, I think its very in needed to take away how many likes but over all I enjoy the app and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 11"
suggestion. please make an option for us to see who doesnt follow us back I dont want to use a third party app to track this as it could potentially hack my instagram
"Deceptive and spy. When you talk to a friend about something, you will be surprised by the increase in advertisements about what you talked about.And Hashtags are being manipulated"
"Deactivated accounts. I ran a successful fan page for almost two years. I had it listed as a fan page, which Instagram lets you do. I was deactivated Dec 15th with no warning at all. I never had any bans or restrictions. I was disabled for Pretending to be someone else. Why does insta list fan page as an option if it apparently goes against their guidelines?? I have appealed several times and have yet to get a decision. All I ever get is a robotic response with the appeal link I already filed. Even though my page represents someone else, under my personal info is my real name and bday, it matches my license which I was asked to send a copy of. Crickets I was also asked for a selfie with a code, I did this many times. When will they ever answer their appeals? People work hard on their accounts and do not deserve this"
"İnstagram doesnt care about mental health. Hello there,Ive been trying reach out to you guys forever.It seems like İnstagram doesnt care about mental health?Im trying to delete my old promotion that never got approved but it doesnt go away and because of that i cannot go private. I simply get delete the promotion. It keeps giving me errorI want to go private and there is a glitch in İnstagram that doesnt allow me go back to private.This shouldnt be so hardIm already going very hard times at the moment and i want to go private due personal reasons and my public İnstagram gives me anxiety.Im asking for help, please"
Terms and conditions. I read the terms and conditions and theyre just awful. This app does nothing to protect your privacy and literally admit to not being able to sue them for anything because of agreeing to the terms and conditions. They need to do better
"Copyright issues. As a personal Instagram, its great. As a business, Instagram needs to step up their game Especially when using music to make reels, adding music to pictures. Etc. You can using music but not any of the popular music or the famous recording artist Only as a personal account or as a creator; or so Ive read. It would help my business out tremendously to be able to use popular music. I  reached out to IG months ago, & never heard back about the issue. Anyway thats my main issue at the moment. Please fix it"
Posting pictures or videos. Please update the privacy setting that we can block some friends if we dont want our friends to see our posts.  That would be better and very convenient for those who want to post it comfortably
"Report a Problem. My news feed and explore page wont load and ive tried wifi and data, deleting the app, logging out, restarting my phone, etc. I reported a problem on instagram and havent heard anything back in a couple days"
"Personal account request. Hello InstagramThank you you for giving me the opportunity ,I would like to mention that i dont have access or choice to add music when i do stories and when i tag people on my stories or posts there is not any visibility through them"
Tracking turned off but app still doing it. I do not allow Instagram to track my activity across other apps. But I used a different app recently to search for flights and Instagram a day later shows me an add for the city I booked a flight for. Facebook as a company is utterly reprehensible
Hacked. I got hacked and it sent messages to literally everyone I follow on Instagram sending them hacks and it deleted my messages and I feel like my privacy has been invaded. Its very annoying and its not what I expected from you guys
"Not the same app as it once was. Instagram used to be a place of genuine cultural and social interaction. However lately it has become way to monetized with companies stealing other peoples content and constantly trying to sell you stuff. For example the only people who post on Instagrams new reels are companies that have stolen other peoples content . When I click on Instagram I want Instagram not what Facebook is now, I dont want tiktok and I dont want to shop"
"Almost Unusable Now. As is tradition for Facebook, you ruined a good thing. Every 3 posts includes a video ad now. You&#39;re wasting my data and my time. Greedy"
"Updates. Confusing new feautures I prefer the previous version to be honest. The best part of instagram it to be able to meet like minded people , discover local artist, keep conected with friends. Hate the adds unless they are for local small businesses or peoples doing crafts or events. It does not feel secure when you get a stalker or someone crazy trying to violate your privacy or ignore your boundaries I still love it but hope it does not turn into another facebook"
"Deleted Instagram after 8 years. Since theyve changed their new privacy policy recently, and since theyve allowed independent  fact checkers and the censorship of free speech Ive deleted Instagram. I dont support communist media"
"man dont mess with this. it was good until they made the whole app a money grab and turning the app into an addictive setting - making a shopping tab (who needs to buy things on instagram??), adding reels (they knew people spend countless hours on tiktok so they stole the idea), removing the ability to share share the reels ur watching (not sure what the point of this feature was but its stupid), and the reels mute ur notifications while ur watching them (so nobody can distract u from sending facebook ur precious data). oh and just in case that wasnt enough, facebook is getting sued for spying on over 100 million instagram users through their cameras and claiming it was a bug ??? the app used to be good but now there is no originally to it, facebook has quite clearly RUINED what made instagram instagram"
Naw I Wouldnt. If you are a new person to social media it may be fun to add insta to ur arrange of apps. But this app stalks all your likes and comments so that it can find stuff fitting for you to see on ur time line Nd explorer page. May it be adds or someone trying to sell its very uncomfortable knowing theyre watching my every tap . Stay off it Nd just learn to exercise and stop scrolling through pictures of people youll never meet in real life
"Nobody to talk to??. I got my account hacked and attempted to call the phone number set for Instagram and it was a waste of time. Automated recording of the same information in text where the more help says. I report the account and get my friends to as well but it doesnt do anything, so the hacker keeps attempting to scam people through my account"
"Wont let me in. For the past month Ive been locked out of my instagram accounts. It isnt an account issue, they work on all other devices except for my phone. There is no real explanation for it and Ive been reduced to using the website to access my insta at all. Also instagram has little to no way to contact the company for customer support. All around this app is an absolute failure"
"Easy to use, yet trying to keep up with the competition. Hi there I just got Instagram a week ago and I will have to say, it is a great way to connect with my friends, see what they are up to and a great source for school clubs and events. However, I have heard news that Instagram is becoming a social media video sharing app instead of focused on the photo aspect. This is highly disappointing because we already have so many different apps that are MEANT for videos. A lot of my friends are artists and photographers who make money through Instagram. This is where they are most likely to switch over to another platform. I completely understand why they are doing this, but that is just gonna tear the app apart. I would like the people of Instagram to reconsider this update that is up and coming soon. Or even ohh right now, who knows. If you want to add more video features, go ahead, but please dont throw artists, business and photographers down the drain like that. Make sure to give both parties the right amount of attention. Besides that, I absolutely adore Instagram and how much security privacy it goes for private accounts such as my own. Either way, I really hope you see this Instagram and reply. I know a lot people who are considering leaving the app cause of this new update. Thank you so much for your time"
"Wish i could give zero stars. WHAT THE HECK IS THE NEW UPDATE? I am going to freaking cry. I am autistic and I dont have the organization sense to share posts on my stories with the new update. I used to help my friends grow every day by putting their posts on my story. I dont really want to use Instagram anymore, although its where I built an incredible life on my fan page and used to adore it. Also, since when are we having in app purchases in this app? Now this app is classist because of in app purchases, ableist because it is so hard for neurodivergent people to use, and just a mess in general. Reels are just a very convenient tiktok ripoff, rolled out right when tiktok might have been getting banned in the USA. Youre not subtle. I am done. Everything I said in my earlier review, posted under this one, is still true. Goodbye Instagram. Written early 2021: being left up because nothing has changed. I have two major issues with Instagram right now. What the heck is this new layout? The reason I chose Instagram as my favorite social platform a year ago was because of how simple and organized the layout was and how easy it was to use. I also only saw a few ads and they werent that persistent. I loved how organized the app felt. Now, its a mess. The new layout is clearly trying to sell products from Instagram advertisers. Its a transparent move. The layout, along with the rest of Instagram, hurts small businesses and other non-advertising accounts such as art accounts and only benefits advertisers. This brings me to my second major concern. The new algorithm makes everything harder for creators and small business owners and easier for advertisers. It has severely hurt my fan page, where I post original content. I could be at 7K followers by now at the rate I once grew, but the algorithm changed. Please give us the old algorithm and layout This app is clearly turning into a cash grab from what it used to be. P.S. Id like to see my feed in closer to chronological order Now Im seeing posts from 5 days ago on my feed. This hurts me as a fan page and I can only imagine what it does to people who make their livings with this app"
"Facebook is ruining the Instagram Feed. It was only a matter of time before Facebook&#39;s icky influence crept into the IG feed. Now we&#39;re only allowed to look at a few posts by people we actually follow before our personal feeds become awash in an endless sea of vapid influencers and corporate accounts. I mean, at least I understood forcing us to look at ads every fourth post, because that&#39;s how they make money. But forcing us to look at unwanted creator content doesn&#39;t even make them money does it? I would love to be able to delete both apps, but as a designer there aren&#39;t any comparable competitors now that Facebook has eliminated all of its competition and monopolized the market. Yay"
Not a big fan like I used to be. My other account got hacked and Instagram was no help with retrieving it as to the person who hacked my account has been stealing photos of me and my kids which makes me feel violated . And they are trying to scam my family and friends for money
Does not protect privacy and freedom. Does not protect privacy and freedom
"Nothing good for photo creators. Don&#39;t take away story reshares. If people want it gone, give them their own option to hide them. Story posts are how I find new creators to follow. I also despise the ability for others to find you based on whether you are friends on facebook or not. I want my instagram account to be for creator purposes only and I don&#39;t want people on facebook to connect thinking it&#39;s a personal account. Basically, I don&#39;t want them in my business. I also don&#39;t like the combination of messenger and instagram messages. Instagram is a completely separate platform with separate purposes and style from facebook and it should stay that way. I truly hate Instagram for these recent changes"
Ugh. Instagram made it hard for you to post and a lot other and you cant like nobody pictures .or comments and someonething all ways pop up ever 2sec its a bad app at this point. (1year later)And I have good WiFi and my phone is one and its not letting me get on my page
"There security system and support has huge flaws. This review I feel is very important to write about because Im sure Im not the only person whos had a problem with this. As most are aware Instagram tries to make its platform secure and safe as possible. So every month they usually have an update that enables the ability for users to protect themselves against hacks and being spammed. However I am writing this because unfortunately this is one of the things they need to seriously fix and improve. I personally use Instagram a lot. I go on it relatively often (maybe about 2-3hrs a day) to catch up on stuff and keep track of the following I have. I also use it for networking with individuals for internships and university related activities/events/organizations. However, because I am on it so often and like a lot of photos Instagram detects that Im a spam account. For the past three days, I have been basically locked out of my account because of there flawed two factor authentication system, which honestly half of it I think is a glitch. This system is supposed to send a code to your phone that you put to verify you own your account. However 2/3 times it kicked me out and asked to verify Ive never gotten a single code. I got lucky the first time and it fixed itself. The second time I was able to get into my account and change my number to one of my friends numbers to see if Id get a code, and it magically worked. I do not know what the problem is with Instagram and my number, but Its almost like it cant read phone number its trying to send the code to. This time around I honestly do not know if itll be fixed unless by the grace of god it magically goes away over night. This is something that needs to be seriously look into. Especially because there is no way of contacting some sort of customer service for Instagram, unless if your a well known influencer. I want my account back but I do not know if itll happen. But what I do want is change with this app, because I know Im not the only person this has happened to. They need to fix how you verify your account or just overall improve the app itself from glitching out and thinking that someone who uses the app often is a spam account. I hope this comment helps people be aware of how much usage can cause Instagram to think your account is spam. Fix this system please or look into"
Instagram. It is a great app love all the features if you get this app make sure to really watch and listen to all the notifications and so so good luck
"Meh?. Been using Instagram for a few years. From personal experience its great, but the updates recently arent it Taking away story shares is DEFINITELY something NO ONE asked for. Let us keep thoseAlso, need to make up your mind about where certain things go (such as the notifs, search page, where we can see our saved, etc)And stop giving people inaccurate warnings  tired of seeing people I follow getting warnings about buying likes and followers or something"
"Feature request. Hi, Im a very private person but I have this one talent I would like to share with everyone but not my entire personal life (I dont want to create another account). I would like a way on IG where in I can pick and choose what I want to share as a public content. Like a folder of content of my choice which I choose to share it with public. Give an overview about myself without sharing my entire profile. Also, STOP making Instagram as another Facebook. People left Facebook for a reason. Its annoying. Otherwise, good work design team. Thanks :)"
Nude content. Girls are showing their personal body parts which is not good for our society. Instagram should think on this matter as well Rest of things are good
Incredible social media platform. This is my one stop shop media outlet. Incredibly responsive and updated in seconds for accurate information
HORRIBLE. DELETE INSTAGRAM RN IT TAKES AWAY YOUR PRIVACY. IT WATCHES YOU DO EVERYTHING ALONG WITH YOUR PHOTOS AND SEARCHES
"Totalitarian App. Disabled my account for expressing my freedom of speech and broke the privacy policy which both parties agreed to, as there was not policy broken to justify the disabling of my account. It was also linked to my Facebook account which was also deleted along with all of my pictures and contacts throughout the many years of being a loyal paying customer to Facebook and Instagram. Customer service never responds and no one claims responsibility. All my contacts and information are now deleted forever. A new app/business will take advantage of this flaw in Facebooks business model. Boycott this app at all costs"
Insta is spying. Instagram is spying on us through the camera even if uur offline 
"Privacy. There should be an option to block specific followers from select posts like FB does. Posting GIFs, pictures, videos or links in comments would also be better"
Meh. Do you like to look sponsored/advertising spam or users reposting stolen pics/videos? Then youll love instagram
Instagram. Great app and enjoying it One thing work on spam accounts and tags make them private its getting annoying having to receive notifications of random tags people tag you in
"Terrible new update. Account got hacked Do a better job of security And now theres a limit of how much you can like something, ur herllo, isnt that what Instagram is for?"
"Hacked Hacked Hacked. My account was hacked and friends personal information was compromised by what these people were doing. I tried contacting Instagram to assist without any response. I can get into my account but, the hackers did something to not allow me to delete it  I am furious If you have a platform such as this consumers should have a way of contacting you"
"Bots and data security. Not sure if anyone at IG will read this (or care), but here goes... As some have already mentioned, the bot issue is completely out of control. I transitioned most of my social media activity away from Facebook to IG, because of the incessant friend requests that were clearly bots. Now Im starting to see the same issue with the daily bot messages to my DM on IG. You have multiple articles and settings around data privacy and  security, but it doesnt appear that this extends to managing the spam/bot issue. If the IG watchdogs can quickly remove music from our posts (even when were not claiming ownership or profit), why cant they do more to stop the harassment and data security issues? There is an option to report individual accounts, but Im receiving messages from multiple accounts that I KNOW are not the source the bot is just using their account. How do I report an overarching issue with IG instead of an issue with individual users? Please do better. I like IG and Id hate to see them suffer the same fate as MySpace"
Sells your data and spies on you. This app and the parent company should be banned from the App Store
"Unsatisfactory. It was not until I changed my account to a personal account and then made it private that I saw no more pornographic material. Those who oversee this social media giant do not pay attention to these things. The app also flags material that has nothing to do with the Covid-19 virus when words like shot or jab are used in different contexts. Now, my whole account freezes when I post answers to questions on my stories. Instagram used to be a great place to see pictures, share material, and connect with others. It has now become a breeding ground for the same mess that exists on all the other social media services: division. No safe spaces here-be careful what you post"
Instagram is down. Um lets see the apps been down for 24hours theres been NO statement. And your Instagram official fb page is completely over flowing with absolute hackers advising people to give their passwords to hackers via WhatsApp......... not only do some people have their business based on instagram but also private information and irreplaceable photos. And you can address that?? This breach is BEYOND forgivable
All about ads now. INSTAGRAM IS A SELL OUT ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS ADS. Literally hid the entire point of the app to share and see pictures so they could put in ridiculious amounts of shopping and ads. Its now hard to navigate as seeing your activity and posting photos is in a completely different space. I can barely see the people i actually follow because it gives so many sponsored posts and suggestions on the feed. It was my favorite app and now i hate it. Give us back the old instagram your already have enough money
"Worthless for business. Ever since FB took over its been junk I am a very active user and my actions are constantly blocked, causing me to have to waste data by having to uninstall and reinstall just to use my account But if I report an account for nudity which is a direct violation of terms you do nothing"
"Personal opinions. I think this platform is amazing to interact with friends and family and reach new people from all across the world. I however think that your deactivation algorithm if flawed as many of my posts have been taken down or removed and I have had my account deactivate and reactivated in the past, I would never breach any community guidelines and have gave you all my personal identification information but it seems on some cases you delete posts just because they have been reported, I know there are people out their who abuse your app but I am not one of this people and I think you need to regulate reports more rather than just delete stuff Thanks"
Censorship at work. If you dont subscribe to the double think you may be deleted.   This app does not need my health and fitness data. They dont need a shopping button either. Protect your children from this invasive app looks into your contact info also
"Privacy concerns. Absolutely no reason for Instagram to know Ive had chipotle recently, wasnt posted on any of their platforms. Yet I received an add asking how my recent experience at chipotle was. This is a gross invasion of privacy by both Instagram and chipotle"
"This  still uses your camera/voice even if turned off. I always had everything off. I know they are owned by Facebook, a darpa creation to spy on citizens. But its getting ducking ridiculous"
Instagram. Its a Spy app
"Going downhill. The only reason I still have this app is coz my memories of how good it was 5 years ago. Now you kept removing features that I always prioritise and adding stuff I never asked for.I understand why you would remove story viewer list after 24hrs but not the view count. I kept track of them to check who stalked me. I have means to track hackers by looking at the view count alone (limit the story to only suspected hackers etc) and since you removed that too, this doesnt make my life any easier.Not everyone is a businessman or entrepreneur. Some are just freelancers who needs the view count. Others might be just someone who wanted to keep track of their social interaction with other people. You dont understand that maybe you shouldnt have bought instagram in the first place. Shame on you"
"Not helpful app. It tracks your activities. Spam you with follower recommendations., and targeted add"
"Suggestion. Hey, I like Instagram, especially the filters that we could use and this variety in it. So I&#39;m just saying why don&#39;t you guys make an app related to Instagram and with an Instagram account to use just for taking photos and using all these filters, it&#39;s gonna be helpful. And thank you for your efforts to make it better"
"I am loving it. I was not happy with facebook bc of privacy, I found this one to fit better my social life"
"Bad security. The issue with instagram hacks is getting really bad, a large portion of people I follow have all been hacked, and now my account is too. This app is not safe or secure to use in terms of privacy. Once my account is recovered I think I will be deleting my account as the frustration is not worth it"
"Unreal. Somehow with all the access to all the data in the world and a grotesque amount of money you have managed to turn Instagram into a skeleton of what it once was. The app equivalent to a dying shopping mall filled with stores no one wants to attend. Your greed has lead you to destroying the only thing that ever gave you the money you used to destroy it. IGs board is filled with clowns, plain and simple,"
"Data consumption. It a cool app but ,it consumes data   But I would still give it a 5 star"
Instagram accessing camera without my permission. As many iPhone users may know we have a green dot show up next to the battery icon when an app is using your camera and mic. The green light went on when the camera was NOT being used on Instagram. Why is Instagram accessing my camera without my permission? I would give minus stars if I could and I will be reporting Instagram too. I doubt anything will happen from this but I just wanted to warn others. Do not trust these people when they say its a glitch. They are shady and do not care about your privacy
"Odd and bad corporate choices. Instagram has gained a bad rap for a reason and it is not simply a dislike for the trendy or the media culture but the odd turns Instagram takes to kill its own functions.  Each step with the new algorithm is an even bigger strain on users.  Especially artist and creatives. We all know what went down with YouTube and Instagram is following into the same hole.  Kill the fun and creativity users have and promote only the people or companies who make you quick money.  I  continue to use the app because it has so much to get from individuals on it. The art, the creativity, the community. But not the company or each new cool and hip capitalist functionality. I hated when Pinterest started only prompting buyable and cheap industry tagging.  I like it even less for a even more personal sharing space.  Thing Instagram has right is personalized add I finally got my to promote artist, creatives and trends I enjoy. Thats one positive And it completely a money based system. I dont need that anymore then in my personal feed and explore page.   The tag blocking was bad. Facebook is the cesspool of miss info and they think they need to block Ever single #  the whole election season on insta ¿? Who. And it Literally only affect small artist and business that depend on those to get found. Not people who spout bull anyways.  Also it keep crashing right after I finish editing all of my photos sooooo thats great to.   I hope they either stop trying to beat a dead horse (the users) and make positive changes.  Or a new platform can live long enough to provided for artists"
"SOMEONE HAS HACKED MY INSTAGRAM. I havent received any support from Instagram to get my account back there is simply no way to contact you guys. Its unfair that you are allowing people to access my private information, messages, and photosSOMEONE IS STEALING MY INFORMATION HELP IS NEEDED ASAP"
Privacy. New privacy rules-No thanks. Delete
"Net Negative Impact On Life. Instagram really needs to fix create mode in Stories so that users can arrange images, text, and/or emoji without accidentally pulling the background object into the foreground. After heavy use and a months-long break: Lots of ads, overtly steers your thoughts and behavior via feed display algorithm (contributing to countrywide political divisiveness), not a good source of important information (news, political, or otherwise), but is a good way of spreading social news and gossip, extends your sense of personal reach into the world (for me this actually ended up feeling very negative over time, but I work closely with the public and needed my personal focus to be 100% in that realm).Try an experiment and see if it adds to your life, improves your average mood, or contributes to/supports any of the goals you have in life. If it does, you will LOVE this app. If it does not, you will not feel happy and positive after periods of using this app. Because positivity and warm-heartedness are contagious, cultivating them is arguably the best thing we can do for the world. So do whatever helps you do that. It doesnt help me much. Mostly use it to blow off steam"
"Advertising. Instagram used to be simple. I could post a picture and have friends see it. In 2020, it is nothing more than a place for advertisers to sell product. I cant scroll past 3 posts before seeing sponsored content. They added stories like snapchat, short videos like vine/tik tok, and now they have an entire page that lets you shop like amazon. The core features are being neglected and it doesnt seem like Instagram cares anymore"
The best. I love IG better privacy than fb
"My Instagram has broke. Its a really good app but theres always something thats going on that isnt supposed to. Right now, I cant access my profile meaning I cant assess my other accounts. When I click on my little profile picture on the bottom, it goes to a black screen and stays that way. I have to do the double click thing to get it back to normal. However, it still goes to a black screen when I click on it, I cant get to my settings to report it. Ive tried re installing my app and restarting my phone. Please help if anyone knows how to fix it"
"Excellent platform for business and personal use. I have requested to verify my account details and I have submitted my details, I hope Instagram will look into it. I will post my reviews once I get the blue tick"
I cant get access to my instagram. My instagram was connected to Facebook and now my Facebook is hacked I cant get access to my instagram I see my profile so many time when I use my friends phone I cant get the option to speak to a customer service
Instagram Stories. I love instagram but what is the reason behind hiding our viewers on our story after 48 hours? its our own data. It&#39;s actually annoying
Biased app. Will sell your personal data to companies and spy on you. Also #___ #FREEPALESTINE
Hackers. Loads of spam and hackers. Do better and protecting peoples privacy
"Full of Censorship. Horrible, manipulative, and stealing a lot of my personal data"
Steals data & dishonest company. Sells and markets data to outsourced companies altars information claiming that its false when its true and shadow bans users when they dont like your motives even if your positive person. If company was a trust worthy company Id give more stars
"action blocked. my account got blocked for giving my information to an app or someone to gain more followers, likes and comments, which i didnt. i&#39;ve been reporting accounts that are spam here and i got blocked from liking, unfollowing, following, commenting, all of that"
"Dont spam my phone. Hey, if I allow an app to send me notifications, and then select the type of notifications I allow, and then I get notifications that are effectively adds for Instagram littering my notifications. Please fix this. This is the type of clutter I try to avoid as theyre just distractions"
Ruining itself. They really want to be tiktok which we just dont need because we already have and they have terrible customer service if u get hacked and change info u will never get ur account back & they just do random annoying things like if you switch to a business/creator account you literally have to post a picture to fully switch with no option to skip? Ive been using this since the tan and brown days and while its gotten better I think they will kill Instagram themselves ultimately
Best social media ever. By far the most best social media platform ever one thing I really want is a passcode for the app so my parents dont go through my privacy Please can you do this Thanks
"SAY NO TO INSTAGRAM. Instagram is the WORST social media app out right now. There is absolutely no costumer service help. They have had a 24 hour review on my account for THREE DAYS, with no email or message explaining why I am experiencing this abuse. I know that Instagram has maliciously and illegitimately have done this 24 hour review on a lot of people. TERRIBLE COMPANY. They ban accounts, steal data, and information, and dont have the decency to give a legitimate answer to why. Who knows what or who they are selling our pictures, videos and databases to. They are not publishers, but they act like they are. Instagram is a costumer of the consumer, not the other way around. Definitely Boycotting Instagram. Worst social media platform EVER"
Who doesnt love insta?. 5 stars but it would be 4.9999 because of all the adds and basically spyware haha. If you say computer in convo your phone will distribute the info to instagram and they gear their ads toward you
"Where are you taking this app?. Ive used Instagram for years practically since it first came out. It was unique, fresh, very easy to use and it felt very personalised and made with love and care that made it feel very welcoming and really fun to use. Over years it seems its feels like its no longer Instagram it feels like a carbon copy  of other apps such as Tik-Tok with the reels/short quick videos, Facebook, Snapchat with the stories and so the list goes on. Its all mishmashed together to create this Whatever this app is meant to be now. It feels so forced and rough around the edges, its trying too hard to fit into something that its clearly not. It was originally a place where people can share photos, it could be from personal photos of your day to day, to photographs of amazing places that people wanted to share, to people sharing works of art to get their name out there. Its essentially like your team, your app is literally having a life crisis. Your app used to be so original and it had a purpose and it worked really, really well. In my personal opinion I honestly wonder if it will last another couple of years. Because I cant see where your taking this app anymore. Questions: Where do you see the future of this app? What do you plan to do this app? Do you think of updates with your personal audience in mind when you are planning what will come next? Do you even think about your audience?Do you consider what your audience would like you to do with this app?"
Dineshtony. Super social media but fastly exhausting data 
"Hacked accounts. 3 of my co workers got there accounts hacked during the weekend. They start messaging people saying help. If you answer and they say we are trying to retrieve their ig account but need your help. If you say yes, they proceed to giving you instructions like your gonna get a link screenshot it and send it to them. This just makes me fear instagram is becoming less and less secure with our personal information we provide them when making an instagram account"
"Addictive and Decreases Self-Efficacy. Open your eyes people. Go outside. Breathe. Experience the world. I would much rather talk to someone in person and hear about what they did instead of posting everything online until I have nothing to do with my friends other than sit around and scroll through my phone. I downloaded this app again because I have to for school. Smh my head. If Instagram or social media is your default boredom cure then I guarantee you have unused potential that you can use to do amazing things for both yourself and others. If you use Instagram for your business or as a place to post vacation pics then fine, but it is certainly not the most secure place to be posting sensitive or personal data. Happiness doesnt come from other people, it comes from within. Have a great day, and if you have time to read this entire review, you certainly have time to go on a walk for fifteen minutes alone with your thoughts and reflect on life"
Too much data gathering. Would be a 5 star app if all it gathered from my phone was email and password. But this app is like spying on everything you do on your phone. Also very  addictive :/ dont recommend
"Such a shame. Instagram easily became the biggest media app when it comes to updating exclusively through photo/videos. It&#39;s all be completely sold out and mainstreamed. Following people means nothing because you never see their posts. We&#39;re literally flooded with videos we don&#39;t care about, ads, spam, basically everything except what we want to see. Let&#39;s not even get started on censorship of this stupid app. The inconsistencies of posts that are allowed vs what they take down are unfathomable. It used to be such a beautiful, I really can&#39;t wait for it&#39;s replacement"
Horrible. This is a horrible platform that is made specifically for profiting regardless of what takes place here including bullying harassment cyber stocking censoring of fact and a lack of intellectual right you dont on your photos or any of your content you can be a victim of identity theft and hacking hijacking of your account the accounts are insecure anyoneCan access your account from anywhere in the world without being held responsible for your own sake stay off Instagram delete it and dont use it you can do many good things with your time besides wasting it on Instagram
"Absolute worst customer service on the planet. Instagram does not care about the average people that use this app. My Instagram account was hacked and the hacker changed my username, password, phone number, and email associated with my account. Ive tried numerous ways to get my account back from the hacker. Ive reported the account for impersonating me and Ive reported the spam Instagram posts they have been posting with absolutely no luck. Now, the hacker has blocked me from even seeing the account. Ive tried getting my account back with the video selfie verification process numerous times. EVERY TIME I have tried to upload the video selfies, it shows me an error message and the videos arent sent to Instagram. So basically i cant get into my account/cant get it back from the hacker. I have absolutely HAD IT. It has been a week since the hacker took my account. Who knows if theyve downloaded my data or not. This is a serious privacy concern and it looks like Instagram does not care because Ive seen multiple articles and threads online explaining this problem and Instagram STILL does not have a solution. Ive had my account for 10 years and I guess this is the thanks I get for being a loyal user for a decade. BTW Instagram DOES NOT HAVE a customer service number or email so you cant even fix this problem with anyone from Instagram. You are practically on your own. It seems like celebrities are able to get their accounts back from hackers, but not us average, working class people. Long story short, Instagram does not care about its users. They only care about the famous ones. My message to Instagram is to make the video selfie verification WORK ON THE APP. You are all putting peoples privacy on the line"
Social Society. The app itself life changing minus being flagged for false allegations and deleted for tracking underage drug dealers soliciting to my younger siblings as well human trafficking its ok
Love the app. Love the app but not the security seems I was hacked very easily got rid of Facebook because of hackers now my Instagram is hacked to
Posting is so easy. I love how accessible everything is in this app Great way to share with friends. The private accounts are really safe. None of your info is shared. 5 stars follow me @char.patt.531
Thank you. If it had not been for Instagram link to our Facebook page. We would not have been able to reach our Facebook page. To let love ones know we could not get into our account. Because Facebook refuses to allow us access to our accounts. They are not sending out codes. We recommend everyone use Instagram instead of Facebook
They are censoring truth. Smashing our rights by censoring truth is what this app is all about now. NOT OKAY  This app is now able to take your personal pictures and do God know what with them. NOT OK
Privacy Concern. What to do with ads?
"Yes, they are exploiting you. I pulled my account from Insta when Facebook bought it, because: I thought I could have privacy. Haha No. But no matter, the community on IG is better than on any other platform. And the ads are superior, too. Your privacy is already compromised. Enjoy this platform"
". Ever since they sold out to Facebook, Instagram has gone down hill. Too much spam and they never respond to a reported issue"
Used to be better. This app used to be much better. Used to be fun. But since it was acquired by facebook. Like everything they touch it when down hill. And now its just a tracking app with tons of advertisements for sales
"shamefull. This app is condemned for supporting Trump's assassination, and violating my privacy. The policies of the US government should not violate the right of citizens of other countries to freedom of expression and protest against US government assassination. Instagram should apologize to Trump for deleting my protest posts. Instagram has even deleted my critical post about itself. it's shamefull"
"Bad for humanity. By Instagrams own internal research, the app has been shown to negatively impact the mental health of all users, but especially teens and kids. Instead of addressing the issue, Instagram choses to pursue profit; leveraging their research and data collection to keep people on the app longer and serve them as many ads as possible. This app is morally bankrupt. It died the day it was bought by Facebook"
Love the app but Instagram doesnt care about helping users to be better. I have been using this app for almost 10 years and happy to see how much it has progressed and now is a way of life. With that being said I have transitioned from using IG for personal use to now business. Using Instagram for ur business is a great challenge and theres NO ONE available to help to answer any app questions you may have for your BUSINESS. This is extremely frustrating because it to me shows Instagram actually doesnt care about its customers but is more concerned with users and numbers. I cannot record over 15 seconds on my ig story and I have been writing messages in the help section since Spring 19 and its now Winter 2020 and not a single response for me to work my program correctly for my business. Personal use IG is great but for a platform to market a business and usage they are lacking. Pull your patience out you pocket when dealing with this app just because they really dont care what your doing with it as long as you use it and FB makes their little money :) THANKS INSTAGRAM
"Community guidelines. Im a Jewish girl and I must say my life has changed since I downloaded Instagram I never knew how much hate there is in the world against Jews I feel very attacked and have a lot of stress I take it personal The worst part is, whenever I see hate posts or videos or comments and I report them they almost never get removed Instagram is definitely not seeing all reported post or they support Jew hatred Im very hurt and @instagram is not doing their job"
Worst social media app. Instagram is always broken for me not letting me change my name or my bio to flat out not functioning its constantly glitching or even logging me out every ten minutes now it doesnt even refresh anything and I get notifications but cant see my messages and things are sending forever even in WiFi and with data everything else works besides insta gram that wont refresh or show anything new anymore
"Privacy & Safety. This app is so disturbing, its disgusting. There are rampant bots that are just sharing peoples private photos and they are all by the same people. Just IP ban them already, I already have a ton of their names especially one in particular thats just being weird and harassing me and my family. We are tired of it. Please, send me a message on Twitter @Spartan_Bow_121"
5 starts. I give it 5 stars because it is safe for kids in many ways: 1. you can make your account private allowing access only to people you know 2. It wont show you anything inappropriate unless people you follow have that content 3. Can turn off tracking
"Instagram music and fonts. I have two accounts for my Instagram. Business and personal. My personal account has access to all the new fonts, features and music on stories.My business account does not. I have tried many things to rectify this but its not working. Please fix this"
Direct messages going to Facebook. I never allowed Instagram direct messages to be connected to Facebook. Or notifications. I dont want it. It creates a spam
A must have app. This is my 11th year using Instagram. We have had our ups and downs  but IG is one of the most consistent things in my life. From my personal life to my professional life I have always thoroughly enjoyed using Instagram to connect with other across the world as well as locally. Thank you Instagram
Instagram is excellent and professional. Using Instagram for business and personal use is very helpful and reliable; That is you are able meet new people who can even help or are willing to engage in a business with you
Story Views Error. They took who views your story &amp; I DO NOT LIKE THAT. This is a PRIVACY ISSUE I should be allowed who is watching me to then have THE ABILITY TO BLOCK WHO I WANT FROM WATCHING ME  I DO NOT LIKE KNOWING WHO IS WATCHING MY STORY I SHOULD HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER MY INSTAGRAM
"privacy problems and glitches. when i unrestricted someone every time i go to send them a post i have to search up theyre name because it wont go back to the top of the list even after talking for a while, also a good add is when you comment if you long hold your own comment you can copy. i was falsely accused of using a follower buying couldnt get into my account had to delete the app cuz thats the only way i could get my account back, had a ban from commenting and liking for about a week and now my instagram glitches from audio, to video, algorithm, following, and today where im supposed to get my account back fully i havent. bad"
"Sort out the scammers. I love what Instagram is supposed to be about but they absolutely need to sort out the endless scam profiles. I have gone from having an open account and being able to share my photos which I loved to having to make it close and decline and report and block a torrent of Bitcoin scammers and romance scammers. Instagram does nothing to stop this and indeed encourages. In the unnecessary suggested for you nonsense they actually suggest newly created obviously insincere profiles with no photos. How dare you. If I didnt love my personal account and snapshots from my life and places I have been, I would delete my account and finish with Insta in the same way more and more people do with other Meta platforms. Such a shame"
"Bad Privacy Policy. Weak opsec, bad third party policy"
"Stalkers. I used to love using Instagram. However, since Facebook -AKA creeping, spying advert pushing greed freaks took over, its just become another advertising enterprise.They show me specific adverts related to recent google searches Ive done. And now I see adverts in shop images related to specific items in my eBay basket. This clearly indicates spying, I do not agree with this. So bye bye Instagram app"
"Better Privacy. I keep getting random message request from scams , spams and people I dont know sending me inappropriate messages and sales. And its getting annoying"
Love it. Love using instagram and would love more information on limits
Its okay. Just one suggestion. In my opinion it is a good app all except for that I just have a personal account and it would probably be greatly appreciated by tons of people if you could make an update that allows us to see who viewed our accounts. And who viewed our posts. I know you can see who viewed your stories but I mean posts and profile. That would be very nice if that would be possible
Horrible. This is a horrible platform that is made specifically for profiting regardless of what takes place here including bullying harassment cyber stocking censoring of facts and a lack of intellectual rights you dont own your photos or any of your content you can be a victim of identity theft and hacking hijacking of your account the accounts are insecure anyoneCan access your account from anywhere in the world without being held responsible for your own sake stay off Instagram delete it and dont use it you can do many good things with your time besides wasting it on Instagram
Hate the new update. I hate that they added the new shoptab at the bottom where the heart used to be and you could see who liked or followed you. As if constant unwanted adds werent enough now theyve added a whole shop tab. Also I want to see what my friends post not some suggested posts on my timeline otherwise what is the point . Also they have removed recent hashtags which makes it hard for me and other creatives to get our work discovered. I get why they did it but the election is over now so they should bring it back. Theres a lot of problems on this app Im considering just deleting it and using just behanced for my professional stuff. As far as for my personal I guess Ill have to find a different social media app that actually lets me catch up and see what my friends are doing. Ya know a social media app thats actually social 
"Instagram has passed its prime. Not a good way to get followers, wont let me upload things out of my photos folder. Plus the Zucc owns it now so you know your data is building the ManaNode. plus I feel like we are over the my life is perfect, look at these filters and my perfection... like people arent very active"
They asked for all my information. My sister always on dis app so I said to myself I am I trying out do you all my information in a minute I wasnt comfortable with it so I said how do you do that she said Im not I dont know I dont know come for you you didnt tell me a put me some like what not and I dont feel comfortable with it Sonia said no Im Nam will give you all my information who will give your information to someone you dont know I just literally freaked me out say asleepI was so mad at her I deleted the game for whatever Im not playing in the more so always remember they kept my phone Im sleeping shes going to take my phone I want my information back with them OK this is my reviews
Instagram is the best. I like the privacy :) nobody can see my account
"the app is amazing but a lot of features should be added. I LOVE THIS APP. I have like 3 personal accounts and 2 other business/school accounts that I run as well. I think this app is amazing for all ages. Although, I wish it had a feature to tell me who does not follow me back. I also wished they had a feature on who has not been active in my followers. For example, instagram could have a page listing who has not viewed my story or liked my post the past months/weeks. This is a good feature because other fellow instagramers and I will not have to download insights apps who steal our information and hack our accounts. Please insta if you are reading this please add these features. Im sure you will get more people downloading the app"
Why do you limit my page?. I work in Instagram and Im a really personal but you limited my page why?
This is no longer a peer to peer social media app. Since zuck bucks bought this I noticed I see less of the people I follow on my feed and more sponsored and suggested post based on their ad aggressive algorithm. Will delete and wait for a new platform that isnt tainted by shady data-mining practices
"Invading my privacy. The product my roommate is interested in has been constantly promoted on my end, which is so sick and disgusting. The app is so evil"
"Account got disabled for no reason. Apparently Zuckerberg has decided to force everyone to submit video selfies by treating every REAL user as fake. Just as you thought Facebooks privacy policies couldnt be any worse, theyre now collecting facial recognition data with no other means to get back into your account. What a shame"
"Accounts are to easy to be hacked and used for scams. Instagram is certainly a great app for chatting with friends and sharing special moments with them, its also easy to use but the worst thing is that the security is horrible and the support they have basically doesnt even exist, accounts are hacked so often and used for frauds and scams but yet nothing is done about it, its also very easy to steal and get personal info directly from the app, if your planning on getting a social media app I much rather recommended Snapchat over this as its harder to hack accounts and you can still chat/talk and share special moments with friends and family fairly easily, it also has WAY better video and regular calls"
"Why did yall do this. So the first issue is obviously the newest update, which has made it clear to the users of Instagram that they want the most amount of profit from us by making a whole section dedicated to shopping where notifs used to be. Girl what is that? Thats never been the point of Instagram. Second and on a more personal note, Instagram has the absolute WORST help center. Instagram (through Facebook) offers no live chat, no help email, no call center to aid in complicated issues. I had attempted to solve an issue of being locked out of Instagram after an issue with being hacked. They sent me an email to send a picture of myself with a code, which I happily sent them, and I have yet to get a reply. No lie, its been months. Coming up on 5 months now. Please figure out a better system"
Review on instagram. My account information has been hacked and Instagram have been useless in helping me get my account back
Instagram review. Instagram is bad. They ban all good accounts and have little to no freedom or privacy
"Going downhill fast. Ive been a loyal Instagram user since April 2012 and Im not sure Ive ever seen an app fall apart as quickly as Instagram is. Its so obvious the app is no longer meant for connecting with people you follow, its meant to have their algorithm sell you things. I understand thats monetization and it was inevitable but they arent even trying to hide what theyre doing. Youre now fed suggested posts and theres no way to turn it off. Want to see a chronological feed of friends posts? Nah, sorry bud, cant do that. Enjoy 50 pictures of oversaturated forests because you liked a hiking picture onceAs terrible as that change was, moving the search away to get you to watch reels and now moving notifications away to sell you merchandise? Horrible. Instagram is completely unrecognizable and has lost the plot. This isnt a platform for photos anymore and honestly if I didnt use it for messaging friends Id delete this app entirely"
Unnecessarily invasive. This app is too unnecessarily intrusive. It requires camera and microphone access even if I only want to post a picture or video that is already in my photo library.Not only that but I seem to have turned those permissions on and off so many times that not instragam is refusing to even load anything. I cant see my friends stories or posts on my phone
"Wth Instagram?. My accounts that I use most for business and personal are routinely having issues Most recent, I get the try again later we restrict certain activity message what activity? Nothing inappropriate is ever posted, no bad language this is getting really really annoying Instagram is actually making it harder to make money and we pay for advertising. "
"Privacy settings are a joke. Thanks Instagram for your garbage privacy settings that dont work Whats the point in turning off tagging ability if youre just going to still notify me. Lets also just let trolls post wantonly about where someone lives, take your sweet time to review posts and still do nothing. If I could give zero stars I would"
"Instagram, amazing app. In the great world of social media this app is great to use because there is lots of different reasons it can be used for, for personal things or for business or something else. I love this app its my favourite social medial"
. I do not like this application because it does not give privacy to people.I also consider this app a spy machine for criminal Americal hate Instagram
"This new update is horrible. When I want to see my notifications I have to always go to the main page and click the heart to see the notifications and its hard because I get confused on which thing to click to see my notifications( I know I have to get used to the new update but I cant I want the old instagram back who the frick does this when their app is growing but then suddenly they destroy their app by putting a stupid update I feel like Im about to explode because of this new update and to tell you there is so much problem in instagram)which is why I hate this new update but the other reason why I hate this new update is because the story I post (for example I post my story and I want to put it in my highlights but I cant because it wont let me).Another problem is why would you want us to connect with Facebook when we never asked for it you think that we want our story to end up being in Facebook story (people wants privacy  I want my friends to see my story in instagram not my family to see my instagram post in Facebook story)I like instagram but I want my old instagram back and if you guys cant do that then whats the point of even using this  every likes instagram [not everyone] and wants to use instagram forever but why would you suddenly ruin itSo once I posted a story in my close friends and this one person ended up seeing my post when I never added this person in my close friends and I dont even know her and she ended up seeing my post [ I thought mhm how did she ended up seeing my post because I know that it is impossible for a person who is not on my close friends list to see a post, so I checked my close friends and I didnt see her name I got freaked out so o texted her and asked her how she saw my close friends post and she told I dont know maybe a glitch] and to keep in mind this was about 4-5 months ago.instaaaaagrammm what is your problem dude let us live For instagram: Why wont you ban people that post scary stuff  example: gore,killing people,ghost,chopping,dark,alone ETC. (This is mostly like the people that pretends to be a kpop fan but is not a kpop fan and its actually a person who kills people by texting that person and asking questions and like I heard someone say they will find your address if you answer them  their post may look like a normal post like but it is actually not a fancam - in the end of the video there is a scary jump scare like a person killing them selves( their bio always says what are you afraid of or what scares you and has a odd symbol thing. I know this isnt a problem but it actually is I hope you guys do what we want because no one will like this app anymore if you dont unupdate instagramI hope you guys leave a 1 star and make the creator to unupdate this new update so that we all could enjoy instagram again  oh and lets be friends in instagram so we could talk about instagram my username in instagram is Srai.maya if you cant find my name use this username then Salinarai_mulang"
"Do we REALLY need this app?. Its safe to say this app has gone completely down hill from where its started. It was just posting your pictures and maybe some video clips and people commenting and sending messages to now they turned it into a whole mess thats horrible. It feels more like a pushy galleria of cheap garage sells more and more when you log on. And because of the pandemic trying to report something thats problematic falls on deaf ears (not that they were doing much about it before) MZ is just a problem in general and needs to turn this platform over to someone else to run. Hes doing a horrible job with this. More so, why does IG need to have the ability to see our call logs, our sms records and listen into our mics and our cameras?go ahead and look at the new TOS and see what I mean. This isnt normal. Hes doing what tiktoc is doing with our privacy. He needs to grow up"
"Review. My favorite social media I use it all the time, best way for personal growth"
"I NEED HELP WITH MULTIPLE ISSUES & IG has no way for me to contact them. So issue 1: I have a personal IG and a blog IG. Both have insights/analytics I can access bc theyre business accounts. However, my analytics page on my blog IG settings looked normal (3 tabs, you could see content, activity, and audience). But the analytics on my personal IG were only one page. And they werent helpful. It basically only showed me analytics for one post at a time. I figured, i wanted my personal IG (which is a business account just like my blog IG) to show analytics in the tab-way of the blog. Because my personal IG actually did used to show my analytics the same way as the blog but for some reason that changed not too long ago and i hated it. I figured it was a glitch with instagram so i decided to log out and log back in.I can now log back in on my blog IG, but my instagram wont even let my personal IG log in. i press the log in button and it just doesnt do anything. not even an error message appears. I tried deleting the IG app and redownloading and that did not help either. I want my normal analytics back on my personal IG business account and I want to be able to LOG IN. Please help"
"Too much censorship, ruined app. This used to be my favorite app. All the information gathering, censorship and fact-checking has ruined it. This is not my first go to app anymore. Not my second third or fourth either. If you want your privacy completely obliterated, this apps for you"
"Unusable because of the number of ads. The number of ads in the app makes it hard to enjoy. There are ads in reels, ads in your post feed, and most annoyingly, ads after every single friends story. It goes story, ad, story, double ad, story, double ad with multiple pages. If youre lucky, you wont notice, but if you just want to see what youre friends are up to, this is not the app for you. Just call or text your friends and save your privacy and prevent yourself from the subliminal damage of too much exposure to advertisements"
Steal your information. If you want your information stolen and sold this app is for you
too many ads and they take too much data. every 2 posts a a fkn sponsored post and they update their app way too much just to make u say yes to them stealing your data. also the algorithm sucks and fables famous people
"Dont trust this app anymore. Please be careful when you decide to get Instagram. Lots of strangers follow you without your permission and I had porn bots DM me several times and I reported them as spam but IG never listens. At least on Facebook or Snapchat, you have to friend request the other person in order for them to follow u, not here, on here if youd have to make your account private if you dont want people to follow you"
Security is BULLSHT. there is NO real security on this app. once ur account is gone there is nothing u can do. they changed my email and phone number bc for some reason instagram would allow me to even verify them. The people on my account are literally replying to messages and attmepting to sell bitcoin through my account (ive never tried to buy bitcoin or even interacted with an account selling it.) And there isnt a single real person you can contact for help. they send you to a website that isnt helpful at all
Bring back the old ig. Instagram became too nosey not enough privacy... they know what you post nd deletes it
Need improvements. Need individual privacy settings for posts
"Invasion of privacy. Go to he** for spying on us. Your app is so obviously listening to me and my conversations. Getting ads for things after I talk about them with someone. Not sure how youre getting away with it. Deleted the app from my phone, I know thousands of not millions of people who will start to do the same. I know many people personally who are leaving your platform. Goodbye and good riddance"
"The Final Straw. As of December 20, 2020, I am completely disappointed in what Instagram has become. The quality of life on the app has declined significantly over the years. I feel my privacy among other things is being compromised with new terms of service. I don&#39;t feel comfortable continuing to use the app. You have squeezed the life out of what was one of the best platforms for sharing content. As a content creator, I will be looking for a new platform to move to. The app has way too much bloat attached to it and has become Facebook mini"
Its not working. I tried to download my Instagram data and it wont let me to download it
"Messages. Ever since the update yesterday, I have to keep deleting and re-downloading instagram to be able to access my messages or even just use my account, its gotten to the point that I cant even log out and log back in, I just have to delete the app and re-download it"
Leaving Instagram. With every update Instagram gets worse and worse. It supplies no foundation for growth and just is an endless hole of ads. Sorry but bye. Its the lack of privacy for me
Logged me out for suspicious activity. Nah Instagram is trash. They locked my account for suspicious activity ? Like WHATT I put in all my info and codes that was sent to my number so I can get back in a they DEMAND a number from my previous phone  I changed my number so I dont have access to it. Buts not the number in my account so why do you need the code from it. This new update has been bogus yall need to fix this ASAP
"Hiding the truth. Instagram are blocking and deleting every page or personal account thats spreading awareness about whats happening in Palestine, it shows how its deeply run by Jews and inhuman people, shame on you Instagram you failed your humanity test"
". Hi there I just got Instagram a week ago and l will have to say, it is a great way to connect with my friends, see what they are up to and a great source for school clubs and events.However.l have heard news that Instagram is becoming a social media video sharing app instead of focused on the photo aspect.This is highlydisappointing because we already have so many different apps that are MEANT for videos. A lot of my friends are artists and photographers who make money through Instagram.This is where they are most likely to switch over to another platform.Icompletelv understand whv thev are doing this, but that is iust gonna tear the app apart.I would like the people of Instagram to reconsider this update that is up and coming soon. Or even ohh right nowwho knows. lf you want to add more video features,go ahead,but please don't throw artists,business andphotographers down the drain like that.Make sure to qive both parties the right amount of attentionBesides thatlabsolutely adore Instagram and how much security privacy it goes for private accounts such as my own.Either way,l really hope you see this Instagram and reply. I know a lot people who areconsidering leaving the app cause of this new update.Thank you so much for your timeToday"
"Ignores privacy settings. Even when I turn off the apps access to my microphone, the app still gives me advertisements based on conversations Ive had and NOT my browser history. I know that they are tailored because they are VERY specific and not subjects Ive looked up with my browser"
Love Instagram. It&#39;s easy to use and much more personal then Facebookcoi
"Frustrated, Annoyed, and Not Enjoyable Anymore. I have had Instagram for years and I have been with it through all its changes. Though there has been many great things that have come through the various updates and improvements I have to say that this app is going downhill.  Firstly, the ads. I am completely okay with ads, but I have noticed every third post on my explore page and home feed is an ad. Its extremely frustrating and makes the app hard to scroll through for a long time. This could be improved by making it every 6-8th post. Minor change but would make a major difference.  Secondly, I need to mention a request that has been desired by Instagram users for ages: chronological order of posts. The algorithm is extremely frustrating and does not show the posts I actually want to see. I find that I rarely see some of my friends pages even after scrolling through my feed for awhile. No, making posts chronological will not make my feed messy. If the argument is that it would make it messy, perhaps you could put the posts that would have appeared on the explore page from the algorithm onto some slots on the explore page, much like YouTube does (we get posts on our explore page from people we already subscribe to essentially)  And most recently, I have been most disappointed by the newest update which replaces the notification tab with the shop tab and the post tab with the reels tab. This makes no sense. I have not counted a single time where I have gone to the reels tab or shop tab and actually used their functions  I just dont find them enjoyable or purposeful on an app to share pictures with friends. I also find this absurd because the tabs on the bottom of the screen are typically the ones used most commonly, which I can say I do check my notifications tab very often. Putting it at the top of the screen in an awkward spot is confusing, weird, and senseless. Not to mention that the tab to post is now also in a harder to access part of the screen (specifically talking about app design and thumb range, a minor inconvenience but an overall design flaw). On an app meant to post photos, it would make the most sense to put the main component, the post tab, right at the center of the tabs at the bottom, like how it used to be. The new layout is poorly designed and makes no sense.  I find myself going on Instagram less and less now, I dont find it as enjoyable anymore for the reasons above. I truly wish the developers would actually listen to criticism instead of making the app harder to use for its consumers and even more packed with ways to sell things and shove in ads where ever possible. I honestly would not be surprised if they started putting ads in the direct messages (please dont get any ideas).  Developers, although you may never see my review, I hope you take it to heart if you do see it. Us users want change We are telling you exactly the features that would vastly improve this app  its time you listen"
Instagram. Please get rid of the shop tab. Keep that to Facebook. I downloaded this app for photos and people. Not shopping
"Tracking my thoughts. Why is it that when I even think about a product &amp; I dont search for it or anything, I see advertising for that product on Instagram within a couple of hours of having that thought? Also its really hard to grow a business using its algorithm"
"Insta for years. Ive been on Instagram for years. Recently I got on to find out my account was disabled? No reason given. It told me to prove it was my account. I filled out what it told me and it said they would review my info and if verified, I could request a review in the help center in 24 hours. Its been more than a week and I get the same message. I cannot get any help. Why Instagram? Why is this allowed to happen? I havent posted anything that should be an issue. My account is private as well no one has access other than my followers"
"MAKE THE SWITCH TO VERO. Make sure this company loses so much profit and dont listen to their apologies as well since its all lies so then they can keep you on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.Make their stock market crash, make them go out of business just like how you once did with MySpace and the other social media platforms from the past. Facebook founder doesnt like you, he just wants to keep your personal data, spread hate speech, misinformation about the vaccines and other things as well.Take action and delete your Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and anything owned by Facebook and download the app Vero. Vero isnt owned by Facebook so you dont need to worry about false information or things that misleads the public"
"Notification and Sharing a post. Now I dont receive any messages or notification on instagram and if I want to post a pic and link it to my facebook it doesnt post on facebook only on instagram it needs to be repaired this app.And recently today september 12,2020 I just randomly got into my account and had to log back in and send a security code with my text message idk why probably it said someone hacked or reported my account idk why but it sound pretty stupid if someone did and receiving dumb messages that people want request idk but they need to fix it please"
Instagram doesnt care about its hacked users. Its sad that so many of us use this platform to connect and share family moments with family and friends and yet when someone hacks a personal account there is little to no response. Links for support are not where they say they are. Hackers are stilling my 10 month olds pictures to use for their cash app scam and Instagram cant even respond to help me get my account back or take it down when reported This is so frustrating. Get your support team together. Multimillion dollar platform and cant even stop obvious spam and hackers from posting but can flag minuscule offensive things
"Privacy nightmare. As good at this app might be, they constantly spy on you.  AVOID"
"instagram on mobile is . i love this app a lot it is so fun, i have been using instagram on a computer since like march 2020 up until 3rd march which was my birthday & my new phone, and i have always found it difficult to do normal things that every mobile user can do and on the web version it is very limited compared to a phone if u ask me  anyways now that i have got my very first iPhone i have loved using instagram on it, it is incredible fun and the opportunities are endless and tbh a bit addicting not going to lie, overall my favourite social media of all time hands down "
"New updates. Instagram has been going downhill consistently over the past 3 years. They got rid of chronological order in your timeline, theyve made it harder for personal accounts to be seen so you basically have to make a separate account to follow your family if you actually want to see their content. With this new update the Time line auto refreshes and the odds of even seeing the post you were looking at is next to non existent since it might be from a month ago on that persons feed, but dont worry youll see 10 sponsored posts and ads as you scroll. If you plan on communicating through Direct Messages, just forget it You might as well delete the entire app"
"Every update is a disaster. Now they&#39;re grouping &#34;likes&#34; so you can&#39;t even see who&#39;s liking what. They took away the ability to see what people we follow like, so now we&#39;re practically on a platform that&#39;s a personal photo album. Engagement is hella down and there&#39;s a crap load of ads. So over it"
"Steals info. It steals your information, its not worth it. I would rate it a 0 if I could. Please dont get if you dont want them to get your face. Good luck if you get it"
"Business page. I love Ig... I just wish it would transfer all my posts to FB not just single photo OR video posts... Every time I post a combination of videos &amp; photos, it does not transfer over to my FB page. I also wish Business pages could have the music voiceover on stories, just like personal pages"
Instagram Data wont turn on. I have a problem because I have done everything I can beside uninstalling the app and it still wont work. I am going to be uninstalling right now and reinstalling but if that doesnt work then I dont see how I can ever use instagram again because if the data wont turn on it obviously wont load the app at all. Any information that could help would be great
"Instagram account hacked. My account was hacked, and I have reached out with so many emails to the support help team, who has not responded at all.Basically someone have access to my account, they changed my email and number to theirs so I cant reset the password or do anything. And I have emailed so many times to Instagram as this person have been messaging my friends and family about this investment opportunities.None of the questions or guide given on the website is helpful, because the application doesnt not have any of those steps Worst experience of my life with such a social media platform"
"Pls let Instagram be instagram. I love using Instagram for photos later for storiesand I share my understanding of relating the like button and put a shop tab in the main navigation, but the latest update for instagram reel, I always accidentally hit the middle tab because of the old grammar of operation of this app... and I live in a place where cellular data is very expensive...and video costs so much more data"
"Instagram is not protective of its users. Recently my Instagram account was hacked by someone who managed to send me a text with a link from the Instagram number, which allowed him to change the password and the phone number associated with the account to his own. This made it so I could not access the account at all. I received no text or email telling me that the account phone number had been changed, nor was I able to change the password once I received a notification that someone had logged into my account. I spent countless hours troubleshooting and navigating through the help page, all to no avail. I couldnt even get access to a support request form. I have tried everything. I have read every article from people who have experienced the same exact thing. I have filled out every form I can find. I have reported the account many times in an attempt to just get it shut down, even though it will probably take weeks before the reports even get noticed. I tried to contact Instagram but nobody answers the phone, and the help email is not even in use anymore. Navigating through the help page is a nightmare and has not been helpful at all. The hacker is now threatening to release my personal information in exchange for ransom money. It is ridiculous that Instagram offers basically no support and is impossible to reach. It is ridiculous that Instagram is not even safe enough to protect users accounts from hacking in the first place. My personal safety is on the line. This is an extremely time sensitive issue, yet Instagram is in no way timely when it comes to addressing issues like these. I am hoping that this review will somehow grab the attention of someone who works for Instagram. I am shocked that a company the of this size and user network does not offer over the phone assistance. Please do better to protect the safety and privacy of Instagram users"
"Say goodbye to privacy. New terms of service are disgusting. They can not only jut access your calls, texts, photos, but they can literally record you. What has this world come to"
Hacked. So my Instagram got hacked and I have no way to get in contact with you guys I have all the information and all the information about the person who hacked my account that changed my email my phone my password and I got pictures on there that I will lose that I can never get back so if somebody can get in contact with me about this that be lovely
"Horrible. Idk where to start. It limits how much you can do things. So if youre someone who comments, messages, likes(who know the whole point of the app) they will block you from doing it if you do it too much in a day. I have a personal and business account and they are completely different versions of the app. Sometimes Ill like a picture and itll just erase the like. It doesnt let people repost my stories(yes I have my settings set to allow that) I have people trying to support my small business during these tough times and they cant even repost my stories. Just horrible"
"Need more security against scammers. There are a LOT of scam accounts that target people on Instagram. When reporting an account the only options are for people pretending to be accounts or celebrities that they are not, or people posting spam. I feel that Instagram should put more effort into protecting against scammers who send people messages promising money and iPhones in exchange for seemingly harmless data. People ignorant of these types of scammers fall victim to them all the time, and it is a bad look for a platform when there is virtually no punishment for scammers. Very upsetting to see friends and family getting hacked because of these bottom feeders who have no right to be on a platform made for creators, and for friends and family to stay connected. I feel it is a joint responsibility from the users and the social media app itself to weed out the scam accounts that plague the platform. How is a 13 year old going to know that someone asking for their name and email is after their sensitive information?"
Need to fix it to where people can regain their accounts. My account got hacked and Instagram had the POOREST solutions. You guys need to figure out a way for our followers to report our page as hacked or up your customer service responses because this is sad. Yall have these hackers doing inappropriate violating things on our personal accounts we no longer have access to
Pictures and uploads. I like uploading photos of my self and posting. I also admire looking at other photos and checking other personal profiles
"Gross. Enemy of free speech and society alike. Not to mention literally ripping you off your your personal and sensitive information which Facebook profits off while all you receive in return is a warped view of reality. Wake up, and run"
hi. private all off information from my account
sharing of posts with close friends. Just like the privacy in story with close friends instagram should definitely have the same feature with posts
Update is absolutely ridiculous. How does a photo sharing app prioritize shopping over notifications? Makes you wonder where their priorities are at
its alright. use to love it and can love it more but instagram takes away followers and dont add the same features for all to use. i STILL have yet to be able to use the animated text or closed caption features when they created them. its like theyre controlling who gets what and want to keep certain people from prospering. wayyyy better before mark the data collector took over
Enough is enough. Stop the censorship and unethical use of users private data
Please. Instagram please dont allow strangers DM us please dont allow it if its friends then ok if not why they have right to send you massages please stop this and make it a good privacy
"I dont feel safe using this app. I dont feel safe sharing my info to this app for fear of it being shared/loss of privacy, such as my phone number, birthday, etc. However, I use the app for the sole purpose of being in contact with family and friends. If there is anyway to guarantee the safety of information and privacy that would be great and very much appreciated Thank you Other than that the app is great"
"Please add privacy settings for single posts. Ive been waiting and waiting for the option to change your privacy settings for a single post(s). Yes, I know you can make your profile public vs. private. And yes I also know there is the close friends option for stories. Im looking for more than black or white though for posts. There shouldve and should also be a feature to selectively change the privacy for a single post. Facebook has this option for posts and its great because there are some friends/family/coworkers I dont want to delete as a friend/follower but I might have a post here or there that I would not want to see (said posts could be that one with your significant other that might seem too racy for a family member, or you could have a political post that could make you look bad to a friend/family member who disagrees with you, or you could just have that photo that says Im a human having fun...but then its viewed as unprofessional by a coworker/someone that youre friends with that crosses the lines on sharing ALL your pictures with them)"
"Tracking. You get your account disabled if they are not aloud to track you. Some other dude wrote this, I had the same issue though. This is the worst app and I hopesomething similar to Instagram comesout instead. They disabled my accounthave been disabling peoples accountsleft and right mistakenly or claiming thatwe've violated their terms They won'ttell you exactly what you did wrong.They'll just log you out and if you do getit reactivated all they do is just say sorryfor the inconvenience. Like WHAT. Dobetter Instagram. You're targeting thewrong people. There's so much nudity onthis app that doesn't get taken down.There's SO MANY FAKE ACCOUNTS onthis app Y'all are worrying and disablingthe wrong accounts. Horrible app.Doesn't let you appeal. I've been disablefor almost a month now and have contactInstagram daily through sending formsbecause ANOTHER THING You can't talkto a REAL PERSON EVER How horrible isthat This app is the worst. Thank God forTik Tok replacing Instagram. I do lovesharing photos but hopefully a betterapp comes out. I've lost all hope withInstagram. My account is still disabledand I even made a new one Praying toget my old one back and now the app issaying my account is suspicious and thatthey'll disabled me if I don't confirmmyself in the next 30 days. This app"
"Stop spying on me. I have my app tracking option disabled. Additionally, the camera and microphone are turned off on the app. Still somehow, when I try to shop for something elsewhere online, I see ads for it immediately afterwards on Instagram. I dont like it and I want it to stop"
Custom posts. I think its time make possible to get some privacy instagram give us option that we can hide some posts from certain people
"This app acts like an over controlling parent. I would post a picture if I could, but sadly I cannot. The new Instagram updates piss me off. Today, I couldnt access my Direct messages (DMs) because  Try again later. we limit how often you can do certain things on instagram to protect our community. Tell us if you think we made a mistake. I clicked on the tell us button and it keeps lagging so I cant press on it. I know for a fact it is definitely not a phone problem because I got this phone a few weeks ago, brand new from the apple store. Instagram, do better. It used to be my favorite app"
Horrible. I had gotten a message that instagram had been tracking me and selling my info. Do not download unless youre willing to have your info get sold
"Likes count is what makes Instagram fun. So, if Instagram is taking off the likes counter, Im taking off 2 stars away from the app experience. As petty or vain as that sounds, the likes counter is a metric I like to use to gauge content performance. Its part of what makes making content fun and worth it. I used Instagram for business before and it really helps gauge what type of content works for the user base and provides feedback just like this app rating system on the App Store. Tiktok is slowly taking over the social media industry and instead of innovating, youre removing the metrics and motivators that work or copy what other apps are doing. Slowly, youll become like Facebook and lose market share to other new social media apps. Sorry Instagram, but Im really considering deleting my app especially with all of the issues surrounding our privacy. Removing the likes might be the last nail to the coffin so tread carefully"
Account Review. Instagram is great and all but these days I am getting spam messages from friends and i am anonymous about sending these. I dont know if its like a promotion but pls fix this or else thousands of peoples phone be hacked. Other than that i recommend that Instagram is a great place for news and other things
"Many problems with access. Instagram is a good app over all but when it comes to its detection of Boths or hackers its horrible.I started unfollowing accounts because I followed to many and it kicked me out of my insta because it thought my account was hacked.I made a new account but now I dont have the access to like,comment or reply to post.I hope the app can fix this so I and many others can enjoy the app fully"
Problems of security. Instagram is a great app but this day the security is bad my account have been hacked twice in a month and I Havent do anything I havent share any of my information and still got hacked
Privacy. I think its time where you guys update the privacy setting. Even though I block a person from seeing my story I also would like to be able to block them from seeing certain posts when I post onto my page rather than into my story. I think that would be a great feature to have on the app
"Customer service - security. I love Insta and all that it offers but while business and personal accounts are being hacked daily, theres absolutely NOBODY to reach for help and reporting is proving to be lost in thin air Small businesses are being destroyed by idiot hackersas if covid and lockdowns werent enough damageA better security customer service would go a long way"
"Not About YOU anymore. I finally deactivated all my accounts and got rid of this app.After it added the unnecessary shop button and updates, it started to lose its quality.I barely see people I follow anymore, because my feed is full of ads and suggested posts.I want to see posts from people I follow. Not what Instagram wants me to see.If I wanted to see suggested posts, Id go to the discover page.But now theyre shoving ads and ways to profit off you, down your throat. It has stopped being an app for expressing your life and self.Its known for causing mental health problems.And Im tired of all the effort and time I put into it with marketing my business and managing my personal account.Remove the ads, suggested posts, and shop button nobody cares about.They only care about money at this point.Its been months without this app and its made my mental health significantly better"
"Just another gov app. Just another app the government uses to spy on us. No music half the time, they keep changing everything thats good"
"Hacked. When your account gets hacked, theres absolutely no way of deleting or getting your account back and Instagram help doesnt even help you. They change your log ins and email and phone number associated with your account & youre just hacked forever. Idk why Instagram does this and doesnt help you but now my accounts hacked and theyre posting stuff and promoting money scams & theres absolutely nothing I can do"
"UGHHH. I see WAYYYY too many ads i literally see an ad every 3 posts and its so annoying i hate instagram now theres literally no use cause all you see are ads now, they make money off selling your personal information and then they make money off of ads... you can tell this company doesnt care about you or your privacy on the internet AT ALL all they care about is selling your info and showing you ads so all we are too them are revenue makers for them and thats not right, they actually need to listen to what people dont like about the app and you guys dont even read the reports of what people report like i reported s3xual content that obviously violated the terms of service and i got a notification back less than 5 mins later saying it was reviewed and didnt violate any kind of terms of service violations like come on now fix this stupid app"
Dont see the point of it. I dont see the point of Instagram. It used to be a photo site but now it doesnt have any resonance with me. I post occasionally and keep in contact with several friends who use the platform. I put my commercial pictures on site where I can moneyize but putting content on Instagram is like being in a popularity competition with no prize
Instagram review. Rn my app is tripping from the update i have data and wifi and it wont even load up my timeline or anything
"Disappointed in the Lack of Customer Service. Ive tried reaching instagram through the help links provided and have not been able to reach a human going on 2 months now. Ive only received computer generated replies. Being a billion dollar app and platform for millions of people/businesses I would think that Facebook would create an efficient service to resolve issues. Not to mention the new update is not convenient. Im overall disappointed in the service and I expected more. Ive googled and found hundreds of other users experiencing the same problems. My instagram profile that Ive had since 2012 was wrongfully disabled and to make matters WORSE I dont even have the option of retrieving my profile data (pictures, videos, friends). DEVASTATED is an understatement. If I could give negative stars I would"
"Sharing. Perfect app for sharing photos, privately or publicly and opportunities to follow celebrities and other photographers that suit your personal interests. Love it "
Predatory Tracking. Have you seen the privacy nutrition labels? They are the equivalent of doom scrolling No thanks. #BREAKUPFACEBOOK
Spies. Terms Of Service = No Privacy
"Doesnt support HDR videos. Please fix Instagram to support HDR videos I take with my iPhone 12 pro. (Old review) Love this app, but now I can&#39;t share with Facebook. Instagram isn&#39;t showing up as an authorized app under facebook privacy settings, either. I also had the problem mentioned by others about uploads failing, but only when I wasn&#39;t on wifi"
"Hacked. My account was hacked and Instagram is not being helpful AT ALL. I keep getting emails that sends me to the help center, which is being no help whatsoever That was my personal account with my personal information You guys should take action and actually step in and take care of hackers"
No Customer Support. For months I have been trying to access my account but Instagram has not reached out or helped at all in trying to recover my information
"TikTok #2. If I wanted to have a tiktok I would just go download it. Why these developers think ripping off another app is a good idea makes no sense. Ive already deleted all my other social media accounts because of increasing ads, privacy concerns and ripping off tiktok. Instagram is also constantly changing their algorithm making it harder and harder for smaller businesses and artists to reach a new audience. Whats even worse is if you pay for a promotion (which only results in bots liking your post) all your new posts afterwards dont even come close to the numbers you were reaching before, ruining your algorithm and reach permanently. The only good thing Instagram has done in recent years is partner up with Spotify and their canvass feature. Thats it. Facebook needs to quit ruining Instagram"
"4/5. I give instagram a 4/5 bc its a vary good app their just one problem I would like to follow people and it says Action Blocked bc I recently unfriended all the followers I didnt know and I would like to like videos/pictures and follow new friends, and It wouldnt let me. This is just a personal  problem other wise Instagram is a great way to express yourself and I recommend you to download and have a blast (I just really need my problem fixed)"
"Help. I appreciate the quick responses and corrections for the issues Ive had. Thank you. Im very new to the business side of Insta, so Im not very fluent in the algorithms and how they work. I dont quite understand how to obtain followers.  I dont like that my profile seems to be categorized with other dog stores which is pointless, because other stores arent potential customers.  My profile keeps getting tagged with inappropriate pictures, since my profile is linked to the website they upload there too. Ive changed my settings to prevent that now but somehow they are still there in the background as if they are used to place my profile into a spam server or something, idk.  It seems like posts dont circulate unless you pay, especially on Facebook.  Plus paying only gets you false likes, the analytics show down to the millisecond how much time was spent on the site, what page, what products etc.  I feel like the clicks are computer generated and arent real potential customers.  My profile lost 100 followers overnight it seems and now for every follower I get I lose the same number.  Although I appreciate the followers I do have, it seems they are from countries in which I dont sell products, so again pointless.  How do I generate followers? How do I prevent the inappropriate tagging? How do I keep my profile from being spammed? What am I missing?"
Flopping. The one useful thing Instagram has was access data where it keeps a track of followers to requested and such and they get rid of it. Not top of that the app continues to downgrade. They better bring that feature back
"Too much sexism & misogyny & hateful commenting and no mediating. I have decided to permanently delete 2 business accounts and 1 personal account on the simple fact that after several reports filed on the slander, misogyny, sexism, and derogatory comments left by fake accounts and profiles (specifically the incels commenting on the @feminist page), and even sending these terrible comments in for a 2nd review, Instagram says that those comments dont go against their community guidelines. It is not in my moral, ethical, or mental health sphere to tolerate this from a social media platform. Thanks for the years of sharing, but the world is different now and full of hate (or people just feel more comfortable spreading it) and I refuse to partake in a platform that supports that"
"Like Over Love but Regardlessly Need. I love sharing and engaging on Instagram My two qualms: 1) I cant share stories (despite enabling all the things that are supposed to allow for this) from my business page to my personal page unless I send them as a DM, and 2) if I use text and a gif in a story post, the text appears for a nanosecond and then disappears, leaving just the gifs. Ive reluctantly accepted these issues and am sharing on here for awareness for both users and those empowered to make corrections based on what they learn from feedback"
"Hackers & spams :(. Instagram used to be my favourite application. However, so many people including myself have been hacked and Instagram doesnt CARE Hackers create fake pornographic account with our pictures, other hackers hack our account to send spammy messages and Instagram doesnt care :( pleaseeeeee Instagram do something, your app used to be my favourite app for business and personal as well, this situation is very stressful and unfortunate"
"Account was hacked. Instagram will give anyone access to your account but yourself. No support at all My account email and username was changed from someone in NIGERIA im in the US . I changed it to it wasnt me and they still gave them access again. They changed everything including phone # - I emailed, sent selfie video twice as requested and Nothing. DO NOT KEEP valuable pictures and vids on Instagram. It is NOT safe"
Im I the only one having this problem . I dont know why my Instagram not working on any of my phones its saying it cant connect like I was on wifi then I turn on my data which is unlimited so i dont understand why its saying it cant Connect like Instagram was working yesterday but only the other problem is when I watch people lives then its pause and says something about my connection when my data on  please can you fix it  
Discrimination. I have been reaching out over and over again. You guys have been flagging my page continuously for this that fo not go against Instagrams guidelines. I posted a picture sitting in my care fully clothed and that got flagged and when I appealed you all still said it went against guidelines. So at this point i feel like you all have bots working for you and or youre simply discriminating against larger women. Its happening way too frequently that Im being flagged for things that arent going against the guidelines. On top of that ImBrining flagged for things that were up over a year from now(14 months) so that to makes me believe Im being targeted by someone and yall are just going with what theyre flagging me for without actually taking a look. On top of me keep having to report fake pages of me
"Ridiculous, Stupid Limitations and Non-Permanence. There is a feature now that only allows you to change your name the bold part of your bio... once. Every 14 days? Why? There is NO reason to change this and its absolutely stupid, Instagram is already on thin ice with me for many other reasons. Non-permanence, there are different cute little features on each of my accounts, one of them was I had gradient cute little bubbles for my messages and all of a sudden its gone cause you wanted to use my and many other random accounts as guinea pigs for random features and then you dont even allow us to KEEP THEM, either dont use accounts as testers to let them see what they wish they could have forever aka flaws of the actual app or hire your own personal guinea pigs"
"Great app. The only social media I actually use regularly. The variety of posting options is huge, unlike some social medias where you can only post videos or only photos. Theres no text limit like Twitter, or anyone trying to obviously steal your data like Tik Tok. 10/10 would definitely recommend"
"Deleted review. Well Instagram a big thank you for continuing to suppress the words of your users. I aint even say nothin bad I just had suggestions. Instagram needs some features. Mainly a dislike button, False info or scummy profiles posting stuff to trick young users into liking or following. We also need a way to block a certain audio, I hate seeing a meme or a trendy video over and over and over and over. When a song and video pair becomes super popular and half the posts I see are just copies of the original. Ion care about people wanting to post their stuff but I dont want to see 100 people doing the exact same thing while scrolling. Bots are completely out of control. Major companies and even small creators have their comment section filled with fake women trying to sell their bodies. Or people self promoting using spam and hate speech to get people to check their profile. Its truly a disgusting and depraved thing to see in action, even massive companies like F1 and Airlines cant catch a break. These bots often get hundreds of likes instantly, their always at the top of a comment section. Now this is gonna be a more personal opinion, the above are objective problems with the app and actively harm not only the platform but everyone on it. Instagram should remove the ability to turn off comments, this goes along with false info, people trying to trick others especially young kids. The list goes on honestly, Instagram is gonna be remembered  like Twitter and discord, a place of hostility and suppression of opinions"
"App not working on Data (4G). I have had on going issues with the instagram application on my iphone 11. I cannot anything on the app whilst on mobile data (4G) but works perfectly fine on my phone WIFI. This has been happening on and off for months now, I have reported it to Instagram and still have had no luck. I have contacted Apple, they told me to contact Telstra and Telstra have said their are no issues with the network account. I have tried factory resetting my phone, reset all network settings and every other troubleshooting suggested by google with still no luck.Please fix the issue"
Blocking account. they have block my and my other friends account. That was my personal account and i have only my family members and childhood friends. Now i do not have my old picture which i have posted on instagram and deleted from my phone. I am no longer want to use instagram. I will file case on instagram in future for my lose. i have request to all that always take the copy of your memorial pictures in your as a backup
"Data vs. Wifi. I live in a decent location with a cell tower, and wifi that I can use any app with aside from Instagram. For some reason, when I am using wifi, IG stalls, doesnt play, and doesnt load, but as soon as I switch over to using my data, IG works 100%, but I dont like using my data because it costs me more in the end, I dont know if it is a problem with my wifi, as I said all my other apps work perfectly fine on my wifi connection, or if it is with the hardware in IG that is causing so many problems"
"I simply love Instagram. This is my most favorite App I love the myriad of pictures and posts, the ease of use and privacy. I also like shopping "
Dont have all the features. I enjoy this app immensely however find it frustrating that I dont have certain features such as share post to stories button and music add on to stories. All my privacy settings support the ability to do so and my app is updated so not sure why my app isnt the same as all other accounts
0 privacy. 0 privacy
"Instagram shouldnt be Facebook. Theres many reasons why generation z does not use Facebook and prefers Instagram. Turning Instagram into another Facebook is only going to turn these users away. Facebook is too cluttered and in no way user friendly. I now have a shopping tab on Instagram and thats very disappointing. I dont want to be sold anything while on the app. I also dont like how far removed the notifications are now. I used to check notifications all the time, but now its more complicated to get there.Stop making IG another Facebook"
"Been going downhill a lot recently. Instagram used to be a great app with amazing features, but recently it has been going downhill. About a year or two ago, Instagram updated so only the person who posts something can see the total number of likes. There was no harm in others seeing it, so why did they feel like it needed to be changed?For the longest time Insta had a great button placement. Notifs, new posts, home and explore were all easily accessible, as they were the most used buttons. Now theyve moved them all around several times over the course of a few weeks. They also removed new posts and notif buttons and replaced them with two buttons nobody ever uses. Once again, whats the point in changing something thats already good?Theyre now testing out removing the share feature, which allows you to share posts to your story. This is an absolutely stupid idea, it will completely ruin the whole aspect of posting. And their new TOS is horrible. They think they can access every single aspect of your data, including photos, text messages and more personal info that SHOULD STAY PERSONAL. Its a great app and all, but theyre very rapidly digging their own grave with all of their terrible updates"
We are the product. My original Instagram account was hacked and stolen by Sophia.lee.tt. I had over 1000 followers and even more pictures. I have proof that it was my account Ive tried to contact Instagram but they do NOTHINGI hate how difficult it is to allow access to new photos now
"Used to be good. Now the new interface is awful, trying to force us into the market place and other crap that Im not remotely here for. Also LET US CONTROL OUR NOTIFICATIONS. I dont care if Johnny is on Instagram, and Ive turned off all notifications except direct messages, yet Im STILL hounded by these annoying notifications. I hope Facebook is forced to sell Instagram because its become crap since they took over"
"Too many ads. This used to be a fun way to connect with friends through pictures. Now you have to scroll through one ad per post by your friends. Sorry, I didnt want to spend that much time on here and waste this much data"
"Instagram. I love you guys give me the right amount of privacy I understand whats going on so yes I try my best to be careful posting anything that may send anyone any subjective messages involving,negatively, or bad words  Thank you guys so much I hope yall are the best of days rn"
Tracking. Hate how this app access my microphone and google searches and instantly shows me advertisements on my feed. Thankful apple gave us the ability to stop tracking. Thanks Apple
"Instagram Spies on iMessages PROOF. Over 20 times in the past 2 months Ive noticed extremely unique snippets of data from my iMessages are being converted into meme content on my Instagram wall and it always happens 48hrs after I write or receive an iMessage.Instagrams official Purely coincidence excuse is utter BS. Apple, Tim Cook... Im going to the media and DOJ with my proof if you dont stop this nazi wiretapping backdoor tactic to scrape meta data. This is clear invasion of privacy.I will make waves. Go ahead delete this review. You will hear from me one way or another"
Instagram. First I like to say how I love Instagram I love watching videos I love posting and watching stories and other parts but one of the problems I have with Instagram is that is one of the most Glichy apps Ive ever hadThis sometimes can be a huge inconvenience but most of the time it is also used so much of my data but I do feel it is worth
"2 Easy Fixes and 1 Eternal Sin. 1) one star removed for the clunkiness of the public vs private distinction. As a shy extrovert who values my privacy, I would like an intermediate privacy setting where my posts and stories are visible to people following me AND people I follow. That way I can share content about my favourite bands and artists who wont follow a nobody like me without having to set my profile to public and expose my posts to every misogynist and irrelevant marketing bot2) another star removed because I think that when posts with multiple images are saved into a Saved folder, the image that is open when you press save should be the one displayed in the folder, not the first image in the post3) a third and final star removed because I miss having a chronological feed and your algorithm will never compare the beauty and inevitability of the passage of time"
"I am giving it a 1 star cause I need a response from Instagram. I filled out a survey about opinions about being left out, discriminated against religion, race, political beliefs. I know this isnt my app but I do love this app and Im worried about this becoming a media that only holds one opinion to its beliefs and blocks the rest out. an example being: Im a Christian, I do not support lgbtq+ but Im not going to ever go out of my way to be rude to them nor would I invade their privacy or harm nor threaten them because ofc threatening is illegal, and Im not going to condemn anyone, Im in no place to. But Im afraid that this app will censor me for having my own opinion. You cant have a set of opinions from a survey and make rules for that majority of people when theres another majority who dont feel the same. Also isnt it discriminating against other races to push black owned businesses up front? People would say its discriminating if someone put white owned in their business. Its simply just a color, nothing more. Thats all I have, thanks for listening"
privacy concerns. privacy concerns over instagram for kids and so many bots also why do i need to log into a browser to delete my account? thanks
"Hacked / fake accounts. Instagram has so many accounts getting hacked and they refuse to do much about it. Regardless of how many times the accounts are reported as being hacked, they just give you the option to block/restrict the account in question. Extremely unprofessional and dangerous"
"Not a neutral platform. Poor and unethical business practices, biased management, censorship and restrictive distribution of content for a wide group of users. Most importantly, lack of support for its users and paying clients with robotic/automated responses most of the time. Its a matter of time before Facebook and its group of app are a thing of the past if they dont become a neutral social platform respecting the rights, views and privacy of their users"
"Instagram. My Instagram was disabled for Violating their terms. I was obviously hacked. They emailed me asking for a picture of my face with a code written on a paper, which I have done, and I have heard nothing and still cant get in.... just want my Instagram back"
Banning freedom of speech. Worst app ever no privacy they have access to users profile and banning freedom of speech By removing hashtags and videos
"Instagram Needs Leadership Change. Seriously, Im not sure whats happening at Instagram but they need to figure it out. All the changes they keep making to their design will decrease people using the app. This comes from someone who runs a personal and professional account"
"Spammers and scammers paradise. Insta needs to seriously get a grip with its platform the amount of fake accounts posing as real people far outweighs the genuine accounts. When people have their identities stolen and their pics used for Bitcoin, fake onlyfans etc insta dont want to know and refuse to take notice of the many support requests. Yet a guy posts a pic in his underwear or with his shirt off Insta come down like a ton of bricks and threaten to delete the account. Insta needs to take privacy and security much more seriously, a more stringent account set up wouldnt go amiss I hovered around 700 followers in the end because I just couldnt trust the requests I was getting to be genuine. The worst thing is, if you have any communication with your followers and their account is hacked you are instantly hit with blackmail attempts even if your conversations were nothing to write home about. So Insta sort this absolute cesspit out"
Its cool ig. Its a really good app. I wish that it didnt allow parental controls cuz then it kinda ruins relationships and it ruins friendships if u arent able to get back to them. And its good if u want ur  privacy cuz u can just have a private account. Soooooooo just try to change that one thing
Privacy settings are a joke. Thanks Instagram for your garbage privacy settings that dont work Whats the point in turning off tagging ability if youre just going to still notify me
"PLEASE TAKE NOTICE. Can you make a feature like archive but where you can see alllll of your previously deleted pictures/ videos? Or if not, Atleast be able to data download all of your pictures youve ever posted on Instagram.  Because before archive option was ever I thing I pictures I wish I could have archived.  And I would love to put back in chronological order on my profile based off the date I originally posted it"
"Totalitarian App. Disabled my account for expressing my freedom of speech and broke the privacy policy which both parties agreed to, as there was not policy broken to justify the disabling of my account. It was also linked to my Facebook account which was also deleted. Customer service never responds and no one claims responsibility. All my contacts and information are now deleted forever. A new app/business will take advantage of this flaw in Facebooks business model"
"Ideas shared from around the globe . Ive been on Instagram for about a year and Ive really been enjoying the content. So many different countries are represented on the platform. I love how easy it is to find and make new friends l, as well as seeking my old pals as well.  I love going through my photos on my cellphone and deciding which ones Ill share. My page is my personal blog and Im enjoying offering positive messages.Thanks for letting me share and make new friends"
Privacy. Not liking the INTRUSIVENESS ZUCKERBUG
"Censorship is for the dogs. Thanks to the new crappy update and the extra info yall just couldnt leave alone. I deleted the app and deleted my account. I wont be back unless you reverse these privacy crossing  updates. Also, Im just one person, but there are many  many others leaving. Censorship is for animals"
"Instagram unprofessional Employees Conflict of interests. Due to personal interests of your employees with armenian roots, we are struggling of removing our independent opinions, comments and messagesI suggest you to be more professional, objective and avoid the conflict of interests among your team members"
Wont load. My Instagram wont load and theres nothing wrong with my data because its working for everything else
"Bad bad privacy issues. Someone hacked my Instagram account and changed my username and email and password,anyway I reported my Instagram from family and friends Instagrams about my problem people reporting it over 100 times and you guys didnt see to see anything wrong and let the hacker take over my Instagram and look at all my kids pictures.I finally managed to log back in and after looking at login details it clearly shows a hacker hacked my account with their email address and Instagram didnt even send me an email of suspicious activity so my review in writing this is to advice people please dont post pictures of your kids or even yourself because when you get hacked Instagram doesnt help at all.Luckily for me I got my account back and a code sent to my mobile but it took hours and hours.Instagram I have proof of all the login details and that you never sent me any suspicious activity or anything to my email address,such a shame especially from a big developer like you.You guys need to have a email address for urgent problems your support email no longer works.A contact number would be better.Lucky Im a mature woman not a teenager,you do know people with mental health issues can do crazy things when they have been hacked and cant get any help,its now been over 40 hours and guess what you guys havent still contacted me or any of my friends who reported this,shame on you Instagram,I definitely dont feel safe god only knows what this hacker has done with all my kids pictures"
"Anti-social social app. By tucking away and making it hard to reach both Activity tab and Camera tab, Instagram became the ironic joke on social media. Whats the point of posting, if you cant see instant, in real time reactions comments and likes? By putting Shop and Reels in the most prominent area, Instagram states clearly its new priorities and its not about pictures or bringing closer friends and family.Grouping likes in the Activity tab is a step back as far as socializing too, making it hard to interact with individuals when they are all clumped together. Instead of individual accounts, you see anonymous number and others"
"f*ck off. over the past few years Instagram has downgraded quite a bit. there has been a HUGE increase in adds and also they took away the feature to see what other people were liking. But it dose not stop there, they moved the shop to where the notifications used to be, and that is just a dick move. they also have been accused of spying on people through their cameras... Overall, since Facebook bought Instagram it has changed focuses from an app that is built around the user and their enjoyment to an app that is built to maximize profit at the expense of the users enjoyment.  Very disappointed"
privacy problems. when i unrestricted someone every time i go to send them a post i have to search up theyre name because it wont go back to the top of the list even after talking for a while
"Changed for the worst. Instagram used to be an app where people took beautiful pictures. Its turned into an online market, where youre constantly being sold something you dont want. You can even see the content of your pictures as influencers are pushed first. Horrible and trying to find a way to delete the app"
Instagram please make an update. The app is good very user friendly but the Instagram filters are a built faulty as when you have recorded yourself the app sometimes either shuts down or refuses to save data. Also please make an update where you are able to change the cover of your post or Rearrange the photos in your album post. To change how it looks on your feed. Overall great app but a few changes need to be made
"Doesnt work with mobile data. Instagram is a great app, I use it all the time, but it just doesnt work when I use my mobile data. All my other apps load with it, but instagram just says connection error when I open the app.I have tried deleting Instagram and redownloading it, but that still didnt work and I also have mobile data turned on for instagram. Thanks for reading"
End this monopoly. -Instagram started as a decent app but has fallen as it attempted to steal concepts from other apps such as reals.-The amount off garbage Instagram feeds you on a daily bases is staggering. -It has led to where stealing other peoples content is encouraged. -In addition the terms and service agreement is extremely invasive.The only reason I still have Instagram is because my friends are on it and it has become a personal networking collection. Despite this most of the time all I see are garbage reposts often from compilation accounts that fail to give credit. I would happily switch to any competitor in an instant if they existed
"draining data . my wifi works just fine , but when i get on instagram its slow &amp; never working unless i turn my data on . this doesnt happen with any other apps only instagram . thanks for draining all my data instagram"
Daily. Good. Instagram is really good. I dunno where they got the name from. But there are some bugs from time to a long time. Like right now Im experiencing the add your birthday bug. You should get this. Better than any other. But pls I wanna use less wifi data. Ad developers please check Instagram from time to time to see if theres any bugs and stuff
"World's Crappiest Algorithm App. Ad spamming, broken notifications, absolute no customer service, unknown suspensions, riddled with bots, no camera privacy, harassment to confirm email, not kept chronologial, poor resolution upload, invasion of privacy, sells your data, greedy fat cats and much more. There&#39;s literally NO reason to support such a trash app. I also find it very interesting how they&#39;re always having &#34;bug fixes updates&#34; yet literally nothing changes. It actually ends up worse. Extremely shady and flat out illegal practices here. Please ditch this &#34;service&#34;, people It&#39;s long overdueEdit: You can&#39;t even search up anything and if you do it MUST be conveniently put in the &#34;explore&#34; page with those reels and live feeds or whatever, and the algorithm puts on top random products to shop with a shopping tab. Nobody comes on IG to shop and now they&#39;re forcing users to to use this like QVC/HSN. It&#39;s not about your own customized feeds anymore, it&#39;s about what can they get to sell you. Either your time, attention, or wallet, you have to manually search up who you want to see now. The &#34;all caught up&#34; checkmark comes when you view like 3 people. I follow thousands and when I search individually to pages there&#39;s posts I haven&#39;t seem for months And I wonder what happened to certain users in my feed? They hide and shuffle them under a rug just so your attention is on something else that&#39;s not important in ads to sell you something so IG gets more revenue. I&#39;m sick of modern social media, and once again, please people, ditch this garbage already and let&#39;s start anew all over again. This main chain is so messed up"
Data. Steals data but I still use it sadly
"Remove suggested posts. I dont want to see any posts from people Im not following. I understand ads. But now my entire newsfeed is filled with posts from people I dont follow, and I cant keep track of the posts I actually want to follow. The update sucks and will make me use Instagram less, not more"
Data mining and engagement algorithms. Is it really worth images of food and dancing videos? Maybe a vacation pic? You gave your rights away for nothing
"Instagram was good until Facebook bought it. And its gone downhill ever since. I remember the days when Instagram was good. No complicated algorithm. Content was seen. It was fun to post. Now its a chore. And now Instagram is seemingly blocking, disabling and restricting accounts for no reason whatsoever, including my own, instead of removing the thousands of actual spam accounts on the platform. Report the issue and you get no response. No customer service. It doesnt care about personal accounts with small followings because its not making any money off us. Instagram: Bringing you closer to the people and things you love. Ha, what joke Bottom line, its a business"
Too many bots and scammers stealing profiles. Instagram is overrun with fake profiles and bots and scammers stealing well established profiles . Instagram seems not to care and does little to remove them. Not a secure place anymore and it makes me wonder how long people will tolerate it before leaving. instagram needs to get on top of this before its too late . They should also do something to help those whos profiles have been hacked and they are locked out .. reporting fake profiles is useless as they do nothing about it. Very sad
Account hacked. There are fake accounts who send u false messages they copy other accounts from your friends list asking for help and thats your account hacked if u help out on the link it look so genuine until its to late .::I sent Instagram management an email with a photo of my main account  has been hacked  so they sent me a link to get it back they changed my mobile and email address I done last login and it turned out to be in New York USA it was the area code that give it away so now everything is changed  Instagram it would be nice if u  track the hackers and get them done
"Instagram has 0 customer support. Instagram connects me to my friends, and check out my relationship , I frequently checked my personal page and its email was changed and reset to my okd phone number. A month has passed and after several emails and attempts to reach out to customer service and troubleshooting, I have no access to my personal account"
"This is ridiculous. Its a real shame that no stars isnt an option on here. I signed up for an account, and am immediately kicked off for suspicious activity? How can there be suspicious activity on an account that has existed for all of thirty seconds? And now you want MORE of my personal information to verify and log in to the account I JUST made? Absolutely not You do not require all of this information for your corporate Orwellian dictatorship, its ludicrous; no privacy policy is ever 100% guaranteed to protect peoples information and you keep demanding more. Not. Happening. Why give the option of signing up with phone OR email, when youre just going to demand it/both and other private information after the fact? Delete this app, its not worth the time nor any supposed benefits people claim this supposedly has. Dont waste the storage space"
"Personal use vs Business use. The personal use side of Instagram works fine and Im happy with how I can interact with my friends and family however, when I started my business I needed to use Instagram to promote my service and this is where I came across account suspension and I have not been able to access the account since. The business was purely legitimate and we had a large amount of customers interested. The next morning we opened the app and we no longer have access to the account. I have been contacting Instagram and there is no single way of asking for support. Its endless loops and false trails, drove me to leave a negative review. According to the Instagram guidelines we have been caught doing something wrong. I genuinely dont know what was wrong about sharing videos and pictures of my business. However we have  Instagram Model who are able to post images leaving little to the imagination. Baring in mind I have a younger sibling who is able to access my phone and my Instagram if he stumbles upon these Instagram Models according to the guidelines this is perfectly normal but posting 2 or 3 stories of my business is completely wrong and is suspension worthy.... outraged by this shambolic service. 1/10"
"There is no way Instagram has 4.8 stars. As of today every fourth post in your feed is an advertisement. I first got on Instagram a few months after it initially released. While I think some features that have been added are pretty neat, like the explore page, messages to share posts, and I accept stories as being a standard feature these days, most of whats been added in the last year has been unneeded for an app centered around sharing images. I dont come to Instagram to shop, thats what Amazon is for. I already miss several of my friends new posts because of the almighty algorithm and jumbled timeline. Fortunately, instead of seeing posts from people I follow, I get ads. Just what I wanted. In all seriousness, does a company part of the billion dollar conglomerate called Facebook really need ad revenue when it rakes in enough to maintain their over $100B operating costs from selling user data?"
"Unhealthy mess. I feel that Instagram is all over the place now, it is trying to do to much, it can be a place for keeping up to date with your life, as well as a home place for sharing art, for memes and funny things, for serious conversation & for very personal things as well. I think this is a big reason so many people have separate accounts for separate purposes. For me Instagram typically isnt fun, no matter what purpose I open it for all the other things are being shoved down my throat. I feel this is inescapable now even with creating other accounts, if I just want to post & look at art, still suggestions of people I know or celebrities I do not care about are unavoidable.  This is further reinforced by the constant barrage of ads. To the point I would gladly pay for a version of Instagram where I am not distracted endlessly by said ads and a shallow attention diverting explore Page that carries nothing real or of substance for me. Please allow Instagram to be the app it was where you can tailor it for whatever use you like, instead of trying to do everything and just being an amalgamation of all the worst things of social media"
"Not a Safe Platform. Instagram not only refuses to take down actual hateful, evil content and users, but is also censoring and shutting down accounts of people who havent done anything wrong. Their priorities are very clear, and their new TOS cracks down even harder on things like emojis that suggest sexual activity instead of focusing on the rot from within. Deleting the app from my phone. Tired of getting harassed by actual white supremacists wishing me dead, only to get a passive message from Instagram about how they didnt violate any rules. (Even though they absolutely did.) Meanwhile, one of my posts got taken down yesterday for including music in the background. Until Instagram makes a commitment to tackling the real issues on the app, Im not interested in giving them my support or money"
"Facebook connectivity problems. Considering Facebook OWNS Instagram, I would think linking the two would be easier. I have two instagrams and two Facebook pages. One of each is for my personal stuff and hobbies, the other is for sharing my woodworking. I wish that when I went to my woodworking Insta, I could EASILY share it to my Facebook. Same with my personal pages. Instead, every time I switch accounts I have to reconfigure my settings to share between the two apps. Why? Why is this needed. Why cant I set it so my woodworking Insta shares to my woodworking Facebook. And same with my personal accounts"
"In a word . WARNING: Think carefully before you join INSTAGRAM. INSTAGRAM seemingly allows the THEFT of INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS and FAILS to ACT appropriately... TO RETURN IT TO RIGHTFUL OWNERAs others have similarly reported, 18 months ago (while on holiday) I missed an email from Instagram (to an old email address) asking me to confirm that attempts to change my password to my little-used account were made by me. A week after missing this single email my account was hacked/stolen by unknown individual(s) in Russia. Alarmingly it was promptly used to follow 5,000 plus individuals unknown to me - many of whom look dubious (and giving the impression that &#39;I&#39; -as the named account holder - engage in questionable online activity).  I have heard of the same happening to countless other users of Instagram. Like other frustrated Instagram users, since the theft I have repeatedly written to Instagram and contacted cyber crime services to try to restore the account to my control (via another account). The only time Instagram responded and did anything was to incorrectly read my message and give me unnecessary access to the account I had just used to send the message (which clearly I had no problems accessing) rather than investigate the stolen account that I had provided details of ... duh  Since then they have failed repeatedly to take action.My Instagram account was fortunately not my business account but I do want the rightful control of it returned to me so that I can delete asap the dubious thousands being followed under my name. Additionally  I am having to change passwords more than ever to try to prevent the fraudsters in Russia (and numerous other countries in their apparent network) from hacking the email account that the stolen Instagram account was linked to. Every so often I receive tens of emails in Russian from Instagram which I assume are linked to my stolen account. Meantime, who knows what the fraudsters may be doing with my photos and what dubious purposes they are using my account for under MY name.My account contained less than 20 carefully considered images of landscapes and a few of my adult children. I was following less than 20 people/artists. I assume it is now being used to follow the 5,000 + self-publicists for monetary gain ... and more.APP USERS: If you decide to use Instagram, check daily for messages - especially if you have it linked to an old email address. Be prepared to lose your account and your images permanently otherwise - even if your account is private.INSTAGRAM: Please take action re Identity theft when reported and read    with care and accuracy the messages customers send. On the very rare occasion that you do respond to a customer - at least make it worthwhile and effective by responding with a viable and relevant answer"
"The most awful social media company. What a disgusting place to be, they lock you out of your account while allowing celebrities to post porn, children are not safe here, they steal your information and sell it to the highest bidder, they violate your freedom of speech and delete photos for no reason, they allow bullys and predators to freely move and block those that report the behaviour they break the law everyday and they do not communicate with you, they act like they are special and they advertising and pages cant be trusted, they are so far below the CRTC Standards I personally would consider moving this social media to the black net its where the garbage belongs. And they still cant figure out what Tic Tock is .I am sure children work there they have issues with someone commenting on a picture the person stole of the internet it isnt of them they dont the person but oh dont say anything, but if you are a sexually predator and hates woman its all good"
"App has selective updates/Awful support. Instagram hasnt been fun since 2019. Now theyre run by new ppl Meta and they disable your account for the STUPIDEST things. called my friend b*tch now my account of 6 years is GONE All the memories in my archive gone You cant even appeal the decision because instagram doesnt check anything or respond back Go to twitter and search instagram disabled and youll see thousands of stories like this. Made a new account and now only my business account has all the updates, but my personal account has nothing, not even the reels feature"
"Zero Stars. This app used to be great but its way to toxic at least for me now, so many people working so hard just to be something on some app not realizing all their personal information and privacy is being taken, after Instagram passed the new update that gives them full access to your phone I was out lol people should live in the moment a little more and joy revolve their life around social media. Twitter is fantastic, if you enjoy talking to people about things you enjoy, Twitter is for you"
"Retained log in information. Unlike Facebook, on log out, my information to my account is still saved and can easily log back in without a password . There is no option to remove this information from the app"
"Issues of concern Updated. Before I begin, I wish to thank you for taking the time &amp; patience to read my lengthy review.I dont know how to rate the app. Because I see the great potential of the app &amp; the numerous issues( from over 1M reviews to date.  In light of this, I have decided to give it a 1 star review.My issues are the following:Your website: (experienced Oct.31/2020).   I  found that the website &amp; app are not synced properly. Namely, the option of where to send a code when reactivating an account. The information from my account did not correspond to where the code was to be sent. Hence, a security issueThe app (installed Oct.28/2020).   Your app has a lot of Issues. It messed up my phone. Namely, standard device pop up  notifications appearing in non-related apps (unusual). My email configurations which are protected were altered. This is surely a security violation. I diligently check certain areas of my phone. In my ICloud backup, also protected, your app showed with the toggle switch on. This to me is a violation of security &amp; without  permission. Please note it is not the first time I downloaded the app.I then deleted the app &amp; reinstalled it, nothing changed. Shut off &amp; even forced shut the phone, nothing changed.  The final step I took, was to cancel my account, delete the app, &amp; reset all the settings of my phone which removed all the issues.         3.  Lastly, I noticed that both your website &amp; app needs to be streamlined &amp; synced.  There are areas in your settings which should be password protected. Also, enhanced security.      ***4. Additional Update***I have read your privacy policy. I personally found the collection of information to be somewhat excessive and logically, in some cases, not necessary. As mentioned in my opening statement, the app has great potential &amp; hope that in the short future it can become a quality product"
Absolute surveillance. Read the new terms and conditions for 20 December youll see that zuckerberg is now the ultimate spy merchant. Every single thing on your phone and what you do will now be recorded and monitored and will be the property of Instagram  Wake up sheeple
Instagram is stinky. Im here to complain about petty things no one cares about .My minecraft girlfriend left me and its because Instagram ... didnt really do anything lol Im just here to laugh at the dramatic comments that people leave WHO CARES ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD THAT YOU CANT STALK WHAT PEOPLE LIKE .. privacy exists yknow
"Doesnt work at all. The latest update which I received today basically doesnt work at all. Did anybody QA this update? How did it get past Apple.(Ohh, ohh, I know Apple typically does not test that updates from previous versions work, and only tests for fresh install. I know this because I am a developer.)It displays a new splash screen, which now adds the kind from Facebook.And then the app closes.Now need to search for instructions on how to delete my account. As I am sure that login with Facebook is coming soon. I wont do that. Never had a Facebook account, never will.Facebook is not serious enough about data security. I have been willing to use Instagram after the acquisition only because it has not required real identity.For others waning to stay. I would guess you will have to uninstall and reinstall the app.  Nice if Instagram had told you that"
Privacy. Return my privacy
"Facebook has tanked this app. This app has gone to cr*p since FB took over.  Theyre trying to be TikTok now, but their editing tools are abysmal.  But if you dont hack together constant videos they just bury your content.  This is a photo/ image app and you can no longer just share images.  And the whole place is rampant with fake spam accounts.  Post literally anything and watch the first half a dozen comments just be spam.  But if you report those comments, they dont actually bother to remove them  Apparently FB thinks those are fine  Not to mention the dms of spam.  I stopped replying to dms or checking them because its all spam bots. So slow clap to Facebook for f*ing up yet another thing"
Gross invasion of privacy. New terms of use is Orwellian and Im surprised more people arent angry about it
"Cosmetic Updates Ruined it; New Terms of Use are Invasive. I used Instagram for three years and was obsessed. The creative outlet, reconnecting with old friends, staying in touch with loved ones, meeting new friends, marketing for my photography business. But I deleted it today because of the Dec 20, 2020 new privacy policies. It was an easier choice than Id think bc all the rapid updates this year really aggravated me-changing up the story fonts, adding reels, changing the nav bar, changing DMs to messenger, adding store, changing the algorithm so much I cant even see my friends posts anymore, censorshipso many you cant even keep track. It really buttered me up for this divorce.The fact that Instagram can go through my background apps, texts, other devices using my network and such is just a no. Especially because there is no warning accept button for this; you consent by continuing usage of Instagram. We just want the old Instagram back. Not this invasive, crowded Facebook-gram. Please make Instagram simple again"
"Identity Verification for People of Color Needs Improvement. Of course I enjoy the instagram app on my iPhone If curated well, the app an incredible source of inspirationHowever, I must share a recent shared experience in hopes for improvement...The instagram account of myself and a friend were both hacked at similar times by the same malicious attackers. To regain access to our accounts, we were prompted by the app to provide a video selfie. I being a white person, passed the review in a matter of hours. My friend on the other hand who is a person of color, had to submit her video selfie seven times over several days to prove it was her- all the while being locked out of her account. Both of our Instagram accounts are loaded with photos of our faces, including our profile pictures. While Instagrams facial recognition technology is marvelous, it must still be improved so that we can ALL benefit equally"
"Updates that never work. My Instagram is a nightmare I dont have all the features everyone else has even after updates I cant add music to my stories, I cant reply to DM messages with any emojisMy friend works for insta and has told me about a hold out list where insta add peopleTo the list and they dont get any new features added to their account which to be is ridiculous, how can you pick and choose who deserves features and who doesnt I have 3 accounts 2 business and 1 personal and I have issues with all 3"
Mackenzie. Instagram is one of my favorite apps I downloaded it two days ago and Im obsessed its so amazing and its awesome how well they protect your privacy with other people
"Dishonest, Data Sellers, Corrupt. Your app is the trash bucket of American gag news and cheap Chinese products"
"Atrocious. This app used to be worth using and fun at that. But it has since become a predatory app that sneakily tracks my data and then harasses you with advertisements. The people who run this app are the worst dregs of humanity, and clearly lack any morals, or any human decency. They sell your information for a hefty paycheck. Stay away from this absolutely disgusting and disgraceful app"
Instagram is also Chinese owned. I just found out that Facebook (and therefore Instagram) is actually owned by the Chinese. Mark zuckerberg has been selling off shares to the ccp for several years now Im glad I decided to get off when I did. I value my privacy and def do not want the Chinese in my business
i. Just another data harvesting app. Oh and you can post pictures
One of my fav social medias but. I love this app and have spent an embarrassing amount of time on it but you guys really need to make an update so users can see whos not following them back in their following list. Its so frustrating because if someone unfollows me i want to be able to see that so i can unfollow back but i cant and if i try to use a different app to track my unfollowers you guys flag my account its really just ridiculous. That one little update would improve the quality of this app so much and im pretty sure A LOT of people agree with me
Eh. I dont like the fact that they need to know my information on where I am and accessing my camera without my permission... probably going to delete soon
Mr. The App is no good because accessing your information despite security in the App is activated
This app is legit. The app has many people on it I can keep track of my church and baseball and football
Deleted. This app does not need my health and fitness data.   They dont need a shopping button either.   Protect your children from this invasive app looks into your contact info also
"Ads every 3-4 posts . On top of this app, like so many, stripping your privacy for you to use it, tons of ads. I counted and it is generally one sponsored post (ad, often times in form of a video which zaps battery and data) per 3 posts. Sometimes 4 but more often 3"
My connection. My connections where Im at is very good and my data . But ever since I went to school and connected to there WiFi my Instagram havent been loading and Im not even on my school WiFis no more Im on my wifi and my insta wont load on data or my wifi
"100% recommended. I love Instagram so much I use it a lot and its just so fun I will admit, sometimes you can loose track of time using the app, but its not a problem the creators created. I love how you can have so many different accounts The best bit is, all this happiness and laughs that Instagram has created for me is all free 5 stars, 100% recommended"
"Do NOT LIKE New Updates At All. Still love using IG, but getting very turned off with being bombarded on my page and kids pages with advertisements of people/groups to follow. Whats the point of having it private when IG is not respecting the personal space of users with advertisements, especially some that are offensive? I spend more time hitting Hide Ad Not interested more than ever. I hope this changes soon"
"No customer support. I love Instagram but unfortunately, after being hacked recently, myself and most of my business using friends are leaving the app in droves because it does nothing to support users whose accounts are hacked. If someone turns on two factor, changes the email and phone number, your only option is the video verification route, which is CONSISTENTLY declined, even with ample photos in the profile. Not cool. Theres not even a way to have the account shut down. Hundreds of friends have reported my account for the fraudulent activity happening and its still running"
Expect  ZERO help if youve been hacked. I was HACKED by someone in Nigeria never been there logged in there but yet Instagram allowed them access from an unknown device let them change my PW emails and phone numbers so now my security login codes go to the HACKERS and Instagram will just send you through an endless loop of nothing with help desk features that dont work or that flat out dont exist I have been a long time FB and Instagram user and in linking my FB l should have been granted an extra layer of security but NOPE I have no idea what to do now other than to write this review and hope it gets a developer response because this feels wrong on so many levels a billion users and they do very little to protect these accounts
"PRIVACY OFFENSE. i found an account which was sharing my photo, and made it his profile photo. I reported but it wasnt deleted. WHY?"
Eh. Hate the discover people pop up on the individual users profile. Hate how much data is taken and sold without the ability to opt out (as is supposed to be legally available to CA residents)
Stop Palestinian censorship. Its astonishing how far the Palestinian censorship at Instagram and Facebook is going Censoring Bella Hadids picture of her fathers passport that had the word Palestine in it is astonishing how far Instagram goes to censor Palestinian existence. Compare that with how they refuse to even fact check the fake news and hate speech spewed by Trump
"Push to Facebook Business Page. After update, some people can no longer send content to our Facebook Business Page that is linked to our personal. It gives me the option to send to my business page through Instagram Settings, but then it always defaults back to my personal page"
2021 and still no ipad app. - Owned by evil Facebook- Collects your private information and shares to thousands advertises- Changes privacy policy to enable more spying on your activity- not even bothering developing an ipad specific app
"Slanderous practices. Consider this a cease and desist. If you dont cease to drag my name through the mud with your fact-checking liars, I shall bring forward a class action lawsuit on behalf of myself, and the many Canadians that are equally as livid. My claim shall outline your companys intent to do harm, by misleading the public. For your efforts to manipulate public perception, by impeding our right to freedom of speech, as well as our process of fair unbiased debate amongst our scientific and political communities. Additionally, for the fact that we have been entrapped into terms and conditions, completely contrary to those from when we first joined your platforms. On Facebook for example, I have 17 years of photos and posts, which I would have to delete one-by-one to completely remove all of my intellectual property from your server, and I no longer consent to my data being sold to third parties for your corporations own personal gains. I will be requiring a portion of the proceeds as compensation, if you continue to use it in such fashion"
I hate Facebook. Facebook bought it I think that should be self explanatory. I left Facebook because they have terrible privacy and ad terms. Then they buy Instagram. Now the ads are out of control and stalk everything I like. And literally every day of the week I get a scam account posing as a women adding me to a group. I report it and my account is on private. Thanks Mark cuckerberg
Insta tock. Use to really like Instagram for keeping up with friends and being inspired by other photographers. But my feed is now full of the same uninspired garbage videos with the same audio tracks over and over. Time to look for another platform I guess. Good job Instagram 
"Only used because theres nothing else like it. Terrible customer service. Broken moderation and a lackluster report system. Cryptic algorithm and an awful post feed. Invasive data collection. An update cycle thats treated like a social experiment, stealth adding features to random users without telling. With each update comes a new pointless add-on that no one asked for, that breaks 5 features introduced in the update before. I use it like everyone else does, and the only reason anyone has it is because the Facebook (sorry, mEtA) monopoly has no competition. Theres no need to elaborate further than this, because youll experience every issue on a weekly basis. It is low quality given its budget and popularity, and its annoying that its the only social media like it"
No privacy. InVasive
"No Support When Account is Hacked. Ive begged the bots at Instagram for two weeks to help me get my @agingracefullyatanta account back from the criminals that hacked into it, changed my pw and email locking me out. The bots at support in Instagram just spit out the same cookie cutter emails that are useless bc I cant simply reset the pw when it was changed by hackers The hackers are posting and sending horrible spam about bit coins to my contacts. Ive dmd, emailed and repeatedly pleaded for a HUMAN at Instagram to help me. Dont download this app unless you want your info compromised then NO help from the insta bots"
"Glitch. Ive had a business account for ages to see my insights and now changed back to personal account but Instagram wont take away the category off my bio, and it wont let me switch it on account information either, what do I do"
"Need more privacy options. I love the app would like more privacy options. Can the new update include the option to have a private my friends list at least to where it only shows mutual friends. Option to where stories show public, only your followers, or ppl you follow back. Comments same preference. The main one would be being able to your private friends list or who you are following"
"Facebook ruined the app. today, i deleted both facebook and instagram because of privacy (tracking) concerns, advertising invasion, constant urge for shopping, updates that remove beloved features, updates that over-simplify the app, and just the overall way that Facebook is going with the app"
"New Terms. The invasion of privacy, as well as censorship"
"Huge UX opportunity in tagging. Its surprising that Insta hasnt released a privacy feature within the @mention privacy settings section that allows users to choose any one person in particular that they are following and turn off tagging mentions for that one person. We only left with 3 options? Everyone,  no one, or people we follow. Why cant this be personalized? I have certain family members who love to tag me in literally every single giveaway they come across. It would create a better experience if I could subtly fix the problem on my end without having to block them completely or turn off all tagging"
Politics at their worst. I am growing increasingly frustrated with social media apps blocking most right wing posts for  Spreading disinformation but anything supporting the left is Free speech. Twitter blocked the leader of the free world for disinformation and incitement but doesnt seem to have a problem when worse is used against him and his supporters. Their team can manage to block posts but cant seem to the issue of sex bots designed to get your personal information. I dont even look forward to coming on the app anymore because any of the pages I want to see regularly I have to go add to a list and even then they get pushed aside for paid pages
"Music on stories. Recently i lost access to a lot of music on my instagram stories apparently due to me being a business account but i have a private personal account. Also no one asked for all these new dumb updates, used to be a good app now just got dead"
"One thing. I love Instagram and talking to my friends, seeing posts and everything. But the call options are a bit uncomfortable for me. When you do video call your icon pops in the corner and I personally dont like that, i liked it better when it was split screen, its also my personal preference. Id like you to change that please"
What a garbage. 2 hours after I installed this app it asked me 2 times to make a biometric video. Then it banned my account for suspicious activity I had 2 followers 3 following I deleted this app and WhatsApp and Facebook. Never felt this much scared in cyber world. They gathering ans using all your data. When they done and they know you awake and noticed they will ban you
"Horrible, used to be unique but has become a copy-cat shopping app. I\'ve had instagram for nearly 10 years now. It used to be my favorite form of social media because it genuinely allowed you to see what you WANTED to see: pictures and vids from your friends/family, with a few from prominent figures/influencers/celebrities you choose to follow thrown in there. It was its own thing and I loved it. Now its nothing but ad after ad, influencers I don\'t know or care about, and reposts of tiktok screen recordings that are posted as \reels\. And what is with this shopping tab??? Who has ever once thought \I love using instagram for SHOPPING\. Like huh?? What are the app developers thinking? I find that I actually engage much LESS with this app than I did just a few years ago, just because instagram and facebook are so of touch with what people like and want nothing but to inflate ad and data collecting revenue. The new layout and algorithm are confusing and not user friendly at all. I\'m sick and tired of it. I will be relegating this app to the app library until they figure it out and check in every once in a while to see if they\'ve dug themselves out of this awful hole they put themselves in"
DISAPPOINTED. Instagram reveals your personal detailsNot safe for children at allDoesnt take action of account that is reported No privacy Has no freedom of opinions
"Unsatisfied and annoyed. Ive reported so many posts and accounts that have encouraged hate and violence against one group of people. But Instagram never did anything about it. They said it doesnt go against their guidelines. So if theres flags and videos saying death to one group of people its not against their guidelines. I tried so hard to find a way to delete my account so I wont be a member of Instagram anymore due to their rules and monitoring which is none, but was unsuccessful as theres no option to permanently delete an account. They want full ownership of my data and pictures. This is not legal"
"Worthless for business. Algorithms keeping me from posting on my very active business account Ever since FB took over its been junk I am a very active user and my actions are constantly blocked, causing me to have to waste data by having to uninstall and reinstall just to use my account But if I report an account for nudity which is a direct violation of terms you do nothing"
Rate. I loved Instagram but for some reason its not allowing me to view my profile. Every time I tap to go to my personal page it goes to a black screen. My phone is up to date also 
"Please Dont Make This A Video Sharing App. I have used IG since 2013 and some updates are good and some terrible.  What I love is able to see and share photos. I love the save feature because I treat it almost like a Pinterest in that aspect. However, my fear is IG is trying to compete so much with TikTok that we will lose the PHOTO sharing aspect. Quit pushing reels and videos. I hardly see even a third of who I follow due to the algorithm. Make things chronological again  Also, I have no desire to intertwine Facebook and IG, I personally have a few IG Accts used for personal and business and I dont want my FB friends involved in any of that. Please dont ruin Instagram for the love of money, cuz after all I am sure thats why it keeps get worse for us, somehow it makes you guys more money"
Be aware users. Its been more than two month and Instagram did not give me my account back even when its linked to my Facebook account and sending me confirmation email about verifying my identity. I dont have access to the old email and phone number where they have been sending my code. This is insane that they just play with peoples private information like this and never even work on solving the issue. More than 12 years of memory gone for their stupid help Center that doesnt even work properly
"Brutal Support. Instagram seems to be getting worse over the years Updates are lame. Customer service is horrendous and honestly, non-existent. Good luck if you get hacked. Support is pointless - you report things and they do absolutely nothing about it. The amount of spam and bots are incredible. The structure filter has been broken for certain users for over TWO MONTHS and they have done nothing about it. Over this app on principle alone"
"Infuriating. Using this app is infuriating. Bad enough I have to deal with adverts and seeing how Instagram is spying on my online activity, I now have to deal with useless follow suggestions their useless algorithms suggest. Leave us alone and let us follow who we choose to follow"
Great concept less advertisement. This app is great in staying connected with friends and finding pages that interest you The new layout sucks its too focused on insta tv and reduces the personal connection you have to your friends
"Awesome. Its great It give you a choice if you dont them to access photos, or just selected ones by you. It respects privacy. It remembers the posts you liked and has recommended reels for you to watch based on what you like to watch. Get it It really is awesome If you want to post but you dont want random people to follow you, you can make your account private, for your followers only. Really, GET THIS APP"
"I dont even write reviews. I cant even change my profile picture, app is starting to get bugged out literally instagram is all in my close friends post over old photos that doesnt contain any nudity, turning int a controlling app when it comes to what you comment also and Ive gotten hacked by someone in Nigeria..makes me want to join another platform"
"Listen up. Instagram is great for texting friends if they dont have snapchat or messages. Ive had instagram for 4 months and 4 weeks its a fan page, but when I made a personal account it got updated with the messages and my fan page didnt so Id like you to update it for me"
Not too happy about Facebook ecosystem. Or google just break up the industry and stop selling info to cops and censoring Palestinians
"New Feed Update. I have used Instagram for about 5 years now and love all the features on it. However the recent change to add suggested posts on my normal feed isnt a feature I like or enjoy. I purposefully dont follow celebrities or other accounts on my personal insta, I prefer to just view my friends posts. I think this is something you should consider removing from the app as the original feed was great and didnt need an improvement"
"please leave instagram alone. i want to preface with i dont write reviews for apps unless it is so bad and i have nowhere to voice my frustrations besides the equivalent of your wallet.instagram was probably my most used app consistently for the past 5+ years. the latest update is atrocious. no, it is horrendous. actually i dont know what word would do justice for how bad the app is now. i cant access my messages 85% of the time. i cant share posts to my story 90% of the time. the change of putting notifications up top? mindless, i dont use the bottom portion of my screen unless im going home or to my profile(s). i dont care for reels, or shopping or igtv. quite frankly yall fcked this app up and im constantly asking myself why i continue to use it. i dont want facebook in a different form. i want a place i can connect with people i love and actually know. the money centric culture shift is pushing so many from an app centered around simplicity. get back to the roots. (facebook please sell instagram, ive been miserable since youve bought it)"
"Please Read. I really dont have anything against the app itself I guess, alright lets get to the point, I am 13 years old and I love to sing and act, therefore I put my account on public so people could enjoy my music, without going into too much detail, I was contacted by a predator asking and attempting to get/send pics, also for personal information. I blocked him and told my parents who then contacted the police yet they could not really do anything, so we tried reporting the man and contacting Instagram and they did nothing about it. So please just be careful"
"Make followers and following private. Instagram is the best Ive had it since 2017 and its been the best, but can you add one thing and its to add a privacy setting to where other people cant see the people that are following you or if your some other people them, its just people have been stalking recently and its weird because they would just go on your Instagram account and see who you follow and dont follow it creeps me out and I was just wondering if yall can add a privacy setting for it. It would make it better for it and so people wont have to do that anymore"
"Response ;. Id like to be able to see information on the person Im interacting with , it could be anyone , not safe"
Info. False information being spread
"No Privacy. December 04, 2021 review:Its almost 2022 and Instagram STILL does not allow you to hide who youre following from the people that follow you This is a feature that has been available on Facebook for YEARS Seeing how Facebook has owned Instagram since 2012, I assumed this important privacy feature would have been added by now. There is no valid reason for Instagram to not have the option of not allowing your followers to see the accounts you follow. People dont want everyone to see the account they follow for multiple privacy reason. This is especially important for female users Please update Instagram so you can hide who youre following for all followers or at least certain followers, thank you"
"Its gotten worse. Ive been using Instagram for year but lately it has gotten bad. This app barely loads and always says I have no WiFi when I do , and even when Im using my data. I feel like why update has made it worse"
"Great but not as great as it once was. Instagram is a great app if you use it in a healthy way, I think the algorithm is a little funky and we only get recommended b*tches with big bootys memes and other kinda internet poop media so dont let zuccy over here use your data for that bag"
DATA. HEY Instagram why every time I try to edit my Instagram profile it tells me (sorry we couldnt update your profile picture please confirm you have WiFi connection) I HAVE DATA not WiFi and this has been going on for MONTHS Ive noticed many people also have this problem please fix this
"Data collection without your knowledge. These shady folks collect your data and sell it to advertising companies, who in turn could be seling it to the heavens know who, who could be seling to someone else. In the meanwhile, you have no control in-app whether or not you can delete your account, and they dont send you a good link to reset your password. Next problem, I have heard stories of people getting their identities hacked repeatedly due to social media like this and oddly, it stopped after they deleted their accounts. So, to recap, they find where you live, using your IP address, take everyones data, sells it, and, as Google now owns them, could be selling it to China or other communist nations who take your data and use your account as a puppet. Whats worse, you have no control over the data. So they sell you freely for money. That whistleblower was a long time coming but the fact that we havent heard an uproar has me suspicious that nothing was really done about this. And it was bigger than she said. The password recovery was broken and I am unable to delete my account. I suspect its just a means to keep you there. In addition, as soon as I DO get access to my account and input the password and username using a keychain, it loops me right back to the login, effectively preventing me from deleting my account. This app is a trap, dont get it unless you want to slog through half of your weekend trying to just delete your account so you can stop getting hacked"
"Permanently deleted my account w/o explanation. I used this app for five years until one day it randomly popped up with a notice saying it needed to confirm o wasnt a bot. It texted me a confirmation code which I provided and it stated that it would review my account within the next 24 hours. The next day when I checked my account I was shocked to see that my account had been permanently deleted for not following terms of use. No other explanation. Just a link to their terms of use, none of which have I ever come close to violating. I am sick over all the lost photos and my personal contacts. And upset that such an extreme action would be taken by Instagram without so much as a warning or explanation for what led to their decision"
"Instagram. I really love Instagram Ive had it for 7 years. But I cant even use my personal account It will only let me post a photo on my page. I cant comment, like or interact with others pages. And Ive contacted Instagram help and Ive received nothing in return"
"Used to love IG, but a lot of bad changes. 1. Main timeline is supposed to be a TIMEline, meaning things are supposed to be in chronological order. The new suggestions I get now are not what Im interested in. Thats what the explore page is for2. The new algorithm has really hit personal accounts hard. This almost feels like some sort of money grab where Instagram only favors creators and influencers who try to promote and sell products by pushing them onto the timeline more. I just want my followers, friends and people I KNOW to be able to see my posts and engage with it like before but there has been a DRASTIC dropalmost laughable if I were to be honest"
"Monopolistic garbage. The only reason instagram still had a big user base is due to network effects.The fact that you cant schedule posts, a very basic feature, is absurd, and the fact that only business users (not personal users nor creators) can auto post with third party apps is ridiculous. Its as if it didnt occur to instagram that users who have accounts for pleasure or for fun would want control of when or how they post. And theres no justification why creators cant auto post. I had resisted instagram for a while, but had decided to create a hobby page on instagram. But I was so incredibly frustrated by trying to get third party app to schedule posts (I had to set my account to a business account, create a Facebook account, Facebook then blocked my account for no reason), that I had to drop the project altogether.The app is so user unfriendly that Im amazed it still has a user base. Its clear as time passes, more and more young people will select other apps, as instagram intentionally makes its app user unfriendly. It makes me think that Meta needs to think long and hard about their strategy, as alienating potential users is not going to help the fact that theyre struggling to increase their user base"
"Turned into AD Revenue Machine. Hate the latest update, turned my personal feed into something I barely even recognize anymore. Everytime you refresh it shows recommended post that are essentially post off the explore page. Its invasive. The activity page got completely whipped out and replaced by Instagram shop. Just trying to keep you engaged in content that creates profit for their pockets. The road Instagram is heading down a road where people would just be forced to leave"
"Feed. Im definitely not going to take this update; thanks to those who explained that the explore topics takes over the personal feed of friends and followed account posts. I refuse to update to IG and have it turn into a mash up of Facebook which I dont use anymore. The ads are bad enough, I skip over them or hide 85% of them. When will these social apps learn to leave well enough alone. As it is, without the update ruining my personal follows I give it 3 stars for the increasing amount of ads almost every 3rd or 4th item in my feed is not anyone I follow but some slammed in ad which I&#39;ll continue to ignore"
"Excellent Social Platform. I love Instagram it allows me to post  reviews, personal pictures, short videos.  Just a great place to find things Giveaways, contests etc .  You meet people from all over the world while building a name for your self or your business etc"
"Amazing potential, not so amazing use of potential. Before complaining I want to start by saying that Instagram is a great app with wonderful design and easy to work with. This app has a lot of potential, for businesses to sell their products, for entrepreneurs to show the world what they have to offer, and for artists to get commissions and get in touch with bigger companies; however, as high as the potential of this app is, the algorithm ruins everything Its not ideal for new businesses because they dont get much visibility in the app and the people who see their page even with promotions are usually not the people it is meant for Its not ideal for entrepreneurs because they are many fake accounts on Instagram that have broke the trust of users by constantly spam messages them about their products and promoting other fake accounts And this app is the least ideal app for artists The algorithm of Instagram demands you to be active and post at least 3 times a week if you want to end up on the main page, as we all know, thats not at all an ideal case for artists as it takes them a long time to finish artworks and then post, only to be disappointed by the under appreciation of Instagram that has shadow banned their work The app has recently announced that their main focus will now be on reels rather than posts and thats very frustrating because this feature is still very underdeveloped on this app, many people dont even have access to it yet Unless you are a meme page or a thread page posting every day, or unless you are using this app for a personal account, this app is very far away from ideal for you. Another issue with this app is the action restricted feature which you never encounter on apps such as TikTok, this features puts a limitation on the number of posts you can like or comment on Its not ideal for anyone really, for public accounts interacting with others is the only way of promoting themselves, and for personal accounts, it prevents you from being able to scroll for longWith the new issues Instagram has been having over the past few days, and all of these issues added to it, many accounts might consider switching to other platforms as a way of securing their accounts. Again I would like to emphasize that this app has a lot of potential and lots of great features, however almost everything on this app is underdeveloped.I am not fully sure how you can fix all these issues but many accounts are frustratedThank you for your time, hope you respond and fix these issues"
Good app but needs improvement. I love using Instagram. Only thing I wish insta would have is more privacy feature like if we want to hide our post from specific people like Facebook have those features. Then I would definitely give Instagram 5 star
FIX HACKERS INSTAGRAM. Instagram needs to be more worried about their customers information. Im not sure why everyones account is getting hacked but they need to fix that
Security. Ive had my Instagram since high school and since high school Ive had multiple phone numbers and emails. Instagram kicked me out and is now asking me for security info which I NO LONGER HAVE  because I dont have the same number anymore and or the same email So Instagram please explain to me how am I supposed to log back in when I dont have either of those 2 anymore ??? Work better on your security please
"Buggy and terrible. I have literally sent at least 100 reports to Instagram using their in app feature to report a bug and yet nothing has been done. I cant share those shareable story stickers anymore like I use to. Everyone else can do it just fine. Someone posts the story sticker with a question or something, you tap on it, and then you share it to your story. It worked about 4 months ago and then it eat randomly taken away and nothing at all has been done to fix it. Every time I pass a story sticker I cant share I shake my phone and send an error report with a screenshot and again Ive done this about 100 time and still NOTHING. Not even a response back. And thats not all, any time I make a question sticker on my story and people leave answers, I can answer them but once I post the answer my entire app freezes and I cant do anything but force close it. This started happening around the same time. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app and Ive updated it all the way and I updated my phone all the way and turned it off and back on and all that good stuff. Its still not working. This app is so annoying bc it listens in using your mic without asking just to give you targeted ads. It looks through your camera without asking to give you target ads. And yet it cant even get its stupid features right when you want to use them. Facebook is awful and theyre making Instagram just as unusable and also literally just using the app to spy on you to give you targeted advertising which Im pretty sure is illegal"
"User beware. I would like to start by saying I&#39;ve been using Instagram for 7 years now and it has been by far my favorite social media platform - that is, until a few days ago. I went to open my Instagram (an account that I have had for 7 years) and there was a pop up asking me to confirm my information. I did that, and then it brought me to a page that stated the following: Thanks for providing your information. Well review your information and if we can confirm it, youll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours. So I waited 24 hours, and then a couple days, and now its been well enough time and still, every time I try to log in, it gives me that same screen. As most of you probably know, there is no way to contact Instagram, which makes this problem so much more frustrating. I have gained a following and have tens of thousands of data that I desperately dont want to lose. I began doing some research and realized that I am not the only one dealing with this problem. No one else can seem to figure out how to fix it. Its not completely disabled so Im not able to appeal, but I still cannot access my account, and I fear Ive lost it forever. Although theres no way to contact Instagram directly I still used another account to report a problem and let them know what happened and begged them to help me out or even just contact me and let me know what happened. This review is a last attempt at getting someone to help me get my account back and if it doesnt work, that really says a lot about how much Instagram cares about their users and how quickly they will take your account from you. User beware"
"Everything about this app & company is utter trash. This app is utter trash, for so many reasons. Literally every 2-3 posts in the feed is a fricking ad, posts from people youre following are not put in chronological order & theres not even an option for it, the garbage algorithm will sometimes put the same post in your feed multiple times, theres no notifications for DMs/requests so its really easy to miss messages for months at a time, & onto of all that, this app harvests your personal info & is constantly recording video/audio of you when your using it"
"New update will have total access to your phone. Delete the app right now. The data terms of service talk of using your camera to see your facial reactions, your camera roll, ect. Anyhting youve said will be used against you in law on any app if you still have this downloaded"
Data. Why does this app use so much cellular data???  Otherwise its great
"With regards, someone having the least bit of humanity. Regularly user of instagram. In the light of recent events surrounding Palestine and Israel, the way instagram is blocking and deleting out posts and selling our information to Israel is just unacceptable You do not even deserve one star but thats the least this review goes to"
It keeps saying no internet connection. Im so annoyed because instagram will not work outside of Wi-Fi for me Im not sure whats wrong with the app but EVERYTHING on my phone works with data besides instagram and it did the same thing on my old phone before I just got a new one today
Really good. It is okay but shares personal information install it but be careful sooooooooo. Any people say that you can get hacked but no have fun on instagram
"Hate new shopping focus. Look, I know social media is just a front for selling us things we dont need and profiting off our data, but at least let me pretend that its supposed to be about connecting with people. I hate the new layout putting the shops tab where the notifications used to be.  Put people and connection back front and center"
"Community Standards. I posted a picture of my fireplace. Instagram refused to post it saying it violated their community standards. I wrote, Ooh baby its cold out there. Stay warm. How that violates your community standards is beyond me"
"problems. helloI have been using instagram probably since like 2014, and the following updates and services are quite frankly inappropriate. not only is the users privacy being invaded but also exploded for cash. I understand the need to share information with other companies to sell goods to the user but the  need to leave the users camera on when the app isnt even being used? I mean come on not cool mark.That doesnt even include how ugly the new update is. youve trained our fingers to go to one spot for notifications and then ya switch it out with??? SHOPPING?? If these things continue, I a loyal user will leave the platform"
"Allows Child Exploitation. The app keeps up and refuses to remove pages that post provocative pictures of children and teens, plus there are accounts that say right on their page that they sell child pornography. Funny how they take down the accounts that expose those accounts for bullying, harassment, and nudity. Pathetic"
"Instagram is the worst app. Do not download this app unless you want all of your photos easily hacked, and have your identity taken, then have ZERO support from Instagram to get your account back. Its actually unbelievable that a billion dollar company has ZERO support. Once the hacker easily gets ahold of your account they contact all your followers saying YOU need URGENT help from them, and of course your family and friends want to help you... so thats how they continue hacking accounts. Shame on you Instagram. Also it made me give 1 star to post this.... its actually -1000 stars"
Instagram. Instagram is one of the best apps I have downloaded on my iPhone tbh . I use it to share and post things I love or interested in . Also to connect with family and friends . Its a incredible app . Highly recommended 
"Privacy update. We need more privacy update about the followers and followed,Thanks for your concern"
"It only gets worse with time. Id give 0 stars if I could.This platform is brainwashing society by skewing reality through biased promotion and censorship of information being shared by its users. It should really concern the public that these monopolized online platforms have the power to commit such offenses. Ive noticed more and more hate-fueled content by the year, and its extremely disheartening. Not only are they keeping tabs on our personal info and lives, but they are manipulating users by withholding information through controlled algorithms based on the content they do not want us educated on. Do yourselves a favor and ask more questions, research global issues as independently as possible while weighing out the differences and similarities of various medias to eliminate biases, and protect yourselves and future generations from this corruption that will continue to take place and only get worse.These marketing scientists make social media addicting for themselves, not for you. Just remember that. We were made to do more than stare at screens and soak up toxic misinformation and wasteful content all day. They will keep you ignorant as long as they can, especially when they are making profits from it"
"Improvements. Yall need to fix the stories because some peoples stories keep popping up as if I never looked at them. Whatever formula Twitter used to get rid of horny bots is what yall need to use because I havent seen them on Twitter in months. Yall just kept letting these bots evolve for nearly two years, and its getting out of hand. I would like it if the sound wasnt automatically on every time I enter the app and was off like I always have it before I exit the app. Yall should let us post stuff at whatever size we want or at least make the frame a couple inches bigger because zooming out pictures for a full size still isnt enough. You guys should let us turn off notifications in-app. I already turned off the notifications for my phone, but Im getting annoyed with some people who like to go live a lot in one day and constantly having to see notifications for them popping up. I dont wanna unfollow them since I like their content, but ugghhh. Facebook gives public pages the option to invite people to their page. I think to crack down on people who follow others just because they want their following to go up should be to have them invite people to their page so that they dont piss people off who dont like it when someone constantly follows and unfollows them just because they want their following number to go up. So now, yall changed the layout of where the shopping center and notifications go.... Stop fixing whats not broken. Yall stay changing anything but what people really want you to change. Zuckerburg needs to focus on continuing to eff up Facebook because everything was good before Instagram was owned by Facebook."
"Get with the times. Instagram really fell off. It was cool and whatever, even when you stole Snapchats stories. But now, yall are boring. Not only did you let Facebook (the data selling pigs) pen you, now you havent given us anything new or fun besides that stupid shop tab that nobody asked for or uses. Get it together"
"Getting worse. Instagram used to be a a great app you could actually see what your friends posted, it was a more private social media, but now they redesigned the app and its horrible, they just want you to be more addicted by putting the reels and buy option first. Now you. Cannot access yo post a picture easily or to see your likes. And when your scrolling to see your friends pictures in your feed it lets you see like 12 and then it goes to suggestions. Things that you dont even want to look at. I just dont like it anymore I wish they had stay with the old design instead of trying to put Facebook ideas on Instagram"
"propaganda. Brutal censorship and brainwashing. This app attempts to apply subversion tactics on all users to support the destruction of the working class. It also is extremely invasive on your privacy. Say any word ten times in a row and soon you will get an ad for it on IG. If you can get around that, theres some cool memes and friends around. Better to just call them on the phone and go hang out in person though. Dont forget to join the experiment"
"new is not always better. The new settings are horrible  I have Instagram to see my FRIENDS pics and posts. Your algorithm should factor off of personal connections, not public accounts.  I have changed all my settings multiple times but I still cannot see family members posts on my feed.  FIX IT"
"Bring back video replay. For a few days, Instagram had this function where after you watched a video from an account, the next video from that account would play automatically. I loved this because I listen to Instagram videos while I drive and its dangerous to have to look at my phone to pick the next video to watch. When it plays automatically, I wouldnt have to worry about that. I have no idea why they took that feature away but I miss it. I only gave it 2 stars because I lost my first account due to defending myself from an account that posted my privateInfo. While that account is still up with my private info still on it ( its a public account too) mine was suspended for making fun of her nostrils. Get your priorities straight, Instagram"
"Microphone access requirement for pictures. You cant post a picture on stories without microphone requirement. Its a photo not a video, I dont need sound on my picture. Really makes question their privacy methods. Good thing for iOS 14 security updates focused on user privacy"
"Blocked with no answers or responses. Ill preface this by saying, normally I like Instagram and use it on a very regular basis, BUT two of my business accounts in the past week have been thrown to the wolves with no reason given and no responses, despite numerous requests, from Instagram. Blocked from Posting, Liking, Following, Tagging, Commenting or Hashtagging. We can post a Story, but with no Tagging or Hashtags. Its been 7days Insta. Hey Zuck, put a couple $Billion of your fortune into some Customer Service and get off your Apple is killin my business profits with Privacy throne... Just saying"
"Actually pretty good but. Would be nice if the parent company Facebook took privacy and fake news more seriously, so for that - 1 star"
"Censorship, shadow banning, sold us out. No privacy, yet controls what we say. Garbage"
??. Instagram i need help i have a problem  all my apps or working on my phone with my data but for some reason Instagram does not it keep saying no internet connection
Hate the update. Instagram is not listening to their users and keeps getting worse and worse. This is no longer a platform for personal content sharing. The only thing I see is ads. Nobody asked for reels or shopping. No point in using my account anymore
Some improvements. Insta needs few improvements in its privacy. If user has set privacy in his/her insta account but insta need to show whenever they are online same as WhatsApp has privacy settings. Its not showing last seen but it shows when user using it.And other recommendation in story and post user can able see when his/her follower and following seen their story like WhatsApp have.Please and thank you.Insta lover
"Only 2 stars. Reasons i like it:1. good way to connect with friends and see whats going on in each others lives2. fun to useReasons i dont like it: 1. BIG DEAL RN WITH BITCOIN HACKERS This app is great, but there are bitcoin hackers hacking into peoples accounts, acting as someone else and posting things they shouldnt be, for example my account was hacked and they posted a picture of me (from a previous post) but it was used as their lock screen and had a bitcoin add on it. They tried to make it look like i was the one who had posted it. They will hack into your account and change the password, phone number and email. You will not be able to get back in. INSTAGRAM HAS NO SUPPORT EMAIL OR NUMBER AVAILABLE I reported this account and they didnt do anything to fix it. I have the number of the user who hacked my account. Instagram if you see this please fix. Find the bitcoin hackers and remove them. 2. app is too complicated for those who struggle with technology. even hard for those who understand it. Too complex. instagram, if you fix these issues I will change my rating to 5 stars"
App performance. Use the app everyday only problem I have no matter if Im on data or WiFi it take a min to load usedTo be so fast No its not my phone just bought a new phone brand new so no its not my phone Annoying because honestly I love the app Facebook Snapchat google whatever loads instant but Instagram takes. Longer
Literally controlling the narrative. Unfortunately the lead of this Platform has used their personal interests to block content and freedom of speech on our PERSONAL ACCOUNTS. Such a shame we cant be ourselves in 2021
"CONSTANT mobile gaming ads. If Instagram is going to track my data and insist on advertising to me, why cant I at least have relevant advertising? Every second item in the feed is an ad for some juvenile mobile gaming app Hiding the ad as irrelevant does nothing - next ad is more of the same"
"Gross Ads. Been using for five years now and its been a trim version of Facebook. I didnt have to do as much editorial work to get away from the ads and political buffoonery - until now. While the political blast isnt on, the proliferation of ads and rewiring of the experience towards ads is gross. The last update highjacks your personal past feed for Suggested Posts. Guess what - theyre all ads. Half of which are clearly schemes, hype, or manipulations. Countdown to deletion is on"
"Lost my account with more than 6 years of photos. Ive been hacked And even if my Facebook account is link to my Instagram, they are not responding to my 10 try to get it backI have send a picture of me holding the numbers they send me and my license card as well, but never got my account back They say that Its not me...Im soooooo mad And 2 of my friends have lived through the same thing without being able to get their account back.I tough this app was reliable, NOT.Be safe friends...I now know that years of personal pictures are in strangers hands and its very scaryWorst customer service :/"
Help. My account was unfairly disabled. Instagram says it was in violation but does not specify what the violation is I was using a app to track my followers. Ive sent copy of my id. Pictures holding the validation code and still no response
Kimberly. I hate the fact the they hacked my account and Instagram is not doing nothing about it plus I had all my information
Amazing. Instagram is an amazing app. You can edit your videos and photos easily With a private account you can choose who follows you. With a public account everyone can see your photos and videos I recommend this app for people who are big on social media. You can wright a description on your account. Download this app for FREE
music? story?. im normally a lover of instagram..sorta. anyway. please make the option to let business accounts have music..i understand copyright and why. but MULTIPLE PERSONAL accounts use business so they can add a location. you dont get that option with personal or creator. and as ive heard you only get music with those options. please take it off or add a option to add a location to the bio for all account formats
Full of spam accounts and Instagram does not care. My account is private. My settings are set where I have to manually approve tags - but all that does is prevent them from showing on my profile. Yet tonight I followed a few celebrities and Ive been bombarded with tags in spam posts. Ive removed the tag and reported each post and it just continues to happen. Literally more than 15 posts in the past hour. Your app should be better than this garbage. IF MY ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE PEOPLE (bots) SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAG ME IN THEIR POSTS
Update is weak and privacy is nonexistent. F U Mark. Facebook is ruining this app. Mark Zuckerberg is a massive sellout doosher and the features on this update are horrible. No privacy. Facebook spies on everything you do even if you dont have a Facebook account. No one should have to mention a company they dont even use in a review for a totally different app yet here we are. Get Fd marky mark
"My friends Instagram account isnt showing ANYTHING. She is experiencing on her google pixel 3a a issue where she just cant load anything and its just white screen and doesnt show anything, and she has tried to delete the app and reinstall it, and she is to afraid of clearing data on it because she thinks its going to forever delete her account. What should she do?"
"Data mining, deleting accounts for no reason. You cant find this sh*# on google when you try to search why your account was deleting for no reason. Trying to log back in saying the username doesnt exists. Instagram has been on a downwards spiral ever since they were bought by Facebook. Now its curated ads, paid ambassadors, and news outlets curated to your liking. Absolutely terrible"
Login. Every time I delete and redownload Instagram it keeps my account on there and it doesnt log me out. I helped my friends mom make a new acc on my phone and now all her info is on my phone
Lack of privacy. I had to create a new page cause my original page was hacked and its sad you guys have no contact information and the directions to recover are useless.  You guys need to do better I lost plenty of work picture pertaining to my business as well moments over the years.  So hopefully the creators of this social media site will try and implement some form of hack ware or make it where you can retrieve your hacked account.  I doubt this review even gets a second thought by creators n staff but being a member for years and to experience this is ridiculous and makes me very uncomfortable to rate you any hire one star is actually being generous 0 stars would be better. Thx
"Worthless. No privacy, nor freedom, its almost all adds these days, not even worth the bother"
Wont stop stealing my data even after I turn off cellular network. Wont stop stealing my data even after I turn off cellular network it switch it right back on by itself am sure they figure a work around to this so they dont steal your info so blatantly
Instagram doesnt have customer service. I was hacked for over a week. Instagram has no phone number and no one monitoring the need help emails. The hackers have been conning ppl out of $ thanks to ig not helping.   Come up with better solutions for helping us instead of fact checking accurate information
"Beware NO Security. My acct was hacked & stolen @Instagram does nothing. Hackers have used my IG acct to call all my contacts asking for money trying to scam them from their accounts and banking info. They have even FaceTime called my followers, friends, & family with elaborate stories posing as me. I responded to the emails IG sent as the hacker was stealing my acct continued to report the acct as have my family of friends & followersNothing heard back after weeks except from those scammed or those who called me to ask if i was ok.No security on IG"
"Things need to change. The most recent update to come to Instagram which automatically installed on my phone on 11/13/20 is the most idiotic update to ever happen. Who ever had the moronic idea of replacing the add post button with a REELS BUTTON and the notification tab with a SHOPPING TAB needs to be fired IMMEDIATELY.  I cannot understand why the app known for posting picture and video media would make it less accessible to add posts and would rather replace it with off brand tik tok no one cares about.  The absolute cash grab of replacing notifications with shopping blows my mind. Why would I EVER go into Instagram to SHOP OF ALL THINGS rather than just see what my notifications are.  It makes so sense and its extremely user unfriendly. Then you delete negative comments about the update?  You messed up, fix it"
"Cool image based social network. As a late millennial who likes to have fun looking a cool images and videos, this is my preferred social network. You have the ability to easily create multiple accounts and easily switch between them. This is useful for me because I like to keep my personal account separate my secondary account, which I use as an outlet for creative expression, which may be offensive to some people"
"Whoever is in charge of updates needs to be fired. I honestly could care less about Instagram anymore. The recent updates have been awful. Look at your recent reviews. Theyre all giving you worse than I did, because of your terrible update ideas. I just came here today to tell you have annoying it is to go watch a video on someones feed and 10 secs in its asking me to, not continue watching the rest of the video, but to watch more reels. No. I want to watch the video I was watching. So when you click on it, it takes you to the video. But takes you all the way back to the beginning. And guess what? You can fast forward to where you wanted to anymore. You have to rewatch the video. Thanks Instagram: for selling out to the most awful company there is in Facebook Probably deleted my accounts soon"
"It reads your personal txt messages. Violates your privacy, will never use the app, only occasionally on the browser"
Keeping in touch . Such a fab way of connecting with everyone out there. Has encouraged me to notice things more and take a simple photo and share Great for personal use and fab for my small business 
Ridiculous. I had Instagram since 2017 and a lot of people had Instagram a long time ago people shouldn't be losing they accounts they worked hard for cause of these hackers y'all should be able to turn this app into a good app so no hackers could reach this app cause I'm not gonna lose all my hard work and followers just to make a new one and the ridiculous part about it is after the person gets hack and wants to recover their page we have to take of picture of our selves and I mostly feel like it's not fair cause not everyone has pictures or like posting pictures on their page unless it's highlights and y'all take so long for a feedback it makes no sense
"Not the same anymore. The new update is horrible, I cant see anything personal from my friends and family. Just clothes that I will never buy and random reels that dont interest me and I find annoying. Instagram is the worst social media platform now to me. I wish it can go back to when it was more personal where I didnt have to go out my way to just see four pictures that my friends post on the feed. And why change all the buttons?? Anyways horrible app lol"
No longer feels personal. Went from saying youre all caught up and then showing me the older posts to youre all caught up and me having to tap the option to see older posts or scroll down and be fed suggested posts. I want this to be optional. I no longer feel my feed is personalized to the things I want to see or even that my feed is specifically people I follow. Its gone from an occasional ad to a basic ad fest of heres what WE think you like but we dont know you at all and now you have to search for an old post if you wanna see it again because it isnt even on your feed now If this goes on for long Ill begin to search for another app that lets me control what I see
Strong arm tactics. Everything was fine. I was giving FB lots of analytics about my time and what I liked on IG.  Recently they wanted my birthday and I refused to put it in. Unless I put it in Im unable to scroll unendingly through reels. Bye Instagram. You cant force me to give you my bday info. Yall already have so much personally identifiable information
"Track Unfollowers. So far Ive had an okay experience with instagram, but it would be so much better if Instagram could track who unfollows me. Instead of having to download another app that is most likely just trying to steal my account"
"Horrible Support Team. I sent in a report a problem request three times with no feedback or resolution to my problem. In addition to the lack of support, the updated app version, that includes reels, and shopping in place of the posting features and comments section make the platform into a product promotion and shopping app, similar to Etsy, instead of a photo sharing app. Lastly, the Facebook marking schemes, and lack of privacy in regards to the targeted ads are unnerving. I got off Facebook only to find Instagram is roughly the same platform"
"My theory. In the future, the only thing left of us is data. This app is great for collecting are best moments, lets keep sharing to keep are memories alive. "
"Like it but. I like Instagram, but I wish you could make more then 5 accounts, and it would be great if it could use less data"
Stupid algorithms causing issues. I keep posting jib jab Valentines videos that I paid for that have permission to use certain songs and yet Instagram keeps deleting them for copyright.  I know its not personal but someone needs to either have the courtesy to respond or fix the algorithm
Privacy concern. If there was an option to give 0 start I wouldve. Instagrams new update allows no privacy to their users. They can watch their users through phone cameras without permission which is very disturbing and concerning Im sure they does many more things than just watching us. Do better Instagram
"someone has way too much time on their hands. whoever is in charge of ui changes needs to be moved to the department where they send your data to china or something else that doesnt affect how the app looks. it has become a weekly tradition of loathing and hatred when i open up instagram and see some overpaid pencil neck weasel moved the buttons somewhere that makes absolutely no sense. as of writing this the latest offense is moving the save button for a story to the bottom left. so now when i wanna post something on my story, i just end up taking a useless screenshot of it cause ive built up the muscle memory of the old system that couldve stayed the way it was for the rest of the apps existence. honestly instagram could be run by a few monkeys and a plastic play set microwave that tells you the food is hot and it would be a better experience. been on instagram pretty much since it came out and its so frustrating that they have the only usable app that fills the void of channel surfing"
"No Longer share to stories. Ive been using Instagram for years and never had issues with the feature where you share public post of other accounts to your stories. As someone always in the app, but rarely posting pictures, I use it as a means of communicating my interests, jokes and information to friends. Where I could do this since the feature first launched, it has now been a month since I have been able to do this at all. I assumed that it was a beta feature that was no longer in testing, or a privacy setting by select pages but now I see that my friends can share post that I simply dont have access to. If this is intentional, they need to notify their users as to why theyre limited. It is truly unfair"
"Salam alaykum dear insta . What you like me to write? This is a nice page and privacy is excellent, i dont know about security yet , its just there is difficulty for videos to  post or share , and not possible to copy and paste, and with any mistakes there is no way to back or edit  or complete delete, after all i love  insta thanks "
"Stop trying to turn it into fb. I havent had facebook since 2011. Started using instagram because it was just pictures, likes and comments making it a more creative outlet. However, facebook has just ruined this app the last few years. Im so sick of reels. The Ads are ridiculous and half of them are spam. Guess I will be deactivating this account too"
"Awful app. Instagrams new terms of use harm sex educators, sex workers, and anyone who cares about privacy protection, and will use them to continue its discrimination against disabled, fat, nonwhite, femme, trans, and otherwise marginalized bodies"
"App doesnt work. The app always tells me that my account is restricted, and that I have compromised the guidelines when I have not.However when I log in through a search engine it works perfectly fine. This started last week when my account got banned for a few days for phishing which I never did. I have never granted access to any third parties, so far as to check on my account, which states that I have NEVER granted access to any, so why does Instagram keep telling me I have. I then have to change my password, just in case my account has been compromised or I have been hacked. It was fine for a few days, but now i cant like or comment on posts through the app due to restricted activity in order to protect the community. I googled it, and it said that this happened when you attempt to use bots, which again, I havent done. I am so frustrated with the lack of support on the Instagram help website. I have no idea how to fix this issue, and why this issue is even happening. I can not find a way to work around it, unless I log into Instagram through a search engine. I have the app updated to the lasted update, and I have even tried logging in and out of my account. Notbing is working and my account is still being banned from doing stuff for no apparent reason. I have not gone against the guidelines of Instagram at any point in my whole time using it, and I certainly have not used a bot of any sort to gain likes. Please fix this problem, because it is very frustrating and upsetting. I feel as if I am being personally attacked for no apparent reason"
"Infuriating to use, made for infants and people without brains. All this app wants to do is shove content down our throats. It moved the POST button AND notifications button AWAY and shoved in the corner to promote brainless endless videos to scroll through, and SHOPPING? Who please tell me WHO wanted this?? Not a single person Ive ever met on planet earth said yes instagram should be a shopping platform and yet here we are replacing the giant notifications button with a shopping icon? I have not ONCE tapped this icon nor will I ever use it. You keep pushing these garbage ideas and praying it will stick. And for YEARS my accounts have had endless issues with features only being available on one account, hashtags not working, or accounts outright being shadow banned, which is very clear when it takes years to gain followers, then magically one day I start gaining them again. Funny how that works. Not to mention the reels content giving me filter ads to shove the most brainless FiLtErS down my throat to make me use them. I guarantee youre just gathering face data to spy on people. This app is garbage, and ran by scum. I genuinely hope you see this and wonder why. The only reason people are giving positive reviews are so people can see them. You and Apple only promote positive reviews, I havent seen ONE that promotes the truth and scum behind mEtA Cant wait for the downfall of your corporation"
"It makes too many mistakes. Instagram has become very annoying lately. For example, I got on the app today and it told me I was blocked from liking any pictures because I have an app that helps me get followers. For starters, I have no apps on my phone to help me get followers. And if you report the problem itll take them forever to fix it. This is an app that they made, so they should be very quick if one of their customers is unhappy with its service. Instagram, please stop accusing people of using apps and then denying them the access to do what the app was made for. And when someone reports that this was a mistake, make sure you work diligently to fix it"
Stealing information. Update every week for nothing other than to steal my information. THANKS
"ALL YOUR INFO. Obviously, by now everyone knows we are all being tracked by these apps and ALL of their 3rd party apps I MEAN ALL OF YOUR INFO-right down to your exact location at all times Before, for years it was just obscure-we could sweep it under the rug. NOW, they are telling YOU EXACTLY the truth about what was once hidden. There is no privacy left, and I guess they think their apps are so worth it bc sooner or later, you&#39;ll be bated-we all are.  This is what will be handed to our grand-kids and great-grandkids forevermore?"
Updates Nov 2020. These new updates since FB took over are bleh. Not a fan. Miss the old Instagram for sure. Also tech supports way worse off than before. Response times for personal accounts are super slow lately. I guess the accounts that make them money are priority and I get it but not thissss long
"A good Idea. Instagram should bring privacy for each post so if the proglgile is public, so users can set some photos or posts to only be visible by like the circle of close friends only rather than public"
Works for me. Instagram is cool on a personal or business side. Its easy but they pay so much attention to detail
Insta review. App is horrible. Spurs in you. Send recordings data to quora. App allows Instagram to better limit your organic reach. Horrible app will cause iPhone to slow down. Youll regret it
"Useless updates, capitalist hellscape, garbage use experience. The past Instagram updates have turned Instagram from an enjoyable image sharing experience into a money grubbing, data harvesting, attention monopolizing shopping app. I hate what it has become. Please listen to your users, stop fiendishly pursuing profit at any cost and create a product that people actually want to use. Also Tik Tok is better than reels; nobody asked for reels"
"Whoever is in charge of updates needs to be fired. I honestly could care less about Instagram anymore. The recent updates have been awful. Look at your recent reviews. Theyre all giving you worse than I did, because of your terrible update ideas. I just came here today to tell you have annoying it is to go watch a video on someones feed and 10 secs in its asking me to, not continue watching the rest of the video, but to watch more reels.

You can fast forward to where you wanted to anymore. You have to rewatch the video. Thanks Instagram: for selling out to the most awful company there is in Facebook Probably deleted my accounts soon.Stop the updates"
Approve. I love this app because when I got hacked they allowed me to get my page back unlike Facebook I know they are a shared company but Instagram helped me when it happened an stopped the hacker from using my page unlike Facebook
Hackers. Honestly need to say how hard it is to have them review your reports someone hacked into my Instagram and has had my account for over 24 hrs and is posting scams to hack others please improve on this matter as soon as possible. People should not be able to steal someones identity and post and control their account on their behalf
Not loading. I like instagram a lot. But lately it wont load on WiFi or of WiFi when using data
Personal review. Instagram allows me to make contact worldwide with new found friends. I rate it 5 stars. 
Internet Issue. My instagram is not working ( saying i have no internet connection) when i got my Cellular Data on. Ive never seen this issue with anyone else . This is really upsetting
Dosent work with Lte. Why dose Instagram not work with data and only WiFi it makes no sense please look into it of fix it
"instagram. duh. u get logged out all the time. no matter how strong your password is, u get hacked. if u cant access ur email or phone number that you created the account with, u cant get it back. at least they hated me enough to not give me mine back. i cant ever get it back so i always have to make a new account and my friends hate me for it. im so tired of trying to get my account back but i want to stay up to date with all my friends. i have a hate love relationship with this stupid app"
Worst customer support. I have been hacked and tried everything to get my account back or banned because they are using to scam people. Instagram support is useless. I made a police report and a FBI report against the hackers to see if anyone could help me. I do not understand how someone can just get in to my account change every information and get away with it while instagram protects them so well but didnt protect me against them. After resolving this issue I will never be using instagram again
"Garbage app...gelded platform. Instagram will never improve nor be implemented appropriately as long as the fanboys keep IGs arrogance fed. Nobody at Instagram actually uses their app so could care less how shytti it performs. The touch/swipe is too sensitive and takes you off your intended page - only to have to start again with scrolling back to where you were. Terrible implementation. The fake tools/options to opt out of seeing the bottom feeders posts is an insult and meant to piss is off. It certainly doesnt lead to targeted ads being effective. And the ads make NO SENSE whatsoever Yes, IG is getting paid but the ad support they have is based off of bogus mining and reporting. And why cant I search blocked people? And why cant I delete BIO data? And whats the motivation to list BIO data? And why are we forced into 4:5 boxes when almost all cameras do 16:9, 4:3, 3:2? Contentious slags. And why cripple the API so better apps, like Flume, can help make the IG experience far less excruciating? Arrogance keeps this site/app crap. And now Facebooks millennial failures will undoubtedly seal the deal and keep IG lacking an appealing user interface and supportive environment"
Fashion update / daily update on news of your personal interest. One single page in which you have all news of your personal interest . Is actually a most relevant app of our time
"Im never getting any of the new features. So lately Ive noticed anytime new features come out such as being able to share posts to your story, adding music to your story, the purple messages, etc. MY ACCOUNT HAS YET TO GET THEM. I get thats there are beta accounts but I HATE that its been nearly 2 years since some of these features have been released and I still dont have them. I have them on my business account, but not for my personal account (which is where I prefer to have those features). Hmm I wonder why??? Is there some sort of tag on my account that Instagram has to prevent me from enjoying the app to its fullest? Im getting sick and tired of it"
"Cant send links on DM. Another useless change and now I cant send links in DM to my friends, something to do with privacy smh. What privacy? Im sharing blog articles with my friends, what does that have to do with privacy??"
"Needs more work. I am actually sad to give them one star, Instagram is a wonderful platform to meet people and share however my account that Ive had for many years was hacked into and deleted without my knowledge until I could not login. Ive reached out to them so many times for help and at one point I got a response but no follow up responses from them regarding the issue Ive begged them to fix. All my years and personal growth is down the drain. Instagram should update/fix how they handle accounts being hacked and or deleted. FB gives 30 days to reactivate a deleted account before its removed completely, maybe Instagram should consider something similar or more verification before deleting/ allowing an account to be deleted. They also need a stronger help center with a better follow up system regarding situations such as these"
"Ad Bombardment . Ads have recently diminished the experience of social interaction. Im seeing more ads than my own personal feed. Instagram, DO BETTER"
"9-26-21 update is renders app worthless. Im literally on this app to connect with my friends and family. Not a bunch of strangers I couldnt care any less about. This *brilliant* update that dropped, apparently 3 days ago, is designed to make it *nearly* impossible to navigate to see posts from those you actually follow. I get nothing but account follow suggestions when I open the app. Once you start scrolling, you can tap on posts or older posts to see actual posts you follow. But wait Theres more Haha, the catch is there is now 2 sponsored posts and an advertisement (or vice versa) for EVERY post you actually want to see. The ads and sponsored content that is currently on the app with this last update has made it pointless. BUT WAIT Theres MORE They alternate it in such a way you have no choice but to see all the ads to know if its friend or foe. What really gets my goat is that now Im going to have to teach my 75+ parents how to use a different app because this one isnt that same as 3 days ago. Its completely changed. So, why not literally move them to a different app? Thanks, Instagram, for cutting my family off from each other during a global pandemic instead of making it easy for us to connect. Aka, leaving it how it was when it served the intended purpose, or providing real, actual customer feature updates that still served the intended purpose. You harvest our information to sell to make your money. At least give us the product we are literally paying you (via our personal information that you are making a killing off of) for"
Nothing done to be able to limit photo access. Hello insta Im so unhappy about the way you handled iOS 14 new photo privacy. You did nothing to allow users to be able to limit our photo access within the app. Why??? Is that to hard for you guys at insta??  So what? Have to give access to all photos because your UX is bad???? Lots of apps did a great job Check it out
"what are you doing?. Ive been using the app since 2013 and I never really had any issues until recent updates that just dont make sense to me. The shopping option at the bottom is annoying by its self, but taking out the option to share peoples or your own post on your story??? what was that for?Also the feed has been a MESS for months now and scrolling upon pictures of people you follow is getting harder everyday. Instagram is not a fun app anymore. Its focusing on sells for I guess big companies, because the game isnt even fair for entrepreneurs.Its a matter of time before people leave for an app that doesnt play with us and actually lets us communicate"
"Pathetic. I dont know what is going on but this app has started to go downhill and it hasnt stopped. I normally dont take notice to or care about issues, bugs or dumb decisions when it comes to apps but the series of events that unfolded recently shocked me and it is genuinely the worst experience Ive had with any app. Not too long ago around Christmas Day I believe I attempted to open my Instagram but I am faced with the surprise that my Instagram has been disabled, why you may ask, what did I do you may ask at the time I had no clue because you arent even told what you did. I thought to myself okay thats fine I dont recall doing anything wrong Ill check to see if I can appeal. But guess what? I have to verify my phone number, okay no problem I click to get the code, nothing, I try again, nothing, I try 20+ times nothing. I think to myself Ill wait a day or two. A day later I try, nothing, I try another few times, you guessed it nothing. So I go to the customer service to see if there is any other way to get into touch about my problem. It seems unlike every other app Ive ever had to use customer service for, you cant contact via email, nor is there an inbuilt area to contact on the website or app. I leave it for a few days thinking Ill just wait out the disablement but a few days later I think to myself what if it is disabled indefinitely. So I decide to try the phone verification again, you wont believe this, it finally works, however I now have to wait till 2 am until I can actually appeal. 2 am rolls by guess what? Cant appeal Im now made aware for some unknown reason Instagram has this request that not only is impractical but makes no sense. I have to take a photo of my face next to a piece of paper with my username and some code. Now my Instagram has no posts on it, no saved stories and my profile picture isnt me so again entirely impractical, not only in my case as at least half of the people I follow on Instagram dont have themselves on their profile either. So I respond questioning this request and if it is really necessary especially considering I have nothing on my profile that showing my face would suddenly prove its my account. Anyone who has a face could just do this process and get my account thats number one, number two any at all competent at photoshop could photoshop me next to a piece of paper with the required information if I did have myself on my account. But thats besides the point, the point is it makes no sense and is entirely impractical in fact Im confident a 14 year old would think of a better verification method. But thats not the best part yet, the best part is it has been a few weeks now since I responded to their request, no response from them, no sir it is a necessary part of our process please comply, no if you want your account back dont be difficult and do it absolutely nothing. I then decided you know what Ill just do the damn photo I dont care if thats what they absolutely find necessary then Ill do what they want. But guess what? When I attempted to start the process again not to respond to the same message that I had already responded to that got no return, I got no message asking for the photo of my face next to the paper so I tried again and again and again absolutely nothing. At this point Ive given up to be quite honest the only reason I tried to get my account back on an app that is clearly run impracticality in atleast a few areas is because everyone I know is on the app, if it wasnt for that simple fact I wouldve deleted the app long ago. But it looks like it has practically been done for me now, just felt like Id write this here even though there is probably no one working at Instagram that reads these but even so it can work as a word of warning to people of the dismal customer service this app provides and the dumb reasons your account can be disabled which I didnt mention why my account got disabled did I? Youre going to love this, my account got disabled because I followed people off of my recommended accounts list, and no I didnt refresh and do it a few times only once, and this is apparently bot like behaviour or whatever honestly I dont care enough to put any thought into how using a feature implemented in the app is bot like behaviour nor do I care enough to even attempt to comprehend why that is enough to disable my account especially since I used the feature once and I didnt even follow all the accounts it recommended but if thats not proof enough of the dismal logic at play here I dont know what is, oh and dont forget about the atrocious customer service, lots of love xoxoxo"
"Need more help?. My account has been hacked and need more help? Option is never available on any of my devices that I have used for this insta account. My insta account is ricky_bains_d1_vr6 I need help Instagram are not really helpful at all. Im in fear for my life as the hackers are posting me making £80,000 in a few hours and I live a bad neighbour hood. People around here are already plotting against me. How do I access the need more help? Option if it doesnt show"
Hey Zuckerberg you and your company can piss off. Hey Zuckerberg you and your company can piss off Your notion of privacy access is beyond ridiculous
Instagram Story. I am unable to use certain features on my business page Instagram Story that I am able to use on my personal page Instagram Story. I have googled this issue for months. Others have this same problem
"Free Palestine. Very vulnerable application, it collects private information about users and sell it for other countries, it has zero clarity with the users as well as they are deleting and banning hash tags supporting the controversy happening in Palestine Al-aqsa. I dont recommend using any application by Facebook because there are ao many accusations against them"
"Great Platform, Absolutely Terrible Security. Instagram has no customer service at all. I was a fool and managed to have my account stolen from me, and the countless efforts I tried to recover it were useless. I was mostly frustrated that there is no email or phone number to contact for help. Their recovery system seems to rely solely on technology, and in my experience it just doesnt work. I lost my account, and nobody existed to help get it back. If you get your account hacked, thats it. You lost it. Please be careful"
"More privacy please. Pls pls pls add an option to close the following and followers lists, it is kind of very private. I really wish instagram would add this option; the same experience we had with face book and it didnt hurt any one"
"Horrible system. This app has an automated system that tries to detect spam accounts and block them from taking any actions. Its against their community guidelines to use third party apps/websites that help you gain followers by automatically following, unfollowing, liking, and commenting for you. This is perfectly acceptable, but what is completely unacceptable is when Im trying to organically grow my own page WITHOUT the use of third party tools, and instagrams detection system thinks Im a bot. These action blocks are really getting in the way of not only expanding my brand, but also of my personal relationships with people I care about on social media"
More deception from Facebook corruption. Now the app notifies you of a notification when in fact you dont.  Facebook added that a suggestion is now considered a notification. Your notifications is full of garbage to follow junk. If Inwanted that I had a way before without corrupting notifications.Now that election is over Facebook still feels the need to push their personal political agenda and be my vaccine app since its not a voting app. Big piece of garbage. I am posting on vero to get away from the jerks at Facebook
Do not download unless you dont care about privacy. Absolutely zero privacy. Your calls and messages will be monitored and you will be bombarded with ads for things you mention
"If your account is hacked or hijacked you have zero recourse and Instagram will not take action. I know people whose accounts have been hacked, and they have tried every avenue available through a Instagrams help portal, and they were not able to recover their accounts and Instagram simply does not respond. The person who hacked your account will have access to all your DMs and contacts and they can change all your information and theres no way you can get it back. Everyone should immediately get out of this app because that is absolutely unacceptable, when it comes to actual problems and actual hacking which is a federal crime, a Instagram simply does nothing and theres no way to get a hold of a human being"
"sinking ship. with each update this app gets worse and worse. each time I tell myself it cant get worse than this and then it does. I hardly ever use it anymore. the algorithm is horrible for both personal and business accounts, its impossible to grow a business and you never get to see the posts you want. now they have shopping and reels which honestly defeats the purpose of the app in itself. not to mention seeing ads ever 3 or 4 posts. its clear instagram doesnt care about the users, only about making money. the only reason I still have the app is to talk to a couple people, otherwise I wouldve been off it years ago"
"This app is wonderful for people with hatred in their hearts. I got harassed for an opinion and was cyberbullied and got hurled personal insults for no reason, Im a man of discussion so its sad to see people act that way towards me like Ive done something wrong, I reported him for bullying because thats what he was doing was bullying me, and he suffered no consequence, youd think Instagram would be a place that doesnt tolerate hatred but I was wrong"
Insta is saying please check your internet but I have internet and data. Insta is saying please check your internet but I have internet and data it just wont let me on not even when I Google it the app and website wont work for me I even re installed it and I have 4 bars now
"Cross app messanging. Its a good app to use but I havent got the feature for the Facebook messenger, yes Ive updated it and yes Ive uninstalled and reinstalled it. I have checked my data in the security category but it says theres nothing to show there. I really do need this feature to talk to friends and family easily"
Trash. I downloaded an app to track my followers.. shortly after Instagram locked my account Because it thought I was trying to buy followers 
"They are scammers. Instagram app does not help you recover hacked profiles, Instagram period will allow your page to be hacked and your info given out and they will ignore all of your complaints and effort of reaching out to correct the situation"
"Latest Update is pointless and annoying. The latest update, once again, completely reorganized and changed how half of the app works, with the sole objective of tricking people into using the instagram shop or whatever.This is one of the main reasons i left facebook. If I start seeing advertisements to buy things on Instagram I am deleting this app immediately.Why cant you just let us have a fun space to interact while you leech money from our data? Who sees a functioning capitalist-centric platform and says, Ya know what, we could make this even more capitalistic and invasive. Nobody will mind that.UGHH"
"Oddly difficult to use. Oddly restrictive guidelines. First off, as a young adult Id say Im tech savvy, yet this app is confusing to use. Why? Please do better. Second, your guidelines say  We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities. So to criticize a PUBLIC figure, like a politician, by saying they are a coward for turning off their comments so they can ignore the criticism, and keep their page clean, should be perfectly within your guidelines. Please get better. Being able to call out politicians for their cowardliness and faults is a crucially important part of the internet"
"Not responsible. My account has been deactivated for no reason since last week and I tried calling them sending an email, but they never responded. They are not responsible for your privacy and Im not sure whether someone hacked me or my account got deactivated for no reason, all I know is that Instagram support center should change its name to not responsible"
"Phone was hacked and tracked. Been using instagram since 2011 and I havent had any issues with it until recently when my account was hacked. Wish they suggested how to fix the problem instead of just letting you know through a quick notification in the activity section. Not sure how my account was hacked, and wasnt sure what to do afterwards. The malware was called smartmail.cyou. I uninstalled the app and probably wont be installing it again in fear that it might infect my phone again. I still have the malware on my old phone and havent been able to use it since. Instagram, please upgrade your cybersecurity measures and delete bot and spam accounts. You have more than enough money to do so"
Instagram. A great app when the FBI isnt hacking it
My own personal magazine. Being on Instagram is like having my own personal magazine filled only with things I love
Account Hacked. Does Instagram read these? My account has been hacked and I need help getting it back the person has logged me out and has even been able to go private smh I keep reporting the page but IG keeps saying the account isnt breaking community guidelines. If you can read this IG can u help?
"Ehh . Do to Instagram not sending me notifications when I have them turned on in the app as well as my personal settings.Hence,this app deserves three stars which in my book means either satisfactory, or in other words decent,and or tolerable.To be honest I actually believe this app could use a lot of help"
Hate the update. Having people you dont follows pictures in your personal feed is a dumb idea when you literally have a separate tab for that
Notifications. My notifications dont pop up on my phone I tried download it again and it still doesnt show I checked the settings on my phone and Instagram and their both on and my other apps does not do this but Instagram it been a month now
"Its just meh now. Ive checked my privacy settings 5x, updated the app, and rechecked settings all say my stories should be shareable by other people. Still get messages they cant be shared from stories. So annoying. Not to mention even when it notifies you that your reporting of a comment or account has been reviewed they dont always show you the resolution. So many accounts dont show in my feed or they show but days after the posts happened. Its not current at all unless its an ad, a sponsored post selling something, or a shopping notification"
A hair influenced. Ive been trying to grow my hair page for Over a year now and Ive been doing great instagram provides opportunities for young influencers like my self to grow and become someone on social if thats your goal and if not its still a great place for personal vlogs and other things
Too many hackers. Theres incidents flying around on Instagram where theyre getting notifications and private messages asking users for their information and code in the form of one of their followers. You should be ashamed. Youre invading the privacy of ushers by hacking into others accounts without their consent and my dad is a lawyer. Stop doing this
Hackers. There is a major hacker in your system and they are stealing everyones personal informations and getting to you through your friends
"No protection from Hackers. Ive been on Instagram for a few years but it wasnt until I got hacked that I realized how poor the customer service and account security is for this application. There is no phone number you can call to talk to a person  for support (its all automated and routes you back to their website), there has been no response from Instagram to my reports on the account being hacked. I was sent information to reconnect to my account and when I changed my password and set up two factor authentication the hacker was still able to connect to my account and change the email and other information without any notification sent to the email I had on file. I am once again disconnected from my account and extremely disappointed with Instagram. At this point Im trying to delete all of my content on my profile and am left to wait for an email from Instagram and a matter of minutes after that before the hacker retakes my account"
"Activity Feed Not loading on phone, tablet, and browser. This is day three I have sent multiple help tickets on username niahrosephoto by activity feed is not loading on this account only via iPhone, and android, and web browser on WiFi and on data. Also I have tried to get this fixed for over 3 years but I still am missing the share post to story. Please help Ive deactivated my account, Ive changed password, Ive switched to personal/business/creator Ive tried help tickets on Facebook &amp; instagram including trying to e-mail you guys. No one has ever contacted me"
STOP THE ZUCK. Zuckerberg needs to calm down with stealing data. If I wanted more of my data stolen I would move to Russia or China. CHANGE YOUR POLICIES
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. It gives you access to text people and have multiple accounts I have an edit account and a personal account and I can switch back and forth with ease. You can customize everything to be exactly the way you want it. You can chose how and what notifications you want and it helps a lot. I love this app and I recommend it to every teen or adult that wants to just have something to do
"app works ok but is poorly designed. Insta is entertaining and addicting. The Stories feature is totally weird and i still cant find a use case for it. Parts of the app are missing back buttons so you get trapped and have to close and restart the app to navigate again - thats a very big bug for such a big app. Adverts are dominant in the feed making it a chore to see content you follow, but a cleaner UI can be found by going to hashtag homes or other users homes. One assumes that the data mining is extensive and personal privacy of app users may be a major issue"
"Annoying Ads & Cluttered interface. Instagram has become a MESS. The new layout is cluttered and centralizes ads and content from people I dont follow. Putting more ads and suggested posts makes it harder to see content from my friends and the people I choose to follow.Reels is awful and full of tiktok recycled, amateur, irritating content by people I dont know.Facebook destroyed Instagram. Its never been more obvious that you and your data and shopping patterns are the product, not the customer. We have been sold to online retail and advertising"
Great Platform With Pros and Cons. Overall Instagram has been instrumental to the fast growth of my trading card business It has its drawbacks ethically but has incredible value for what I use this platform for Thanks
"Errooooor Less than . Its not the first time that this app limit the frecuency of my activities to protect the community. Instagram, what happen? I sent you more than 10 times this error, but you continue. You are toooo discusting and without reasons. Be careful world, you can lose your data"
One too many issues. Keep saying that my account has been hacked because I gave my password to an online site which isnt true and Im scared Im gone lose all my photos like my last Instagram account Then when Im trying to share my pictures to Facebook from Instagram their not posting. Annoying
"No, I really am not sure about this app anymore. All the changes that have happened since I started using it have made Instagram one of the most unappealing messenger platforms. I dont really want to see persistent ads for things Im not interested in or will never contemplate buying. Im not happy that it takes the data from my phone and uses it to spam me with irrelevant adverts. J am sure that the app listens and watches all the time even if I am not using it. If I talk about something, say, vegetables, an ad pops up for greengrocers or supermarkets. And when I report an ad as spam or not interesting, it just reappears again further down the feed. So why have the options to report the ads? Its not chatsnap or tiktok so why try to be them?  Seriously thinking of removing the app but will my data be deleted from the servers? I doubt it..... I think Signal will be a better option for me"
Need some privacy tho. Wish insta add a function that you can choose to block users that u dont want the to see who u followed and who ur followers are
Brilliant . In my opinion and what Ive heard from others is the best social media platform it gives you as much creativity as you like can has a lot of privacy aswell great app
Invades privacy and censors messages. Invades privacy and censors messages
"Love Everything. Love the App, Love the service, Love the content I use for both personal and Business. Thanks Instagram"
"Instagram Stories. Why. Afrer an entire year, so I am not have interactive stickers???1 Year layer June 2020My music sticker is fine, no Chat sticker and my business account looks like a personal account. Awesome...not really"
Poor privacy. Dont recommend
"New terms and conditions. Deleted my Instagram due to the new terms and conditions that went into effect on the 20th total breech of privacy, but this is there right to enter a contract agreement with you.Read up and stay woke. Dont be a sheep lol"
Notifications. Update: please make the explorer page optional I hate that feature.I hate that this app can detect your mobile contacts and invite you to follow that person on Instagram. It gives you the exact contact person name and direct them to their IG handle. It feels like an invasion of privacy and spying. Please tell me how do I deactivate this feature on my phone
"Being worst. To many adds and too many suggestions killing our privacy, I cannot enjoy with my friends posts I reported every post and Ads)"
"No..just no. Why cant we face it? Instagram and Facebook are so 2009. Over the years, they have prioritized $$$$, so what happens? We see stupid pictures that do not delight us, stupid ads that have tracked us to see what weve been searching, and stupid policies that make everyone angry. Every update feels like a downgrade. Also, not a fan of all of the ads. To be fair, I consider influencers advertisers, but it is just downright annoying. So whats the point in even using this app? Will be deleting my account and this app forever. Everything social media related, now a days, seems so superficial...its always hard to tell what is real and what is fake"
"Insta hurt me. Instagram disabled my solarxhijiri account for no reason, I literally got none. The last picture posted was of me and my children on Halloween. Then I tried to dispute it. I got told I needed the link to my insta for them to see. Then once I got it, I was told I couldnt use it because my account was disabled.  I had deceased family convos that are irreplaceable, wedding pictures my kids pics all irreplaceable. Hurt me. Im scared to make another personal account. I havent gotten over this one. I tagged Zuck nothing, inboxed Instagram nothing. I dont use it much anymore due to that"
New Service Agreement. This new service agreement is an abortion in regards to maintaining user privacy
"IG. Good app, but way too many fake accounts and hit ups. FB/IG really need to step their game up and take it seriously for others/ clients security. Loads of advertising also.sickening amount given the amount of information gathered and sold on the user"
"Make privacy/sharing options better. Why dont you all make it so that you can make individual posts private, or public, like Facebook? That would be great. Also, make it so you can share posts on timeline, not stories. Also, stop making me look at posts that Ive already scrolled by. I dont want to look through all their photos. If youre going to do the, youve seen all posts thing, then let me not have to see a post I ignored. And put it in chronological order I hate seeing something and then realizing it was from three days ago"
"Cant like posts unless on data. Keep getting an error message saying my account has been restricted? However, when I turn my wifi off and use my data it works fine. How has the issue still not been resolved after a week "
"NO SUPPORT. My account which Ive had for many years and was private and filled with just friends and family was hacked by a scammer doing who knows what. They hacked my email and once I kicked them out of there and recovered the emails from IG they deleted to try to undo this madness I found I could get nowhere. The IG help page said I could reverse these actions if it wasnt me but that was not the case. They changed EVERYTHING, username, email, phone number etc and I have tons of screenshots with proof including the IG page with their changed username and picture on top of MY personal photos of my family. This was all done from Nigeria early in the morning my time and I caught it within hours and had absolutely NO recourse. Why Instagram, do you allow all of this to happen from a completely different country (super red flags) with no safeguards in place. At the very least allow some recourse here A waiting period in between major account changes seems like the very bare minimum. Even more appalling is the total and complete lack of support. Absolutely no way to submit anything and these people just get to run rampant with their scamming. At this point I just want my page shut down. I have older family in that private account and its really scary not knowing what this person is doing. This is not a rare instance either, just search on Twitter Instagram hacked for example and youll see this is rampant. People are jumping on those posts with this person can get your account back and who knows what they are doing to scam those people Something needs to be done, this is ridiculous Im so frustrated and disappointed, in myself for not securing my accounts more (which Ive learned the hard way and done) but mostly in Instagrams total apathy and uselessness for its users that are just regular people. This will keep happening and I worry for older people especially who are vulnerable and dont know how to protect themselves digitally from these lowlifes. You need to do better Instagram"
"The real woolenrat. I mean you basically have a monopoly on social media outlets (hey Facebook Corp) so yeah Im satisfied with the app but what choice do I have if I want exposure? Jk the interface is clean and good, it doesnt crash, and I get featured in the Explore section here and there. So yeah sell all the personal info you need I guess"
Spy app. They use our info They sale our info This 2021 now we are for sale if someone pay more
"Biased (FREE PALESTINE). Censors info that doesnt fit their own beliefs, even if the said information is not harmful or does not go against community guidelines. FREE PALESTINE"
"Only use if you want your data harvested. Enough said. Used to enjoy it. Frankly, I still would of it were a free and fair open exchange. But its not. Sell your soul to Satan... or an a app. Perhaps youd be better to do neither?"
"Needs to be more user friendly. Great app, that has helped my business in a big way  Instagram just needs to be much more user-friendly with regards to re-posting, cutting off the sides of pictures, being able to edit by adding or removing pictures/video, etc. It seems like I need a different app or a teenager for everything (especially keeping track of those playing the follow unfollow game) Even the apps associated with a Instagram are not the greatest. I would gladly give five stars if it werent so difficult to use sometimes"
Terrible policies. They have been taking down meme accounts for no apparent reasons but do nothing to those accounts that steal photos and scam people. Not to mention spam accounts
"PLEASE LISTEN TO USER FEEDBACK. Seriously.Theres already a whole lot of problems, and now youre making it harder for people to share posts? Why? There is literally no reason to require video and microphone to share someones cool art post or a funny comic on stories. Are you doing this on purpose to push away content creators? Again, why??Absolutely horrible work. If this continues, Ill be taking my data elsewhere away from Facebook and their products.Thumbs down"
They collect ALL day on your phone and you cant do anything about it. Do NOT use this app. They collect you data and force you to accept that otherwise you cant use the app
Help me get my account back. Ive been using instagram for the last 10 years now and I was really happy about the unit my account gets blocked for some how tried everything calling them emailing them even with Facebook did the same thing nothing helped Im really upset with this and have my personal photos on there and everything
Great app. Excelente source of information for my business
"Stop blocking info. Love this site but do your duty as an American and stop blocking information and labeling it as disinformation. Get some REAL fact checkers if need be, not opinion checkers. Stand up for our country and DO THE RIGHT THING You will be glad in the end"
Hacked account. When your account gets hacked and all your private information is out thereas the hackers keep changing all your private log in information from email address to phone number.. all instagram does is send you to the help centre and there is no one to talk to. Cant recover account nothing to be done but left alone to figure it out
"Good app, with a few privacy flaws. Based on my personal opinion, the app was great with a few flaws along with it. Personally I believe that the app should provide its users with more privacy, such as not showing the people they follow or who follows them to the viewers. I also think that more security should be added to each account so not just anyone can follow your account. I also believe that there should be more security for kids, like the newly added rule on YouTube, the FTC (pardon me if Im wrong) creates rules to protect childrens identities, I believe that Instagram should adopt similar traits to protect the younger users. Overall I think this app is pretty reasonable, but it does have a few flaws that have to deal with security and privacy. And I believe that those flaws should be corrected"
"Hacked. I got hacked, the hacker put 2 step authentication in a different country, and poor instagram security allowed it. I cant recover account that I spent thousands on. And Instagram wont answer their phone. If your reading this, please report primaryengines account. Its been hacked and posting scam content"
"Horrible. The app is unbearable with the data chugging, battery draining ads appearing every two posts. Instagram use to be fun, now its just intrusive.I want to see my friends and their stories, not big corporations shoving their crap content and products down my throat. The app has been permanently removed"
"Suggested Posts . I already feel like Im not seeing everyones posts that Im following, and now I have to click out of Suggested Posts when IG says Im all caught up. Werent the posts in the search area already suggestions based on other views? I can handle the ads once in a while, theyve actually been far more relevant than what FB thinks I want to see, but I dont want my feed to switch to suggested posts  if I want to keep scrolling through things IG thinks Ive seen, or revisit something I saw earlier from a friend, I should be able to easily. Instagram is a great app. I understand it keeping up with trends like you did back when you opted for videos, then stories, and now Reels. The overall user experience doesnt need to change, though. Please dont make it less personal"
Instagram is not rly protective. Yeah Instagram looks cool and all but Ive noticed a lot of ppl are saying in there bio about there acc was hacked and this is there new one so was like yeah ok until I got hacked I fell like insta isnt that secure and is not good with the Hacking protection Im just saying so you know that if your profile looks good they might steal it
"Instagram is over. Between the constant updates, the shopping ads from highly questionable companies, the glitches from the updates, the lack of continuity between my three accounts - none of them have the same features ever - and the non-existent customer service just like Facebook, I am done. I am finally planning to retire my big fan account and only hang on to my personal because of the pics on it. Its just no fun anymore. Thanks Zuckerberg for ruining it along with Facebook. Its only about the money for you. You have enough"
"Useless. This app continues to get worse and worse by each passing day it seems. Nothing on the app works the way it claims to work, the personal account settings are essentially useless. I have a few accounts I use for different things and with some of them, notifications arent if any importance but even with them turned off in the Instagram settings, they still send me push notifications that pop up on my notifications as well as a number on the app"
"Awful. Worse thing to happen to Instagram was Facebook getting hold of it.   Theyve disabled 3 personal accounts for no reason, dont reply to the many emails Ive sent to customer support.  Awful customer support such a huge let down "
"You arent news. Dear Instagram - Your app is a social media platform, not news and information.  I have never in my life thought, wow, I need to check election results, and opened your app nor will I ever.  Please stop the election notification spam &amp; let us enjoy getting away from the world"
Hacked account and Instagram does nothing. My account was hacked and Ive sent in multiple reports. I am talking to the hacker on my Instagram DM. He is using the account to post about bitcoin mining and is trying to scam people using my pictures and my name. Instagram does not seem to care
"Its getting worse. Until another app comes up, Instagram will still act negligent about users privacy and requests of authenticity"
No help. The app works great but there is no help from Instagram if you account gets hacked and stolen. I lost my business account and I cant find anyway to recover it. So upsetting after I did so much work and got so many loyal customer. Im being threatened and blackmailed to get it back from the scammer
Instagram. Hello everyone instagram is a great app it is perfect to post videos and pictures also you can put your account  on lock so only your followers can see and like your post pretty cool at first I didnt really like or use the app now it is pretty cool but one thing I have to say sometimes it will get hacked I have not gotten hacked yet though but Im being careful now I hope my review helps you make a better decision
"Not secure / Too many hackers. Instagram used to be great, but its absolute garbage now. Until they figure out a way to help people get access back on their hacked accounts, Instagram doesnt deserve any stars. Beware because they will not help you get your access back when someone steals your account. Absolutely unacceptable DO BETTER IG"
"No real help when account gets hacked. So I use to love Instagram as a Facebook alternative but after getting hacked over the weekend it was a nightmare to recover my account. You have to read online instructions and possibilities then select the right one for your problem. No one is out there to help you and I was literally trying to change my phone number and password while the hacker whos located in Nigeria was trying to switch out my number at the same time so they could add in the two way authorization in order to lock me out of my account. I managed to get my account back but got hacked again so this time I changed my email and password then I set to delete my account. Years of stuff gone Shame on Meta for the worst UX experience I have ever encountered. We users trust you guys with our accounts and data. You guy really should fix this and see if someone who has had the account for years in the US and a different country hacks it, how about this and automatically freeze the account until the real owner proves its theirs. Ask a for 10 security questions, get 24 hour online security help with real people. I still have my biz account but I may just delete it too. Cant trust anyone"
Instagram . Love the ability to share important moments with friends and family. Only 4 stars because I think the support you receive when theres a problem like youve been hacked or had your account stolen is seriously wanting - Instagram you could learn a lesson from Amazon- they have you restored within 15 minutes
"Updates. Im not sure why ig is blocking my from seeing my own likes I continuously does it. Instagram has become annoying with all these privacy features. Its social media, why does everything have to be so suspicious or it feels like youre being watched for seeing your own profile, likes or comments. Ugh its become annoying"
"I cant freaking sign in to my account nor use this on mobile data :(. Everything on my phone allows apps to use mobile data. I did not exceed my limit, I used a valid email address and phone number. When I did actually sign into Instagram for once, I wasnt able to refresh ANYTHING, not reels, not my story, not anyone elses story, NOTHING I had full coverage for data and WiFi, and nothing loaded. Please fix this, I would love to enjoy using Instagram to promote my business, I dont know the issue here lol. When I look up help for Instagram on my browse it says invalid certificate wth?? Its literally the Instagram Support help center and its invalid? Doesnt make sense. I couldnt even send a report because I had no internet connection. Fix this and I will fix the rating on the app. Everyone else who had an iPhone uses Instagram problem free, why am I having problems?"
"Zuckerburg was on epstein island. I dont like big tech giants that censor information and truth.  Instagram is slightly more positive than fb in terms of engagement, but its still an elite spy horse And for that it sucks, i dont like my data mined nor my privacy invaded"
Protect us. Im sorry I have to write this review. I had my identity stolen and was used as someone else on Instagram. They screen shot my face and used it as their own. Im also an artist and have heard from other artist that their art work was stolen. So I hope you read this review cause I know it can be done. Im on a dating app that if you try and screen shot of someone it wont let you. It will give you a poster of the app it self instead of the picture you took. Its an amazing tool to protect people and artist. Please find ways tip upgrade that and protect your users. Thank you
"Unable to access certain features. I have more than one Instagram account. I have a personal and I also have a business account. For a reason unknown to me, my business account is not allowing me to post reels or access certain features that my personal account is able to. What can I do to fix my problem?? I would love to be able to reach my audience and expand my business. Please Help"
App listens to you. The app listens to you - you can tell by the advertisements. Start talking about how you are interested in buying truffles or going on a cruise. Itll pop up in your ads on the app. Privacy violation
Why I dont like Instagram. Spys on you
"Issues. I am very much getting annoyed with Instagrams new updates, but thats not why Im here why am here is because every other day my Instagram decides not to work, itll be like couldnt reload, couldnt connect to network, and I was wondering if it was on my and my Wi-Fi, or my data, and its not, Ive called all my Internet services, my phone service to make sure that everything was working perfectly fine, theres something wrong with the app, this is absolutely frustrating being the fact that I use Instagram for my small business, I dont know what is going on but please fix this soon, thats all I am asking"
Worst service. After having my account hacked and tries with the option of a selfie video several times. Instagram still would not give access. Tried the action of stating having no selfies on profile but obviously it wouldnt work for me as the email address linked to my account has been changed. Theres no one to talk to about this Personal information has been accessed. The humiliation and violation felt is beyond. Totally unimpressed Really thought Instagram would be there for their users
"Extremely user unfriendly. I am a small Instagram artist who has been using this platform since 2016. Ive noticed that my art has went from getting around 20 to 30 likes to around 10 maybe 15 likes at the most. And I think I have a very good reason for it.The algorithm and interface on this platform is an absolute joke. The shopping and reels tab have replaced the posts and notifications tab, moving them to the top right of the page.  Last time I checked Instagram wasnt a shopping site or a tiktok knock off My feed is littered with suggested posts and ads. I see content from people I follow for a few posts before they suggest me posts; which is fine because Im an artist but there is no way to turn it off or switch it to older posts by default. Thats what the explore feed is for. Which doesnt seem to work when I refresh it. And dont even get me started about the report system. It takes forever to report something illegal or truly harmful but if its over a stupid opinion or using an action too much youre caught. Get your priorities straight Overall if you want to use this app to get popular, I would not recommend it. They promote influencers and big name companies while leaving artists struggling to survive"
Over-reaching into the Privacy of its users. This last new update gives IG way too much power over our privacy. Its become a cancer to its users
Instagram is getting worst on there security. Instagram is not really giving a lot to help get our account back after it has been hacked and getting these messages from people who got hacked and using there account to hack other. Then after my mother got hacked by someone who gave her a message. Im saying this because they should help get our accounts back from these people who hacks and they should stop them too. Another thing is when we contact Instagram they didnt give us information or email of having our account back
"Significant decrease in likes and impressions. Hello, the new instagrams policy is terrible. I am a longtime user and used to make money from my account to make the ends meet and support my family but with the new update I don&#39;t even sell a product through a month since instagram refuse to show my post to followers and feeds. Please restore the setting to the previous version. I am a student and instagram is my only chance for making money"
Story sharing/hacking. Use to love sharing my photos on Instagram. But for some odd reason my follows are not able to share my store. My privacy settings also does not have the sharing enabled. So I have no way to change it. Also a lot of my friends and family members Instagram are getting hacked and are impersonating the people. Instagram has done nothing. We have reported it and Instagram continues to let people to impersonate others. Instagram needs to get it together
"Accounts centre. The part where it is becoming more deficit for community manager to do their job, the accounts center update prevents people who are managing multiple accounts from doing so... why letting people having/being admin of multiple page on Facebook if you wont allows them to use the same logging to do their jobsIs it because you need more people to make account so you can sell their data or what??No way to contact customer support when there is an issue. I wonder if they event get the report"
Fix the issue. The issue of instagram cant edit my information cant even see the info the screen goes black thats why I giving 2 stars thanks
Too much advertisement. Too much advertising and too little privacy  Unfortunately its necessary to connect with the people
"HORRIBLE AT LISTENING TO REPORTS. There have been more and more scammers and people hacking/posing as people to get money out of innocent mutual friends that are under the impression that it is indeed their friend but in reality its been hacked. My friends ig got hacked, he reported it as well as his friends did once they found out, but you guys (Instagram) did nothing about it Because of that I was scammed and hacked out of a lot of money. I did everything I could to contact a File that my ig was hacked, I did the facial recognition video, I had my friends report them and still nothing happened Since then they have deleted my ig and all my personal photos, some which I can never get back This absolutely breaks my heart and infuriates me at the same time. Not only was I scammed out of a lot of money, my photos are forever gone, and now this could be still happening to another innocent mutual friend or Anyone else out there because Instagram isnt doing anything about hacked account and when multiple people report a profile. This has got to end And you have got to take these reports seriously and urgently If not Instagram will be known more as the scammers free for all site"
Blocking my comments and posts. Ive been using Instagram for a long time now. I do have multiple accounts on Instagram from personal accounts to business accounts. Recently I created my hair page on Instagram @luxuryhairbabies and Id been trying to gain followers by following other people to gain a bigger audience for my business page. Instagram suddenly stopped allowing me to make comments on others pictures and posting pictures on my page. I dont know why this is happening but Im updating Instagram right now to see if it solves my issue
My thoughts on Instagram. I find it difficult to navigate around And at first I didnt know how to set up my privacy correctly so a bunch of people started to follow me. I dont like that theres not an extended profile you have no idea who these people are or where theyre from and unless youre set up for private account? Which I now am? Anybody can follow you and I dont like that at all theres a bunch of idiots on Instagram
Add Custom Story (Not Close friends). Its annoying to see that instagram doesnt have story/highlight privacy like facebook for example Custom Story many people want and need that so people would really appreciate it if you add that
"I dont get why people are rating 3, 4, or 2 stars. Hello, I am a huge fan of instagram. Dont take me as one of those girls that is a huge fan of taking selfies and stuff, but if you think I am, Im really not..Im some tomboy. Im sorry, let me get to the point of why you should get instagram. 1. Its really fun to look at cute pictures or any of those stuff. 2. You can talk to friends and family. 3. You can post anything you would like. 4. You can see all kinds of cute animals and you can follow them. 5. You can make a few accounts. 6. You can follow anyone, and I mean ANYONE. 7. You can make your account private just in case you just want friends and family to follow you only. 8. You can post a lot on your story like anything, and when I say anything I mean ANYTHING. 9. There is no ads and its not a game but its kinda like Facebook, kinda. 10. Idek..its just a really nice app.. Make sure to download Insta. Goodbye"
"yeet. Instagram is great. Totally recommend it. Great to keep in contact with your friends and family. And tip, try to get more privacy, so people are more safe. If people are safe, more we get it. -Thanks, Fried CHicKen"
"iPad, orientations, notifications, followers. The iPad app has sucked for years. You cant reorient the app. Recently unread notifications will NOT go away. Unless you reply, we know this is intentional, were not stupid.Very few of my followers see my posts even though they INTENTIONALLY followed me, you can no longer change notifications to see all for a profile you follow. Cuz, you know, they want to sell ads.Get your billions together folks, USERS are your clients not BIG BUSINESS. Of you dont have us, they cant sell products and you cant sell ads. Dont think we wont eventually go elsewhere"
"Removed my video when it didnt violate community guidelines. Instagram used to be good for reaching brands and posting pictures, however I posted a very short singing video which clearly didnt violate any of the community guidelines but it was immediately removed for some reason and my actions were then restricted meaning I couldnt follow anyone new and stopped me from doing other things. Im really fed up of IG removing posts that arent problematic yet they allow blackface and hate speech up even after they get reported. Make it make sense and sort out your priorities, values and your awful customer service. Ive now deleted my account and couldnt be happier. Lol see ya "
Not worth using. Its got nothing but bots and fake people pretending to be each other.  Your account gets deleted for literally every last thing you post lol Im surprised they arent deleting accounts for posting pictures of food too at this point
F U. Stay off my personal information
"Lack of Genuine Authentic Community. Instagram is not a playful place to check in with your friends. It is a place for our minds and our usage to be tracked. Ive used Instagram since 2013, and as an artist I've struggled with the app no longer being relevant or aligned with being a place to just connect. When I spend less time on Instagram for my mental health Im immediately punished as my postings will reach fewer people. Instagram has transformed from a playful platform to a commerce centered algorithm controlling the way people feel after using the app. Im not impressed"
"We need to leave Instagram. This app isnt what it used to be. It has been ruined by greedy/corrupt developers. Apart from that your privacy is at a high risk. Someone please create a solution, a new app that is right because needs to be canceled"
"Sketchy account security. This app has changed for the worse, it used to be a place where you used to share your besets memories. NowIt turns out that other people can share your bestest and your most worst memories without you even knowing if your password is known by anyone else. It used to be a app where if someone logged into your account you would certainly know as you would get signed out of your own on your own device whatever you were using yourOwn account on. I feel much less safer knowing the fact that anyone anywhere can log in and expose me and my personal chats,posts and also memories at any time and I would nit even have a clue. Surely this would repel any type of demographic audience against using this app as there are no boundaries and certainly no more security between using the sameAccount at the same time through multiple deceives. Instagram used to be a place of security and peace of mind now its a thing where you can spy on your own friends and partners without even telling themYourDoing it. Do you think this is healthy for this generation of technology or is it just me?  Anyways Im now going to spend the rest of my evening getting rid of old passwords just incase my accounts are being looked at by other people as I used to have the same password forEveything. One thing I know for sure is that Im not the only cumstomer that will now have to go over their accounts security just because of a more dodgey update. Even Snapchat is safer coz at least you can make yourself into a ghost mode. For Instagram its always left to be exposed mode"
Just more spying trash from the Zuck. Folks need to reed the EUA. They can use your mic. They can track you. Doesnt matter if you shut it off on your phone. You gave them permission by installing the app
New update is awful and hard to navigate. Awful user interface design that leads to a terrible user experience. Instagram became less of a creativity photography app and more a walking advertisement. All i see are ads on my feed and you cant even easily access the notifications button anymore bc it was replaced w the shop button.This is awful UI. If you know the mapping of an iPhone you will know that the notifications and posting a picture icons are now in the reach part of the screen. That is terrible as the main point of the app is to post pictures and check notifs: NOT post a REEL?? Or shop for clothes. I can use tiktok for reels and i can just use google to look for clothing.Instagram went downhill. Everything facebook owns turns bad bc they make it confusing and not easily accessible. Its very hard to navigate and theres just way too much going on and using the app is no longer enjoyable. I used to use this app for HOURS. Ive been using Insta since 2013 and i will not be using it often anymore. Hopefully you change the updates or well just wait for a new social media app thats better than this
"the update no one asked for. The new update completely disregards the user experience. Instagram has just becomeanother app to exploit its users to sell stuff and make money. What a shame its not  about pictures and content anymore. Also, the algorithm is rigged to see content from accounts I do not even follow. Theres no point even having this app anymore because I use it to follow accounts I want but the algorithm is written against that"
"Great. I always enjoy Instagram, posting is a piece of cake and all the functions of insta are great. I enjoy the recommendations from insta and I love the explore page with everything that's collected together that I'm interested in. Great app, just wish my info was a bit more private and not sellable for profit"
Privacy Issue. Doesnt protect my privacy with the active status
Personal review. Instagram is entertaining n educative.It relieves stress n calms anxiety
Reels and music. I have a business account but business accounts do not have access to music. Why are we exempt from this incredible business building feature? This only helps with marketing and promotion. Thats only better is my business. Why would I have a business account if I cant better my business through social media?
Kicks you off for conservative views. Shadow bans and stores enough meta-data that making new accounts is difficult
"no ipad app, forces the app if you want delete stuff. so. insta cant be bothered to make an ipad app, yet it forces me to put their iphone app on my huge ipad pro just to manage my own content.it wont allow me to delete my own work from mobile safari.they act as if they own my data and should decide when or if i can manage it.without our uploads, insta dies. they should be doing every single user-friendly thing possible. we should be able to work with our own stuffthe stuff that makes insta (facebook-owned now) millions of dollars.all the money they make from the work of others, and they cant even make an ipad app. (not knocking the programmers, they do a good job on what they are hired to do; its the company itself im addressing, and other users).i havent added one single thing to insta for well over a year and i wont be every again. its my work, not instas. im tired of how huge companies have siloed off the internet, selling our data, becoming wealthy from users, and locking down our stuff and our options in every possible way.if we stop using them, they wither and die"
"Just to let you know. This app has for the feds , you wanna get caught in your personal life go ahead download the app , while they spy on you through the app"
"Updates great. Keep them coming. I love Instagram. And they have heard my cries before and have improved. Ive been irked since Facebook bought them. Hasnt been smooth sailing since. I hope updates come in the form of: 1. Instagram Lives stop glitching 2. More than one person can Be in a live. At least four especially during at home orders with the coronavirus. 3. Can we PLEASE keep our usernames if we change them? And send them to someone easily if they want them. With a permission code.  Hell. Even send them to our other private/personal accounts with a code please, cause thats our business. 4. Can we PLEASE have a six count limit for accounts managed. Im simply admin for work accounts. And then I have my own personal and personal public account.  It enough room. 5. Can the updates apply to ALL accounts"
"Things that can go wrong. So I had a account for like a year or so and yeah it was nice totally love the idea of Instagram. but then it just got hacked out of nowhere, and then it wasnt letting me make another account and all it was showing was the change your password screen. And it wasnt letting me try to make another and once I finally made another it just got hacked again in like less than 10 minutes. And my account was private with a lot of security on it and a good password. So I was very confused on how it got hacked and the thing that made me mad was once I got hacked, my Instagram pictures that were private went public. And Im kinda upset that my pictures are public bc I dont want them being up there forever.  So I feel like instagram should make more security to it. if thats possible for them, and to make it easier to make new accounts after one has got hacked bc trying to make a new one its hard"
Feed playing videos. Need a way to turn off and limit videos playing in the home feed. Should be able to limit to WiFi only or turn off completely if desired. Facebook gets a Grade of F for helping with limiting data usage
"Harmful to health. This app runs harmful algorithms that could be offensive or illegal, it shows signs of being harmful to health and finances for personal users over time"
"My account was hacked and Instagram doesnt care. Yes, my account was hacked. Ive reported it daily. Ive gotten nowhere and the hacker continues to scam people Using my information"
Instagram feedback. I truly enjoy Instagram .. the variety of posts suites my interest ..and I lol forward to spending times on this app  My worry is about privacy and people who send me request  are they authentic or are they scamming me .  I do have some safety concerns  I like the comments and being able to comment on various posts and I love the search button   So many interesting posts  Thank you Instagram for bringing enjoyable times into my life  Cheers 
"Just keeps getting worse. Somehow each update makes Instagram worse than it was before. They just throw an algorithm on everything they can and its ruining the app. First the feed, okay annoying but whatever, then the stories, annoying but okay. Now theres even an algorithm on who likes your posts and your notification tab. Its making me not even want to use the app. Why am k seeing suggested posts on my feed before I even see everybody I follows posts. I have 350,000 followers and follow thought 450 people. Its almost impossible to keep up with my friends. There needs to be a way to edit your data because Instagram keeps showing me sports, and other irrelevant things on my explore page that I care absolutely nothing about and its making the whole experience on the app horrible. Its truly becoming unbearable.Something also needs to be done about the grown men sending unsolicited nude pictures of themself and harassing people. The app doesnt feel safe and its really becoming a desperate cash grab. Instagram is headed towards a bad direction and there doesnt seem to be any sign of stopping"
bring back how insights used to function for non personal profiles. can you guys PLEASE go back to the old version of the insights because having the times and and the days that have the recommended time to post was really useful and now it gone
Pretty interesting. I have a problem in instagram every time I try to change my profile picture Is telling me that  I need to fix my internet connection and Im using data to upload the photo and doesnt work either
I am not a fan of the new terms and conditions. The censorship and lack of privacy is unacceptable
Terms of service are draconian. Beware of terms of service. You have no privacy or freedom of thought
Very Unhappy. Very disappointed with the new terms of use. Instagram isnt even hiding the fact that theyre spying on us and using all of our information and photos. Deleted Instagramyou all should too
Sad. I love love Instagram however I noticed that my app was deleted off my phone and I went to re-download it again and I cant For some reason it wants my debit card information which is stupid cause its a free app I would love to be back on here but thats not gonna happen if I cant even download it
"Plubby. Insta is really good to communicate with family and friends, facetime, texting but there can be bullys on here so get a parent to keep track of ur profile"
"Update messenger. When i open settings in my Instagram account  The messenger update isnt on the list with follow and followers , notifications, privacy  Please how can i fix this problem"
"handy for keeping in touch. the rest stinks. keeps serving me adverts for luxury apartments i don\'t need. awful algo keeps my explore feed populated with low quality content skimming wildlife accounts from russia, insta thots who promote body dysmorphia, and influencers who make people think their lives aren\'t great. but it\'s handy for keeping in touch. sells information about me to other people and companies. no way to opt out of privacy and intellectual property intrusions with micro payments. the algorithms the company uses discriminates against marginalized people especially POC, queer people, and SW"
"Disabled account for no reason. Ive been using Instagram for a long time. My favorite app. I always trusted the app and add people that I met on my solo trips to keep a connection. I have pictures that I keep as memorys. And one day it said that they were verifying my information so I confirmed. After this I havent been able to get back in my account and it is disabled. I did what I could by following the steps of help. But they dont seem to care much. I believe I was hacked or Instagram just disabled for no reason. They are asking me to make another account but, the information that I had and there Im not gonna get it back. I am begging for Facebook company to help me. Because what they have done has not helped at all. If I dont get it back all I can say is DO NOT TRUST INSTAGRAM IT IS NOT AN APP TO CONNECT FRIENDS, like they make it sound. Thank you but I have lost my pictures and friends that got no other way to get a hold of"
"Extremely user unfriendly. I am a small Instagram artist who has been using this platform since 2016. Ive noticed that my art has went from getting around 20 to 30 likes to around 10 maybe 15 likes at the most.

Screw you insta"
New ToC. Uninstalled and not using this platform anymore. Not a fan of them trying to make it okay to go through my personal information
"The new update is so bad. instagram does it again with continuing to place advertisements and money making above its actual users. the new update is a nightmare layout wise, making it harder to access actual posts and notifications while somehow having a? shopping section? front and center. what was it about your picture-sharing social media app that made you think i wanted to see clothes i dont really want to buy instead of the notifications from my friends? its a stupid update spurred by greed and a lack of care for its users, and its made instagram virtually unusable"
"No support. I dont know if Instagram was ever great with support if you have a major problem but I do know its pretty much non existent now . I lost my account Mousetouristblog . Its gone , deleted I guess and although I sent numerous messages and appeals to Instagram for help to get it back or even some sort of explanation I heard nothing . Ive this happened to others who had larger following then me , business accounts and lost revenue ( I had 7k ) for them and no answered either . One day a social media platform will come along that makes sense , doesnt spy on you like FB and Instagram and wont bombard you with adds . A company needs a revenue stream but you should get some support in return . I will never boost my posts on Instagram again or buy anything you advertise for"
Features dont work. I use Instagram regularly for both my personal and my business. I understand its one of the most popular apps out there but what is the point in adding new features like reels and music audio but it doesnt work. Clearly I have a problem with my version so you would think after reporting it daily for a MONTH someone would look into it. Its a fun app but the support side of things is shocking. There is no support
Bob. Wish they didnt track your stuff no privacy
"Just a sales tool. This app was fun in its inception when it was a way for people to share personal updates on their lives but now its just a money making scheme. Just another way to advertise yourself, build a following, become an influencer. If you dont build a following then you are the one following influencers. Losing interest in feeding the capitalist machine"
"Owned by Facebook. Just joined a while ago and it was a great app in terms of ease and accessibility. The main reason im deleting it because of Zucc.I dont want anything to do with Facebook, and Im not giving my data up to someone like him"
Needs to stop trying to be tiktok. I use instagram for photosharing and connecting to friends yet instagram insists on copying tiktok and youtube. The reason people started using the app was to share their lives and photos with community. I hate that every 5 seconds Im being advertised something to buy. I dont use the shopping or reels feature. I hate that my feed isnt in chronological order. Stop relying on data to make the app better. After these updates on video and content creators I will be deleting this app. Instagram stop trying to be something that users dont want
Hacked. Every time Im on Im hacked instagram has terrible privacy
"THANK YOU. My name is Sheryl Hall,  I was scared at one point of my page and starting a social media platform because of a lot of the negative things you here today  But I thank this team on Instagram letting and allowing me to post my contents without even to worry of my account being hacked,  which has happened on several occasions,   your team helped me with this alongside with my personal information  The Instagram organization is very up to date of all that is happening and I am very pleased with all of my outcomes.  I am a very happy customer,  please keep up the amazing job you all are doing"
Locked out. I had gotten logged out when someone hacked into my account. I had forgot to update my phone number. I have requested support many MANY many times. I have family on there that only communicate through Instagram. Its very upsetting because I have done everything you guys have asked of me and still I cant access my account. Before this whole ordeal I loved the app and had no issues. I just want my account back
Terrible security and reporting. My Instagram accounts keep getting hacked as I suddenly find myself following thousands of accounts. Due to their policies you cannot unfollow more than 100 accounts a day.Deleting your account is a hassle as you have to log into Instagram on your browser and then inform you that your account will be deleted in a monthConstant messages from fake/spam accounts despite changing privacy settings is annoying.Didnt receive any alerts when my account was logged on from a location half way across the world by someone else like other apps do to stop hackers getting into accounts
Activity. Bring back activity tab whats the point of liking stuff it feels like a surgery straight to sell my information
"ACTION BLOCKING AND ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Maybe this angry review will get some attention from someone, anyone who works for Instagram?  For months, the app has been action blocking me.  I am not able to follow new accounts, comment on posts, upload photos or videos to stories, comment on lives and people have reported that they cant comment on my posts either.  I receive a pop up notification that I am violating community guidelines.  I assure you, the picture of fluffy, white clouds I wanted to share was not offensive to anyone.  When I check the security reports on my account, there are none.  Its a personal account that is not used for any unseemly purposes.  Ive submitted countless reports that have never been acknowledged.  Ive tried deleting and reinstalling the app.  Ive tried accessing customer support through the link in the App Store.  It times out.  If the 2008 recession taught us anything, its that no company is too big to fail and right now, Instagram, youre failing"
Instagram. Blocked on instagram for no reason no way of getting back 200 photos plus data they can not be held accountable clearly something has to be done
"Instagram has been and still is my nightmare. Just because I purchased a new iPhone and transferred from a Android when I went to upload my Instagram account the profile page changed and went directly to a new account with a different username. Nothing I did. Every time I try to change the username it refuses saying it belongs to someone else. When I put my email info. In the profile it says its not available. Someone elses. Instagram sent me a code number and said to put that number on a piece of paper with other information, hold the picture in front of my face take a pic. and send it to them since I have pictures of me in my account. After doing everything they asked for they said it wasnt enough information. Now its just harassment to me. Thats my friends, my pictures and my account that I dont have access to. Instagram needs to smarten up.  They also respond to my email address that they say isnt mine and refer to me with my username that they say belongs to someone else. People working there dont know what theyre doing"
"Bad Security. If I was able to give them no stars I would. Someone hacked into my account and changed my password and email and I wasnt able to get back into my account. I tried to get a hold of instagram, filled out multiple forms and have not heard anything back. Im getting messages from people that the person is still on my account messaging other people. Does instagram not keep track of that stuff and notice suspicious activity? Instagram monitors comments and whatnot but cannot notice scammer activity? Makes no sense. I am very disappointed with their security and upset of all my lost memories that I will never get back. Instagram do better. I am still waiting for a response"
Privacy settings. Please fix the fact that I can no longer log into my insta on the application Every time I try logging in I get Error Its so horrible I have to use the website and can never post anything anymore? Is that ur goal?
Instagram blocked my device. Instagram have wrongly blocked my device and now I cant use any of my accounts (personal &amp; business) on my phone because I unfollowed a few too many inactive dead accounts too fast. Ive effectively been blocked and punished for being an active user and the support just isnt there so I cant resolve this issue at all with them
"No privacy. I made an account with a brand new, never used email address. I never gave them permission to look at my contacts and somehow as soon as I open the damb app it somehow knows people I went to school with Some of them arent even in my contacts So much for privacy Thanks Mr. Zucc"
first aliexpress looking feed now. now bo privacy??
"Censorship and lack of privacy. This app is censoring stories to do with freeing Palestine. It is deleting accounts, comments and not showing stories about the genocide. There has also been instances that those who are not following a person can view there stories and delete their accounts ( aka Israeli forces) this is mass censorship and it is scary I cannot support this app"
Great App. Its a great app to socialise and a real opportunity to get creative. The privacy settings let you as private or not as you want. I really recommend this app
Privacy breaches. Unprecedented violations of privacy
"Zuckstagram. Got my account nuked with no reasons or warnings given. One day I tried to log in and the app wouldnt work. Come to find out they not only deleted my account, but they banned my phone from logging in through their app. Trash company run by dirty stinky filthy Jews who hate freedom of expression. Dont even bother. They steal your data and sell it to god knows who"
"I should thank you. This app has sucked for a while. Really, its a good thing. I used to spend hours on Instagram every day, now even checking it once a day feels like a chore. I frequently go days without checking the app. Its only value to me was to keep up with friends and creators I like, but the app is borderline unusable for that purpose, so whats the point? If the app wants to be a shopping mall, thats fine, but dont expect me to log in to look at pictures when all youre doing is selling me stuff and stealing features from other apps. Hopefully they listen to users before they become obsolete. Their app is for posting pictures, its nothing we cant do anywhere else"
No protection from hacking. My Instagram account has been hacked (my email and phone number have been changed) and I no longer have access to it. The dangerous think is that Instagram doesnt provide any possible help for this case in order to recover the account. This is very shameful of a big company like Facebook/Instagram
"Ease of sharing content. I love how easy it is to share content between TikTok, insta, and fb.  Loving the addition of reels and how easy it is to match up your last movement for a transformation in stories. The ease of switching back-and-forth between personal and business account is fantastic"
Allows fake accounts to hack others. Do a better job with your account reporting system. Theres so many fake spam accounts about making money that IG is losing credibility. Its getting lame
"Deleted / Erased DMs. Once Again Instagram Has Deleted Everyones Messages. For Why Tho, Yall Always Doing Unnecessary Stuff. Users Have Messages With Ppl Whove Passed Or Important Messages To Look Back On. Whoever Idea This Was, Dont Let Them Input Another One. Thats Like An Invasion Of Privacy. I Want My Messages Back Stop Doing Weird Stuff Thinking That Thats Just A Cool #1 Idea, Yall Dont Know Anything About Cool. Higher More POC Or Something Bc Every Idea Yall Have Is Ridiculous"
"We need to leave Instagram. They failed at muting the people I follow despite me literally muting. This app isnt what it used to be. It has been ruined by greedy/corrupt developers. Apart from that your privacy is at a high risk. Someone please create a solution, a new app that is right because this needs to be canceled"
"What is Happening?. Ive had this app for years - since 2011 with my personal account, then in 2014 with my book blog account, and 2021 with my writing account. My little bookstagram helped me connect with a community of readers, network with professionals, and even get my last 2 jobs. However, the insistence on algorithms, an influx of ads, and turning this platform into a Tik Tok wannabe has me debating if I should even keep it moving forward. I work in marketing and e-commerce, and I shouldnt have to spend all my free time searching ways to market myself on an Instagram account that used to be fun. I have over 4K followers and can barely get 10 likes on my posts most days. Ive put a lot of work into evolving my account over the years and trying to adjust to the changing times but I just cant do it anymore. Its time consuming and frustrating. I barely see things my friends and other bloggers post anymore. Theres no engagement - nothing. Ive posted reels as per algorithm suggestions and get almost no insights, likes, or shares, and forget it if I take a day or two off from posting at all. You punish us for it. Youre only interested in competing with Tik Tok and boosting already popular influencers while leaving us little guys hanging and hidden. If I wanted to use a video dominated platform, Id use one. Just let us post and hashtag our pictures and stop turning the space into an algorithm game thats impossible to play let alone beat"
"Injustice. On December 15th my account was hacked by another hacked account which I assume was an acquaintance reaching out. Instantly, my account was hacked: username changed, password changed, e-mail changed, and phone number changed Quickly I posted on all of my social media accounts to warn my loved ones of the activity and to avoid the hacker I made a new account and reported my previous account which the hacker took over, that the hacker is trying to be me and messaging my followers that I am me. Ten minutes ago, I get an update that my report was looked into and that the hacked account which was originally mine doesnt break any guidelines so I should block the user. Because of this is why hackers continually to do damage across instagram and other social media platforms and its disappointing that instagram isnt doing much to protect their users, their account, and privacy. Security system is lacking so much and nowadays with all the advantages of adding payment methods, contact information, and other personal information, instagram isnt taking the necessary precautions to protect and serve their users in anyway. I dont care about regaining my original account, which would be nice, but to disabled the account that ended up hacked to stop this activity onto other users. Its disappointing getting an update on my report and simply saying they didnt do nothing wrong.block them Thats going to change the entire situation and prevent hackers to continue their filthy activities and overrunning instagrams accounts Its like the digital version of covid"
"If you value privacy on a shared device. Dont get this app Password is useless because once you hit auto log-in you cant turn it off Not even if you change your password Help center is of no help. Your device will not be private, and anyone on your phone can access and post on your account. I am forced to delete my account now, but I cant from my phone. I need to get somewhere with a computer.Thanks Instagram for betraying my trust in your security and privacy measures"
"Good but unsafe. Instagram is good for looking at videos, talking to friends and other instagram stuff but does not value your privacy. Instagram is quick to take your personal information and you can see this as it shows people you know irl and youtubers you watch etc. I would not recommend this app for young children"
"Sorry there was an error with your request. I am getting this note constantly saying Sorry there was an error with your request when I try to log in, and the official app on my phone will not allow me to log into ANY accounts at all. This has been going on for over almost a year and Ive been trying to fix it and reported my problem a few times. I believe Instagram thinks my phone is a bot and has blocked it completely to having access to the app. Its very frustrating because I liked to use Instagram a lot until it started giving me this problem. I did not even get any warnings at all so I am completely shocked and bewildered"
"Good but support is disappointing. Ive used Instagram for years for personal and business use and it has many great features. Unfortunately, Im a bit disappointed since Ive made multiple inquiries and tickets to seek assistance as to why Im not able to share feed posts to my story even when theyre public. Ive faced this issue with multiple accounts and would really like to see this fixed"
Consent. You do not have my consent to invade my privacy
Do I get privacy??. Good app but it uses my camera while Im scrolling without informing me so thats not fun
Love ig. Very nice they respect privacy love it
"I love Instagram but. I love Instagram, but I cant really change my profile information. Its annoying and I think this is a bug. Also, its too many spam accounts. I hope you all get it under control  Overall, the app is fine"
"Great but youll waste a lot of time. Its a great app to share parts of your life on, see hilarious reels, even learn some quick fact. But Youll spend hours looking at nothing, youll come across pseudo-science presented as fact. Youll sexism, racism and all forms of hate.All the while data about you is collected and sold"
Stop stealing my data. You know what I mean
"Zero stars if I could. They wouldnt p*ss on you if you were on fire. Zero stars. Instagram claims to bring you closer to the people and things you love... what a joke.It is supposed to be safe to take a temporary break from your account and come back and still have it be there- but it clearly is NOT. Instagram I have been trying repeatedly and unsuccessfully to get access to my instagram account. I had temporarily disabled it weeks ago (NOT deleted) and had another account (for my dog) linked on there under the same login details. At the time when I created that second account, the option was not there to have separate login details for each account, or I would have.Now when I try to log back in, I can only access the second Dog account and not my original account. My whole account is just gone There seems to be no record anywhere and changing passwords and accessing the account other ways does not help. It just says that username does not exist and all my phone, email and other details seem to connect to my dogs account only. Yet I have my business website with a photo reel connected to the Account- now it just shows up as page not found. The name is still showing as taken when you go to create another one. I had my Facebook connected and now its like those posts have had their tie severed. My dog account was even linked to my original and had the handle mentioned in the bio- now that handled is deactivated. I have been OVER AND OVER the help functions and repeatedly reported the issue and asked for help - but I cannot get anywhere on the links you have been advising other ppl to access. I NEED AN ACTUAL HUMAN on the back end to work out what is going on. Its like I was hacked and the original account was deleted. Or the user details merged into the second account or something.. most likely when Instagram did one of their updates while I was temporarily offline. here I have a website and a business going on in the background and I own the domain name purchased for this instagram handle- my account is in there somewhere I just cant access it. THIS IS LITERALLY EFFECTING MY BUSINESS and I CANNOT CONTACT ANYONE TO HELP.WHAT IN GODS NAME IS GOING ON AND HOW THE HELL IS THERE NO HELP TO FIX THIS??? PLEASE can someone help fix this? WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? Clearly this is an issue for many- instead of updating new fun features how bout you work out the actual kinks first"
"Sad. Ive had multiple accounts since 2015  I used to be addicted to social media  Now that Im not I can see all the many things wrong with social media and especially this app  The shopping feature is dumb  The moving buttons around is dumb  Having only one account get an update when the other doesnt, even though its the same app on the same phone, is dumb  I also really miss the layout where the profile pic was on the right and the followers number wasnt big in everyones faces and the name and bio were bigger as well  That being said I do like that the views and likes can be hidden etc  The reels try too hard to be tiktok  The messages although I like different themes there arent enough interesting ones  The porn bot accounts are annoying .. Real people get their accounts taken down while all the bots just keep popping up  I just wish this app was about sharing pictures and 1 minute videos again  Stories are really extra .. privacy is just unheard of these days  Its so annoying .. Also the comparing your life to others is very easy to do with this app  Anyway I already deleted it but you guys should too its not only annoying but its unhealthy. Get your real life back and stop worrying about what others are doing. Find yourself. Get a career. Be happy. Read a book or write one. Go outside. Get a job. Pick up some productive hobbies. Just detach from socials. Its not real life"
Business Account. I love Instagram but as a business account theres certain features that are not available as for the regular personal account
"Default audience to fb only me, cant change. Cant figure out how to change default audience for cross-platform posts to Facebook. Ive looked everywhere in both apps. Every time I post to Facebook from Instagram, I have to manually go onto my Facebook wall and change the privacy settings from only me to friends in order for people to see it. Incredibly frustrating and waste of time"
"App update horrible. The redesign of our own personal newsfeed is absolutely horrible  It used to be suggested people to follow showed up as one horizontal feed, now there&#39;s one right after the other to the point I can&#39;t even get back to someone I actually know.  Please put it back to the way it used to be.  I got rid of FB because of useless stuff in my feed and used to tell everyone to go over to Instagram... it will go too if it&#39;s going to stay like this"
Account disabled. My account has been disabled for no reason and it says that we will review your info and if we can confirm it you will be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours. It has been more than 24 hours and I have not gotten any update which is ridiculous. I have so many memories and people associated to that account. This is very shameful on Instagrams part and should be taken care of immediately
"Too many changes. Listen these arent updates, these are methods to track and share our data with. People dont pay attention to that when they update this app or anything by Zuckerberg. Just pay attention to what you allow on your phone. Why does this app -need- access to your contacts? To other sensitive info about you? Your sms messages? Hes a creep and a voyeur at this point. I hope someone sees this and finds this helpful"
"Here are some ideas I think you will love. I have been using Instagram since it become very popular honestly, I really really do think one feature should be added that I have not seen that would just make our experience for our personal one at home use a little better. That is letting us move around our pictures on our profile making like a black and white block system or six colored and then to black-and-white vice versa etc. I think it would be really awesome just to be able to move them around and put them in place where we like them instead of having to delete and repost so often Giving us the option to switch around our photos almost like the apps in our phone would be just amazing"
Latest update. After the latest update I can honestly say that Instagrams quality of service has downgraded... I cant even see what my friends are posting because Im bombarded with post of people I dont know and I would never follow. The personal user experience has been totally neglected and has now been taken over by sponsored account and that really takes the fun out of the app
"FULL OF HACKERS. BE AWARE THIS APP IS SO EASY TO HACK YOU ARE NOT SECURE ON IT , MY DAUGHTER ACCOUNT GOT HACKED THEY CHANGE THE PHONE NUMBER EMAIL AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ACCES THE APP AND INSTAGRAM WILL NOT HELP YOU EVEN WHEN IS A RED FLAG THE WORD HACKED"
Privacy concern. I dont like that I cannot hide who I follow from those who follow me
No Freedom or privacy in this app. Shame on such a big app to delete anything related to the real truth
Instagram has my back. I got hacked and Instagram made it easy to reset my security info within less then 5 minutes. Ily insta
"Errooooor. Its not the first time that this app limit the frecuency of my activities to protect the community. Instagram, what happen? I sent you more than 10 times this error, but you continue. I eliminate my account. I follow just 30 accounts, and have 0 followers. Years ago I like this app because I can inform about my interests. Now,  You are toooo discusting and without reasons. Be careful world, you can lose your data"
Story info. I wanna know why I dont have the add your photo in my story but when I log into my other account I have it why isnt is on my main page and I have the iPhone XR and dont say it hasnt gotten to it yet cause I made another account just to see if it I would have it and I did just not on my main account why is that. I would like a direct answer explaining whyplease and thank you. And my phone has been updated and the app has been updated 
"Account restricted for no reason and I cannot get anyone to review it. I am unable to follow friends back, post comments on friends pictures or even post onto my private Instagram account. I have not done anything wrong and have been loyal to the app since 2013"
"Shadowban is real. We have had an account since 2013. Had a steady rate of growth and engagement up until about a year ago when we were blocked without warning for using a third party post/planning app which we started using to keep up with the changing algorithm. Now we are lucky to reach our own followers. We pay for ads, it does nothing. I have reached out to Instagram countless times to see if we have been Shadowbanned or reported, and its of course impossible to reach anyone for help on resolving this.We are a business who sells products, and the shopping feature is pointless. We have used this app as our main social media outlet because it was simple and straight forward.If youre going to be spying on our phones and tracking our activity, selling it to China, at the very least listen to your consumers when they ask for the simple chronological order back"
"No Help. My Instagram as well as many others Ive known have been hacked by Bitcoin sales people.  They are imposing as me talking to my friends as me and getting more accounts.  Instagram has zero customer service or ways to let users get any help.  So if someone hacks your account and steals your identity there is no one to stop them.  I understand it is a free app, but if theres no, like zero, policing or service help then it is unsafe"
Sad but true. Been using the app now for a while and its been on the decline. Maybe back in the day it was top of the line but now I think it is unacceptable for a few reasons the biggest being that recently theyve been allowing a lot of sexual content through their filters. For whatever reason they think its acceptable to allow pornography on an app that anyone can have(which is my main reason for deleting the app). They look into your search history and similar things to give you adds which a lot of companies will do as well. I believe this to be an invasion of privacy. They get you when they ask you to agree to the terms and service when you first download the app. They also filter and restrict political content. Now I could care less about this because I used the app to get a laugh but especially here recently Ive noticed that accounts that post political memes or say something about the wrong person get silenced while others dont. Definitely would not recommend this app to a friend. Its become some sort of bastardized thing that everyone has gotten their hand into and its now ruined
The app wont let me post. For a app that is famous not allowing a person to post on their story and deleting Eve thing the person post with the claim that they breaking community guidelines for posting my own face or comment beautiful under my friend pics and that gets deleted but actual violence of when my sister Instagram was hacked and no one helped that cant be fixed right. All I want to do is be able to post on my story and comment on my friends pictures with out it being deleted. Thé help centre is useless they dont answer nor help you
. There is no privacy
Access Data. I can't able to find Access Data option in my account since few months
safety privacy private security. brilliant works it lookings goods masks on
Facebook owned. Data mining scam. 0 stars
Hacked. My account @joetara got hacked. I cant get it recovered either. The hacker deleted my email and phone number on the account. Theres no way to get ahold of instagram or Facebook. What a crappy app. Smart nerds should be able to figure out to get another persons instagram back whose face matches the pictures. SMH do better
"#instagreat. Instagram is a great, simple and great way to stay connected socially, share your content personal or business. Thank you Instagram for a great platform, GOD bless you all, have a Happy and Safe New Year"
HellinIG. Its a fun product that just steals data fro mark Z global take over ambitions
My Instagram account has been hacked. My Instagram account was hacked yesterday and I have tried every way possible to get it back and I still cant get into it and I have tried everything that Instagram has suggested and it has not work and there is no support system that I can call to try and regain access to my account and I dont see how Facebook/Instagram can allow people personal life to just get hacked by one who lives in a different country youd think your security system would be better at protecting people personal information and I am really not happy with this at all 
Cant report Inappropriate Content. I tried to report something that had false information and it kicks me out the app
"Account got disabled. Hello, my account got disabled yesterday. On my account I had never promoted any kind of violent or ruthless behaviour, neither did I violate any community guidelines. I had just been posting photos and videos. My account had been mistakenly disabled and I would love to have my account back, as I had many data that I lost. I could not access the Instagram help centre which is why I decided to contact in this way. I hope I can get a response"
"dont care for your privacy. Instagram does NOT protect your account even though you have it under private, your profile still view by any other who is not in your contacts. If one wants to end service, it gives you a dialogue box as a salesman who wants to convince you Not to leave. I feel it is created for people to become addicted to it. As it only gives you more and more strangers profiles for one to see even though one only wants a private account. Definitely not for youth younger than 21 as their brain is not yet develop and addiction may develop"
Customer support. So I logged out from my accounts to remove an account I dont use. When I tried logging back in it asked for a code from a number that I no longer had access to. Yes I know I can change the phone number and email but even for that it asked for a code or email confirmation from that exact phone number and email too. The customer service is so bad for this type of thing. The least instagram can do is let us provide an email or phone number we have access to and send a link to reset our passwords or make it more reliable and safer to get back into our accounts. I also emailed them my info and they still came out with an unreliable email saying that it was not enough information. Theres plenty of people out there who have had trouble or no chance at all to regain their accounts back. Instagram was fine until facebook took it over
Since I downloaded this app. I have been hooked on the reels a feature offered on instagram and I have already received 3 unknown calls I have a brand new number that I havent shared with anyone yet I received one call pretending to be from amazon and another unknown number This app seems to collect a lot of data i dont know and cannot trust. Thank you instagram for ruining my day and my identity
"Instagram support is BS BEWARE. After having the same account for 7yrs My account was disabled after unfollowing 8 people. I was asked to confirm my account after that I got this message: &#34;Thanks for Providing Your Info   We&#39;ll review your info and if we can confirm it, you&#39;ll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours.&#34;   It has been longer than that and my account was still locked,  Additionally after following 10 weird menus in FB and IG I got to this option to recover my account. I requested a manual reset via Facebook and sent the information they requested and nothing has happened.   This it utter BS"
Saying goodbye. Hacking and spying on people made me take this app down. I privacy and wont work unless you have tracking on and WiFi. Harassment all day and every day. They control everything
Business vs Personal. I love Instagram but i wish my business acct would get all the perks my personal acct gets. My business acct has no new font feature?? Like what the heck. But my personal acct always gets all the new cool stuff. instagram isnt making it easier to have a cool engaging business page &amp; thats annoying. Please fix this
"Appeal Issues. I have an Instagram for my dog which is going to be deleted because shes not old enough  . I appealed the decision, and it seems the link to appeal is broken. I also replied to facebooks email for a photo ID. Its been over a week and nothing has been done yet. Then, I tried to download my data per Instagram request, but you need to log in in order to download data. So, obviously I cannot log in because I have been LOCKED OUT of my dogs account because shes not old enough. I mean, what the heck is going on here? Theres no customer service or human to speak to about this. Years of photo memories of my dog gone to waste now. Unbelievable"
"STOP THE STUPID UPDATES. I have been using insta when it was like brown. I have been there throughout its update and stuff. But they need to stop this stupid updates. Since the platform is used more now, they dont care about users review . I hate the new update. The whole profile looks ugly and I cant even like pictures/save things. Im blocked from this actions. One more stupid update and Im done with this app  SECONDLY FIX THE STUPID BUGS. I own 2 accounts and insta is sending notifications to all my friends whenever I open a new account, isnt that leaking someones privacy? This platform is so stupid. You all got workers SO GET TO WORK"
"New update is trash, and so is the algorithm. Instagram is far from what it used to be. The apps main purpose was to post and share your creativity and personal moments, now all the app is is a SHOPPING APP. The new algorithm is trash. I honestly see more advertisements to buy random stuff than my friends/families actual posts. Also, Instagrams recent new update reels is absolutely horrible. Its like theyre trying to become the new TikTok on top of it, I rarely even use this app anymore and Ill probably delete it once they come out with another horrible update. If I could go back to the Instagram we had 4-5 years ago I would, all these updates are doing is ruining the app"
"Always, the best one. Everybody needs privacy. The best apps to be virtually active, and being safe"
Invasion of my privacy. I have not given this app permission to access my contacts yet people I know keep creeping up. Totally invasive. Zuckerberg kills privacy
"Enjoy Instagram. Love Instagram for personal reasons, but for my business account as well"
"Still no help. Instagram is obviously a well known app; however, its not consistent. I have two accounts: one personal and one for my non-profit. My personal account allows my followers to repost my stories; however, my non-profit account does not. Its crucial that my non-profit has this capability as Id like my followers to spread the word or allow sponsors to repost my stories. Please rectify this issue"
The new terms of use. They literally can spy on us now. We cant even sue them. Delete the app
More Instagram in 2021. Im an old guy 50+ just learning how to use Instagram for personal and business use
"Tired of the BS. Instagram literally wont let me log into my account. Ive had an account for years, and it keeps showing a please try again message. I am so disappointed and am thinking about deleting my account forever if they dont let me access my own data. Total BS"
idk its all cool until video chat. The video chatting is HORRIBLE. Even the sending takes ages Its not my wifi I even tried on mobile data but the same thing happens. Instagram is getting worse
Since January 2020 (4months now) HELP. It has been 4 months since I realized I was unable to update my Instagram bio &amp; profile picture. It says &#34;ERROR. Sorry we couldn&#39;t update you profile picture. Please confirm you have internet connection and try again in a moment.&#34; After research I tried everything. -updating app several times (whenever new was available)- deleting &amp; re starting phone -logging out &amp; back in - clearing cache - LOGGING IN ON A DIFFERENT PHONE (My boyfriend was able to change his but when we switched to mine on his phone it says same problem) -TRIED RESTARTING WIFI &amp; using data. - emailing several times with no help / response When will Instagram decide to help their users &amp; open a call center that works / email that responds? This is just getting ridiculous
Im not giving my info out. I downloaded Instagram and I downloaded it and when I tried to download it again it keeps on asking me for my billing info and I dont want to give it out and Im wondering if I have to pay to download it again
Horrible security & help. My account has been hacked into once and someone keeps attempting to hack into it and now my account is disabled? I dont understand why Instagram doesnt have a better strategy when it comes to their users information getting hacked it feels like we are the ones punished for it because all we get is an email saying to explain the situation and then wait for 24 hours? There is no way to talk to someone directly as I sit here and freak out that I dont have access for something I need to use for my work. Instagram needs to fix their weak security and also provide better customer service to users whos accounts are compromised. This is the worst feeling and I no longer feel safe using this app
"Biased. This app is really biased. Its disappointing to see that the creators of this app insert their political opinion when they arent asked for it. If one of their original intentions was to be an app in which people could share their photos and like each others posts, they should probably stick to that. Every time I try to look at posts they are constantly pushing the covid vaccine on me. Im just trying to scroll through the app and look at posts and theyre constantly pushing facts about the cdc and info links to get vaccinated. Like when did I ask? If I needed this information, then Id simply Google it. Its honestly really disturbing to see that this all being forced onto everyone by putting it in our faces every single day through social media.Im logging out and deleting the app because its concerning to see that our media is being directed towards certain viewpoints or topics. This is supposed to be an unbiased place where we can connect with friends and family without needing to be bombarded with vaccination information. If you love the vaccine so much, why not use all your efforts to force this down out throats, to create a whole new app dedicated to the vaccine (since theres so much you got to say)"
Theres better things to do in life. Plus theyre platform is designed to make you addicted and steal your data
Dont download. Instagram gets hacked easily and really isnt worth your time. If you have to get social media get Snapchat or twitter. Instagram is laggy and buggy and if you have any information on it you are 100% going to get hacked
"Only working with Wifi. For the past week I havent been able to use the app when I am not connected to Wi-Fi. The rest of my apps work perfectly with my data plan but Instagram, I have erased it and downloaded it again and thats not working either"
"Instagood. What can I say? It&#39;s Instagram You can create as many profiles as you want ; personal, business, private. Come up with the best AND worst hashtags. Stalk (I mean follow) all the celebrities (or normal people) you want Possibilities are endless As of right now, only thing I would wanna change is all of the &#34;buttons&#34; at the bottom of the page. I liked it better when it only had the homepage, search, notifications, &amp; profile. Now it&#39;s way more than what I use so it gets confusing"
"Where is the support?. Great app but I am not being allowed to log in due to a bug and there is no support for Instagram users No email address or phone number to contact So I cant access my account at all, so one star until I can use it again"
"No support. I enjoy the app. However security is an issue. After attempted hacks I set up two-step authentication, but when my phone was lost and I needed to set up IV on my new phoneI was unable to get into my accounts without access to my two-step authentication. It took weeks, no support. I finally found my old phone and was able to turn it on long enough to get access. Instagram needs customer support. Irresponsible not to"
Instagram is a snitch. Im trying to make another spam account so my family wont follow me because i want my own privacy. Instagram decided to put an update that allows people to see that your friend is on instagram as ___ They dont even have a switch button it settings to turn it off or anything. I just think this is stupid
Do you steal data. But i like it
The Best Site Ever. Instagram is just awesome If you like photos and fantastic posts and opportunities to interact with people from not only around the world but also in your own backyard? Then you need to be here Its user friendly so theres not a big learning curve Whether for personal or business- its your go to app #weheartinstagram #instaphotos #instaposts #justdoit #bestappever
"Account Hacked & No Customer Support. My Instagrams account was hacked WHILE I WAS USING IT. They changed my password, removed my email, and phone number. All of the instructions listed in the Help Center either dont work OR dont offer all of the solutions listed. I have had many of my followers report my account as well as I have and not one word from IG Supports. How can you allow hackers to infiltrate our accounts and invade our privacy like this without any resolve. But if I type a word that goes against community guidelines Im immediate addressed. I only have 2 stars to see if this will actually post. Be aware users bitcoin hackers are on the prowl and IG does not care at all"
Very bias. Deletes and conceals posts and stories based on their personal agendaVery disappointing
New Setup is Horrible. Long time user really frustrated with the new changes to the interface Orienting away from posting at all and moving toward optimizing for ads has finally reached its pinnacle. I was wondering how long it would take for Facebook to ruin Insta like it did its own interface. Thanks for making the interface un-understandable and overly complicated and basically useless if youre trying to use it consciously and for a personal photo account
"IG Wants To Be TikTok So Bad. The IG UX has been extremely degraded with this new UI. Do you know how long it took me to realize how to add a photo? And Reels? Its practically a middleware for your TikToks.On top of that, Im seeing ads every 2 posts. Even when I hide an ad as not relevant, I get similar ads. Also everything is out of order; Im seeing stuff IG *thinks* I want to see...which Im not sure what kind of data analytics theyre doing but its not working.The things I used to enjoy about IG have practically been stripped away. I wouldve much prefered they just made a different app for Reels and Shops or whatever Facebook wants them to call it"
Fix it ASAP becuase the person keeps posting my personal info. I cant report anything it says report something but when I click on whatever Im reporting about its says report in help center and it doesnt have an option to report and I need it ASAP becuase she keeps posting my personal info
Help add yours feature not working for some folks. I have a business instagram and it works but the same feature doesnt work on my personal
"One star is too Generous. This app used to be great before it merged with Facebook. My account got hacked and for months I have been trying to get it back. I have went through all the articles on how to retrieve a hacked Instagram but none of them are really helpful. I have done everything- sent a login link, tried going through my phone number, sent a video for confirmation that it was my account and I am who I say I am. But the problem is that the hackers took over everything. They changed the email in the Instagram settings to theirs so every time I now try to login or change my password to even just log them out- NOTHING. I have had friends message me and say the same thing, that their account was hacked, because now it is too easy. I lost everything. The pictures of my grandma who is no longer with us, conversation with people that I wont ever get back, a much more"
"CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Please change it back to chronological order, I&#39;ve not only missed a bunch of posts and things but now there is a massive wave of other suggested posts and products. the only reason i still have this app is nostalgia and personal hoarding of my own pictures. The new updates are just making instagram worse and worse, and soon i think itll phase out of popularity"
Will not share to Facebook. Instagram refuses to post to Facebook even when all share to Facebook options are checked as yes. Please put the notifications and the messages back to where the used to be It is SO confusing and SO much harder to go to notifications. The screen will not slide over into the notifications like it used to with messages. It will have a constant red dot until you go into it which sometimes it refuses to do also
"INSTAGRAM MUSIC DOESNT WORK WHEN ON MOBILE DATA. Is it just me or when I use mobile data, Instagram music wont work? I use AT&T LTE by the way.. There is no update available for me I hope I am not the only one"
Well done Instagram but step it up with the cheap ads. Tired of Instagram just shelling out advertisements for cheap companies. Dig deeper with the data that you take and recognize the users who are tired of seeing the same type of advertisements from contemptible companies
More privacy. I would love this app way more if they had a feature like face book where you can block certain people from seeing certain posts. Or the restricted button meant cant see any new posts but you can see past posts from a certain time
Well I dont know if it just me. I have two different accounts one for business and one for personal. I have not seen this issue before but Im on Instagram often meaning I like a lot see people I recognise and follow them however I keep getting a limit on it and I understand its to prevent spams but i dont know when to come back on because it doesnt give me a time span its up to Instagram is kinda the only career I have so I hope u fix this issue because it will cause me a huge problem if not fixed just need a time span thats all
"Instagram disabling and deactivating accounts. Instagram has been deactivating and disabling accounts for no reason what-so-ever and has been making it increasingly harder to avale to reactivate or even contact them. Poor poor customer service for a company that benefit immensely from our data collection and ad targeting.I work for marketing agency that handles many accounts and we know the ins and outs of IG but just recently my personal instagram account @mrgmolano has wrongfully been deactivated for no apparent reason, I am a bit confused in what way or form I have broken any rules. My account is in no way controversial, political, offensive, inappropriate  or indecent. None of my photos, videos or captions have broken any of Instagrams guidelines. All my content is about travel, life experiences and motivational quotes. I have worked really hard to organically grow my following and have never bought any followers or likes or comments but rather I have INVESTED in promoting and boosting some of my images and content with Instagram and the Facebook Ad company. I feel it has been unfairly targeted because maybe in the location Ive visited (TURKEY) or because my content is being featured in other IG accounts (because of the great work I do) and have started to gain traction with a new group of following (travel and adventure).SHAME ON YOU IG"
Instagram spies on me. Instagram spies on me and listens to my voice
"Picture layout. As we do not receive pictures from our followers in order of them posting, we should be allowed to move pictures around as we post them. So we can press on the pictures that we have posted over time and put them in an order that we would like so our feed can look nice according to everyones personal taste. Thank you"
My Account Hacked and IG didnt do nothing about it. If it has 0 stars I would put zero rating Im not able to login and recover my account the hacker changed my information and Instagram wont do nothing about it cause it doesnt go against their community guidelines and posting false information
"I like the app but sooooo many problems. My issues:-Automatic videos playing on data even when disabled- I had to disable data through my phone network for Instagram on cellular or I eat thru 5 gb in 15 days.-No longer look at feed except first couple picks due to algorithm that doesnt show me the most recent pictures first, from everyone I subscribe to. I use stories instead.- Weird/bug of phantom notifications- Segmenting and hiding chats from anonymous people in an other box- Accepting advertising from spam/scam artists. Found multiple ads that were verifiable scams and despite reporting many times, went unremoved"
My feed wont refresh. Ive had instagram since 2013 and all of a sudden everything else works but my timeline. Im logged into other accounts and they work just fine but mine just doesnt seem to work. I have excellent WiFi connection as well as data. Its upsetting me due to the fact that I have had this account for so long
"HATE THE UPDATE. Why do I have to allow Instagram to my full camera roll to have access to reels??? I shouldnt have updated it, NO PRIVACY THROUGH META"
"Randomly deleted account. My account was disabled suddenly without warning, and for no reason (no terms of use breached). Unable to appeal, and also in breach of GDPR I am offered no way of getting access to my data held by Instagram"
Advertisement. Can I please stop seeing voter information and Covid info I am an educated person and do not need a social media site telling me biased information with no fact I come here for entertainment not you opinion on anything
spying. in ios 14 it shows you if an app is using your cam and guess what when i use the app its always on even if im not taking a picture
Instagram support. Its so hard to understand how to contact instagram support when someone has hacked your page still no response from instagram smh just terrible they need a support email that we can have access too
This update screwed my insta up. I can no longer view my notifications when someone comments or likes my pictures
"IG is horrible. Users need more control on their accounts.Theres a ton of SPAM &amp; fake accountsAlso, after the update, I get banner/notifications of people to follow. NO Instagram I dont want that nor the stupid notificationsAlso, I have all my notifications clicked to off in the settings &amp; I still get notifications for pages I dont follow Need to fix"
"Data harvesting. Wont let me create an account/log in without my phone number.Guys, youre a mere looking-at-photos app. You do not need to text me"
"I cannot access messages or post stories. Since the update Ive not been able to access my business messages or post stories, Ive reported it several times but no one has helped- its really affecting my small business. It doesnt load at all but my personal Instagram is absolutely fine"
Deleting comments. Its soooo Ridiculous that business accounts can remove and delete comments under their posts. I get it if personal accounts are able to do this because it Hurts their feelings. But Businesses accounts?In countries that doesnt have a right to free speech social medias are the only place that we can protest about their services. But you banned this option for what exactly???You are helping bad people. Busses accounts should not have a right to delete comments they doesnt like. The report option is not enough for making it a safe place for every one in case someone says something disrespectful???
"This is the best app. I love this app I love posting pictures, I consider Instagram like my personal journal. I love the social media networking and marketing part of it. I will choose this app over Facebook any day"
Too much credits to this app. I wouldnt give even one star to this application but I had to write my review. I dont feel so comfortable using this app anymore. instagram suggested stories are disturbing I dont understand whats based on but I never liked or viewed such a terrible posts but it kept showing up in my account. We get lot of unwanted tags and spam messages in our personal account dm. Support team is totally unhelpful and I can say even disrespectful. Instagram is a spying application I didnt allow location access in this app but it shows related posts on zone native language and viral videos this is really annoying. Im asking everyone lets put this app down this is the time
Just another link in the chain. Just like FB - no privacy- funny reels to get you locked into watching mindless stuff. But learn something NOPE- privacy? NOPE
"Fix your app. Im always having problems with instagram, its always saying im having a connection problem or it cant log me in at this time even though other apps are working, constant glitches. Plus its owned by facebook so it tracks your data"
Review. Too many restrictions and too lack of information in how to handle the IGNeed more info to avoid the blocks and restrictions and more ways to be legally powerful in my business through IG Where can I get that please?
"Psychos. There is absolute ZERO need for tracking peoples sensitive info and every single phone use Creepy, psycho capitalists. Waiting for your prosecution Zuck. How many times have you lied to congress now- directly or by omission, Zuck? Too many"
HELP. For some reason my personal Instagram account (in the USA) I previously could download current music for my ig stories. Now I have access to nothing but peoples music from other countries What do I do to fix this?????
"Instagram password support is trash. The help center in particular is useless if youve been hacked. Like a bot that doesnt understand what is needed, it keeps you in a loop. Im thinking filling out the form Id hear from someone, but nope. I finally broke down and started a new page after a week. My page was over 6 year old . Bottom line do better. Even Gmail asks what are some previous passwords you remember before allowing a change. My hacker set up two factor after hacking me, how do I know? Instagram emailed me that info and the reverse changes link never worked, making it impossible for me to get in without assistance"
New terms and condition are horrible. It violates the constitution and our right to privacy Will delete Not okay
"They locked me out of my account. Im rewriting this review bc it looks like my last one got deleted, but a couple years back a friend of mine managed to get my login, and instagram flagged it when he logged into my account. It then locked ME out of the account, and because I changed my phone number since making the 5-6 year old photography account (which is still the only place I have all the photos Ive taken stored), they wouldnt let me log back in. For some reason my number was the only security info they had and no matter who I contacted or what I tried, even messaging the old number to see if anyone else had it, I could never get my account back. Havent used the app since, and would advise against it bc that was a lot of time devoted to posting and editing my pictures to just lose all of em"
Spyware. Too many unrelated ads. Too much spam. Too much tracking of my personal life. Get out of my biz
Fake accounts. Wayyy too many fake accounts on here stealing peoples info/pictures etc. Needs to be monitored better
"Love Instagram but now . For several months I havent been able to tag any photos in my personal profile or my business profile  its a big problem . Ive also send several messages  cause thats the only way to report a problem  and no one has reach out . Its been about 6 months with the same problem . Deleting app , updating and nothing works. Maybe someone here can help"
"Used to be a personal app, now its all news politics influencers and business. Used to be a good app, back before 2013. Now its a joke"
Has potential. But the execution is awful. The instagram team wrongly bans accounts right and left. Building a following exclusively on this platform is highly foolish. There is great potential for other platforms to perfect what instagram tries to do. Update: this app gets worse with every update. They recently took away the in-app option to select the photos you want the app to have access to. A sneaky way to force users to give access to all photos again. Apple should punish apps that attempt to circumvent security and privacy measures
No stealy information. Stop tqking my info
Hacked. Personal account was hacked and good luck getting it back because Instagram doesnt seem to care or do anything to help you get it back
The best social media app. Hey Instagram I just want to say wow what a amazing social media app one of the best 10/10  If you could do offline using it will be a bit better for those people who dont have data But apart from that one of the best social media. 
"Make CHANGES READ THIS Fully. Instagram what is happening with your mute. I muted people from seeing my posts and they can still see my posts.Make changes or your app will be the same as Facebook where no one likes it anymore. You should (by should I mean you have to) get rid of influencer models. Theyre terrible for young girls and young adults ,ruins mental and physical health of others. Instagram models make young teenagers and even adults look at their body differently and want to change how they look so they look like a model. Models are pathetic and Instagram will be way better without them all. Instagram influenced models isnt a job at all. The body of these models make young teens and even young adults in their twenties to change the way they look next thing they become shinny like a stick a  anorexia is that supposed to be healthy? No, I demand Instagram influencer models to all be gone.Instagram I keep getting messages from people who have the +18 nudity picture I report them and nothing happens I want be way to report the messages so their account can be removed. This is Instagram not a place for people looking for sex or porn. Make changes now.Instagram stop using shadow ghosts for IP addresses youre invading peoples privacy"
"Oddly difficult to use. Oddly restrictive guidelines. First off, as a young adult Id say Im tech savvy, yet this app is confusing to use. Why? Please do better. Second, your guidelines say  We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities. So to criticize a PUBLIC figure, like a politician, by saying they are a coward for turning off their comments so they can ignore the criticism, and keep their page clean, should be perfectly within your guidelines. Please get better. Being able to call out politicians for their cowardliness and faults is a crucially important part of the internet. Thirdly, if my comments only post 1/5 of the time, at least let me copy the text, or set an option to copy a message to clipboard if it doesnt send. Lastly, why are you silencing the war crimes against Palestinians? Why are you censoring people? Why are you against humanity?"
"Refusing to block spam accounts. I regularly get inappropriate spam follower requests from pages requesting I instead head to their Snapchat or other social media pages. I keep reporting these to Instagram, but Instagram replies back and insists that these pages arent violating the terms of service. If this is the type of community they idealize and want to foster, then whatever. But theyd better stop acting like theyre striving to provide a safe and inclusive community"
"Instagram Deleted Content after Disabling. My handle is @istyleismileHi can I please get support for my issue? Ive sent multiple messages since thanksgiving about Instagram deleting my photos while my account was deactivated. Please helpIve never had photos or videos removed for violating any terms and my account has been hacked. In August 2019 I deactivated my account to take a break. I read the terms which stated that I could reactivate my account at any time and my content would be preserved. However in November 2019 when I came back I noticed that all of my pictures have been deleted. Please, Ive had multiple accounts with you representing my business and personal interests over the years and have never had this problem. my grandmother who has since passed on and a host of other memories that have now been lost with these changes. If anything can be done I would appreciate if you could restore my account. Ive read that this is happened to other accounts who have deactivated temporarily, and once they contacted Instagram the issue was resolved. However ironically each support request that Ive sent through my account have gone unanswered. If someone could kindly please get back to me I would greatly appreciate it thank you"
"Absolutely Useless. My account was recently hacked, and the username, password and contact information were changed. When attempting to report this issue and regain access to my account, there was no way to contact Instagram in a productive way, and no clear resolution to this problem. Their help line is absolutely useless and there is no actual way to contact Instagram to receive any sort of help for an issue like this. Do better"
"App wise its 5 stars. Instagram wise- its 3 stars. Ive never had glitches. But this app has gotten bad. Their reporting team needs to be fired. Ive received death threats, and when I reported them, they said nothing was wrong. I use it for my business but my personal account is private. Extremely disappointing"
"Ummm. I really love Instagram. There are just a few things I would want gone. 1. Ringtone. I use an iPhone and when someone texts me or just get a notification, the ringtone gets really annoying. I want to be able to change the sound of the ringtone to my liking. 2. HackersMy account got hacked not to long ago, and they deleted my account. Hopefully you can change the privacy on Instagram. 3. Weirdos Okay so they are these random people I believe a bunch of girls/females ran into. And  me saying this, they are funny. But at least get rid of those people. I really enjoy the app. Nothings really wrong with it, and I have my own opinions"
Hacked account. Instagram doesnt have any kind of contact info to ask them to help you get your account back if it has been hacked
"Spyware. Regardless of what permissions are enabled, this software seems able to bypass privacy and security settings to collect whatever data it wants"
Latest update is unusable. I am no longer able select photos frommy camera roll without giving this terrible app full access to my entire role. Every update erodes my user privacy. I may very well leave Instagram again Fix this
"IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE. Ever since Facebook took over, everything started getting worse; day by day we suffer through constant terrible UI updates and their cash grab reels which has the soul purpose of getting you stuck in the reels tab to generate views for whatevers trending (almost everything trending with these guys are just foolish acts of retardation and is a waste of time) NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY STEAL ALL YOUR DATA TO SELL ONLINE.What a god awful app. With the way things are going I might just fix it myself at their head quarters one day. If you know what I mean"
Instagram doesnt care if you get hacked. I got hacked in November and have emailed instagram numerous times with no response. If your account gets hacked by people who are literally stealing your information and money instagram doesnt care at all. Ive had so many people get their money stolen as a result of trusting that my account is me when its actually hackers. Instagram needs to implement a system to help get accounts back
"Connect with old and new friends globally. Enjoy sharing photos, quotes and messages on Instagram which emphasizes inspiration and personal celebrations and stories"
"Fake account using my information. I reported an account after it was brought to my attention that someone was using my name and pictures to scam women on Instagram. I received feedback from Instagram this afternoon saying, they cant remove the account because it doesnt go against the community guidelines and that they werent violating anything. Interesting how I report it saying theyre pretending to be me but that somehow doesnt go against instagrams guidelines. So needless to say, you guys dont really seem to be concerned about trying to keep Instagram a safe place. So since yall dont want to do anything about it I guess Ill spread the word to women interested in making an account halestorm1122 is a fake account and theyre attempting to scam you and Instagram doesnt want to do anything about it. My account is now on private in hopes they cant get anymore of my pictures"
Insta removed a hero. Instagram have a bad privacy It removed our hero picture And then deactivated our pageQasem Soleimani was our hero
"Account troubles. Like many people, I have a public and a private account. I am not able to post content in my personal account. Whatever Instagram did with their recent update affected available features to both accounts. You can manage photos in one account but not the other. Please fix what was not broken, prior to your update"
"Love Instagram. I love Instagram its not as personal as Facebook , its more about the people without getting in their face .  Its great to perve on, so to speak. I love the creativity on Instagram different lenses. Its funky &amp; fun"
Wish I could do 0. How about u get a support team for hacked accounts. Worst social media platform once issues arise. Because they simply do not care about you privacy or protection and how to help
Facebook has destroyed IG. Facebook has destroyed what was an awesome app by turning it into just another manifestation of Facebook. What was a great place for family and friends has been polluted into just another marketing tool to sell stuff and scrape personal info
"UI/UX. The new layout and intention of Instagram has shifted from a personal/user friendly experience to a money grabbing, shopping app that does the opposite of advertised. I have not seen a single post from people i personally know in months and i only see ads and famous peoples posts"
"Take Action. Protect your mental health, social life and privacy and delete this app"
"Review of Instagram Account HelloMyLoveStudios. Hi there, I have written and messaged, and searched everywhere online for a solution. My business account does not let me post to my stories. I can not share images or posts from my own page or my news feed to my stories and it is having an extremely negative effect for my business. I am able to do it on my personal Instagram and I have tried to re-install the app. This has been incredibly frustrating Please could this be fixed??Thank you"
Wont let me log back in. Instagram log me out of one of my accounts... and now wont let me back in I had to send proof of who I was by holding a piece of paper with a number written on it and they are saying the photo is not acceptable to give me access back but wont tell me what is acceptable though However it is letting me post from my Facebook page to my Instagram account 
Trying to force users to allow access to all photos. When I use the app I always select and manage what photos I use since the rollout of that option. All my other apps work fine. Instagram does not. I install the app then select which photos I want. After that the manage photos button disappears and I can no longer add photos to the instagram photo roll from my photo library. The only ways to fix this are to allow all photo access or uninstall and reinstall everytime I want to post something. The apple vs FB war over our data is trash and so is instagram&#39;s tactics to force me to allow them access to all my photos. So I would not recommend. Apple needs to fix this
Prone to hacking. I would hear reports of people after people being hacked and ignored it until it happened to me. Instagram provides little support to resolve it and all your posts and messages become property of the hacker. Your followers become vulnerable thinking its still your account when IG refuses to remove the compromised account
No help for hacked account. My account was hacked and no one answered. I had pictures of my baby and Instagram didnt understand the danger because they never helped get my account back. It was hacked and they changed my email my password and started sending messages to my followers. Thankfully I alerted some of my friends whos phone numbers I had and I told them to block and report them. Yet with all the reports they sent my hacked account is still open and the hacker is doing who knows what with it. Im very disappointed with Instagram and lack of care it has for us
I was hacked and Instagram is not helping. I have been an Instagram user since 2013. I have trusted Instagram with many of my personal memories. I recently got hacked and I have not received any help from Instagram. I would think that once entrust such famous and rich app you would get more assistance but I have not. It has been very disappointing because Instagram is allowing it to happen
"Hacked and Lost account. Disappointed and worried for my privacy   I have been hacked and I have not been able to secure my account.  I went thru the steps hoping to secure my account to no avail.  At every attempt, Instagram continues to send my info and link to the hacker.  No customer service. No phone contact.Poor security process. Unbelievable that our accounts are so easily lost. My photography business was depended on my Instagram account. Ive lost all my photos and business contacts"
Keeps your data. Im trying to delete my Instagram accounts I dont use anymore but every time I reinstall the app it remembers all my accounts. Im trying to log out of them but it never logs out once I click log out. Why is this so broken?
Ask me a question feature. Please dont sell my data
Why the suggested pages on tl. I dont understand why Instagram changed its outline. Now on my timeline Ill get suggested pages and people to follow on my personal timeline. Its honestly annoying. Isnt that what the discover page is for? Not to be on a persons personal time line
"Need more privacy features. Instagram, can you please add a feature of hiding following and followers and mutual followers? The same way its there on Facebook"
"Doesnt work dont know why. So recently my data was suspended and then turned back on. Instagram posts and stories would load and I would be able to see them before. Now, nothing loads at all I cant see anything and when messages are sent or received I get the notification for it before I see it pop up in my dms. I have to refresh dms for the message to pop up. Before, I would give instagram a 5 star, but now its a one star because nothing works"
I Dont like. I dont like that Im forced to use Facebook if I want to pay promotional ads because Facebook can make creating an account extremely difficult for a business person who wants to separate business from personal accounts
Not enough. Not enough privacy features
Reporting should include ability to comment. I love that I report actual racism and false information. Yet I get responses back that they refuse to take the posts down because its a global community. And feel that people should express themselves freely. I didnt know misinformation and hate speech is considered ok. Absolutely disgusting
"Instagram is crap. Never remembers my login. Sometimes freeze. And, sometimes cant logon without shutting down my phone and restarting it. Cant login over cellular data"
Innovative. Instagram has helped me learn more about myself. Where I want to go.Where I came from and what we can do to make a difference. I personally began this as my own personal timeline when the product was launched thank you for reminding of beautiful life
"Update to Newsfeed is Awful. I HATE what they did to the newsfeed in the most recent update. For those of you who dont know, havent realized, or havent updated yet, when you scroll through your feed and see the last of the new posts, Instagram starts to show you posts from your search feed, rather than the older posts from your feed. You can click see older posts to go to a newsfeed which strictly shows posts youve already seen. Its not that I just LOVE re-visiting posts Ive already seen, but this update not only makes the newsfeed feel clunky, but also forces a feature on me that I dont want, and honestly feels a little bit like an invasion of privacy. I follow who I want to follow and thats what I expect to see in my feed. If I am interested in exploring more, Ill go to the explore tab - THATS WHAT IT IS FOR. At the very least, please introduce a way to turn this feature off. Until then, 2 stars"
"Nothing loads on this app. Oh look its me trying to peacefully scroll through Instagram. Oh wow thats an interesting post, lets look at the comments. Oh wait THEY DONT LOAD. I constantly try to watch videos and look at comments on this app and it never loads and I know its not my WiFi because it doesnt work when I change to my data either. Fix your app to make it enjoyable for people. I know others experience the same thing. Fix it"
"Feels safe, really isnt. When it was a start-up, this was a safe way to share images. Now its just another tentacle in the great big data thieving octopus of social media, forcing you to interact with vapid brain-dead influences, misleading advertising, and the loss of all of your privacy.So enjoy the pretty pictures, but be acutely aware of what it truly costs to use a free service like this"
Not worth it. Cant ever see your notifications. App never works right. They also listen to your conversations and show you things you talk about in advertising
terrible. they are spying on you. collecting personal information from you
"Live chat. Hey Instagram, your app is good. Only thing I ask is to make it possible to be able to go live without seeing comment. They really distract Not only that, can we archive lives, videos and reel ?Not only that, we need a private place only, the user can see. Like on Snapchat"
In America its free. Instagram has stolen all my pictures and videos from my original Instagram and refuses to make contact back with me to retrieve them. I wonder how many fake pages are being opened up with those photos who only their engineers have access too. Pretty weird theyre mine soooo
Garbage Help Center. Got hacked earlier this year and since i got my account back i havent been able to change my profile picture or change my account name from what the hacker had changed it too. Instagram has no contact center for help nor solutions for it online
"Not Worth Your Time. If you are looking to get your account hacked then this app is for you, but if your not looking to have your account hacked I would say dont do it. I have loved instagram since 2012 but lately my opinion of the app has changed. I constantly get tagged in inappropriate pictures by accounts that I dont follow, and accounts that dont follow me. These accounts are trying to hack my instagram. Instagram will do absolutely nothing about this because they only care about celebrities and influencers. Even if you try to reach out to them over instagram or by phone there is no use because they will not answer you. Maybe if they made a feature that wont let accounts that dont have any association with your account not be able to tag you in pictures (if your account is private) then there would be less problems. I know 25 people who are having the same problem as me, and theres been no change. My review is also probably a waste of time because they wont do anything about it. So all I can say is good luck no getting hacked "
"so disappointed with Instagram, its going down. Instagram has been censoring freedom of speech, but yet approving provocative things. My personal account & as well as my business like crazy. No exaggeration. The algorithm has basically put a lot of people into jeopardy. Instagram has been asking money for your posts to go viral, but yet only a few look at it... Ive been an Instagram user since the beginning & its going soon going to go down the drain, cause of their rules & regulations"
"Return me Add post to story feature. It is a shame of Instagram to allow us to use the Add post to story feature ONLY with shopping/big brands. Think about small business/creators/artists who cant afford that much engagement. This feature helps them to spread their works more widely but you restrict us from using that???? Please bring it back ASAP. If you wanna secure our privacy, maybe stop eavesdropping us first? ;)"
0 customer serves/support. My personal page was hacked over a week ago. Ive emailed so many times and have gotten no responses. This person not only hacked my email but changed the email associated with it. They are posting spam and scam post on my story and have access to photos of my kids. Instagram does not take things like this serious enough for me. I cant get my old page back I will no longer use Instagram as a social media platform
"Amazing. I completely love Insta Its a really well made social media for anyone to use. I could probably go in for days talking about how good this app is for me. Even thought I dont go on it often, I still love it so much I consider getting Instagram because you can share things about what your doing and post dog pictures (like I do). I mostly most my doggo Teddy. But anyway, this app is incredible and made very well x"
"Won't help you if your account gets hacked. I recently had somebody get into my Facebook and through that they were able to get into my Instagram. As I was securing my Facebook they changed all of my info and took of two factor authentication. By the time I went to Resecure my account it was already too late, now who ever has my account is messaging my followers asking for money on my behalf,Meanwhile they have blocked me and any other friend who have brought up the fact that I am no longer in control of my account"
One feature I really want. Im not going to get to into detail but one thing I really want is more profile customisation like more info you can display on ur page e.c.t but otherwise I love it
"Gets worse and worse with each update. Instagrams problem is that it tries way too hard to copy other popular social media apps and be competitive, to the point where the app is super bloated and overcomplicated now. They add way too many new features that are dumb, no one cares about and affect other features that have been on the app forever and people really like. Instagram needs to focus on being a photo and video sharing app and stop trying to jam pack the features of all social media platforms into one app. Before 2019-2020, the app was always really good, the chronological to algorithmic feed change was annoying but besides that the app was perfect, it had an easy interface and made it super simple, quick and easy to post pictures and videos for your friends, now its getting more awful with each update. The only reason I still use Instagram is because theres no good alternative and everyone uses it, I cant wait for this app to die. It has so many unnecessary and useless new features that end up making the app super bloated and over complicated and mess up the features people have already known and loved for a really long time"
Very disappointed. My account was hacked I notified Instagram and all I got was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. If you cant secure someones account why would you expect them to Link their accounts quit financial information at risk. Their Instagram do your job? This is why a lot of people including Congress is looking into putting restrictions on you. You care by your way out.. investigate and take action.#StopHacker im sure this will be able see see the light of day
"Profile Picture and hacked account. Im able too use the app and everything but for some reason I was able Roos eat my profile picture once and never was able too change it again. Literally have done everything on google and reporting it too the help centre nothing. Also, got my other account hacked, did the whole process of sending a photo of myself with a specific code the Insta team sent me and NOTHING. I would give ZERO stars, but since I cant I have you a ONE"
"User Friendly - Until Its Not (0 customer service support). Ive used Instagram for so many years and have had a great experience, until one day my account was part of a phishing hack. Instagram locked my account until I could verify my identity. The email I had been using was one I havent had access to for years, but it never crossed my mind because I hadnt had any issues. I found that you can use a facial video to submit to Instagram to prove its your identity. However, when I would submit the video and they proved it was me, they never unlocked my account even though they claim I should be able to access it. I provided a new email each time I submitted the video so that I would gain access properly, but when I would get access, it would always say locked and that I had to get a code from that old email. The whole recovery process is less than ideal and did not work. Theres no one to speak to to resolve the issues so the customer service is obsolete. Im very disappointed to lose all saved posts and posts of my own that Id been collecting for years and years"
"Society, Please Wake Up. When is everyone going to open up their eyes, and see whats wrong with all these platforms Delete Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Youtube, FACEBOOK Take back your lives, take back your freedom, take back your PRIVACY. DELETE IT BEFORE IT DELETES ITSELF, BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"
"All the kids seem to be using this. I am a Facebook guy, but I am noticing a trend towards people posting more things on Instagram and Tik Tok. Tried Tik Tok and was uncomfortable with it because I didnt feel like shooting videos of myself all day, but Instagram has been pleasantly easy to use and the tags seem to track a little better than Facebook"
"Cant post anything?. Instagram wont let me upload anything. I tried posting the same thing on my friends phone and it didnt work there either. I tried posting just the one video in case posting multiple was the issue... still nothing. Tried uploading on 4G... nothing. My app is up to date so I dont know whats the problem. Is this a bug? Other than that, I liked Instagram. BUT the updated policies on privacy and nudity etc. are really violating and controlling. NWO kinda shi Not impressed. When a new app without censorship rolls out, youll know where to find me... and the rest of us "
"Bug???   . Well to start, Instagram deleted a video post of mine and in trying to get it back I deleted the app just to clear everything. When I went to download it again it restricts me from going past putting in my billing information- why? Isnt that only for app thats cost money? Now I cant log into the app anymore. What does this mean?"
"Better privacy controls. It would be nice to decide on a post by post basis whether that post is public or private. Or, at the very least, that the people you tag could see your posts to a private account even if they don&#39;t follow you"
Insta is great but. Would like it if you could share videos from instagram to outside of Instagram... this makes me mad cos lot of my friends I dont want to share it with them on there for privacy reasons. More user friendly would be nice
"Targeting. Im getting a personal targeted ads and tubes on instagram and YouTube, And sometimes I find that accounts are blocked on my block list especially on my old accounts, I dont know if its you or our government or the psychopaths in dubai who are sending a political threatening videos of saddam and his daughter to me which has no connection with my searches and my history, I cant live with my privacy been hacked, thank you for reading it"
Wont repost my pictures. I have none of my privacy settings on and people still cant repost my pictures
"Was much better before Facebook. Facebook owning this app will kill it for sure. As soon as anyone comes out with something new everyone will fly away just as fast as they did on Facebook. Lack of privacy, unending train of ads and tracking trying to sell us everything every three posts. Gonna die, watch. Todays generation doesn&#39;t care what they use, as long as they arent beat over the head with crap like that. It will happen, guaranteed"
"Insta smh. I liked Instagram up until a few days ago. Every time I open the app nothing loads including my feed, stories, and profiles. All it keeps giving me is unable to load or cant refresh feed and its annoying. Ive tried updating my phone, the app, and even completely reinstalling it and nothing has changed. I have full internet and data so I dont know what the problem is..feel free to enlighten me"
"Very disappointed. I had an Instagram account for 8 years, that has so many pictures, memories and messages that I can not retrieve. My account has been hacked and deleted, after many attempts of contacting the support team. I have had no correspondence, and no help Quite possibly the worst experience Ive had with a social media app. I still cannot access my account which has been compromised by another person, therefore am reluctant to start a new account"
"WONT LET ME SEND SUPPORT REQUEST FOR HACKED ACCOUNT. So as the title suggests my Instagram has been hacked. Whoever hacked it changed my username, email address, and telephone number associated with the account of course. All the links sent to my email just bring me to a page that says error occurred. Ive tried sending a support request numerous times. But when it brings me to that page I first type in my email address but after doing so the keyboard wont go away no matter what I do. So I am unable to check off the remaining boxes, scroll down, and hit send report. The person who has hacked my account is causing serious chaos; threatening people and anything else you can imagine. I am honestly shocked its this difficult to reach out and fix the problem I feel completely helpless knowing that someone has all my personal information and contacts and I have no idea who it is and why theyre doing what theyre doing. Like Ive stated previously it sounds like a bug with the iPhones Im using an iPhone 11 Pro. Ive tried everything restarting my phone, removing and re-downloading the app, making sure its updated. But for whatever reason once I type in anything on the send support request page like I need to (as in my email) it wont let me hit send report its baffling Ive tried everything googled it nothing. Instagram has a number you can call but its basically an automated message telling you to just try to work it out through the app. I get it over 1 billion people use Instagram but wouldnt you be creating more jobs worldwide by having centers worldwide to deal with issues like this ? Any info please help"
"Delete. The new update is the worst update by far. Also, Instagram should stop committing privacy violations against its users"
"Instagram hates businesss. Recently started a business account (Ive had a personal account for years). Ive had nothing but problems with the business account, I currently cant interact with others for the safety of community blah blah blah, cant run an add, or resume/delete a previous ad that didnt actually run. Youd think Instagram would be content with bombarding everybodys account with unsolicited advertising and raiding all our data, but no, they just want to enslave and dictate to customers. It really is a disgraceful necessary evil"
Thentheresalice. Consistently tells you theres no Internet connection when I obviously am connected to Wi-Fi and data. App is really gone to hell since Facebook got it
Privacy thiefs. Just so i piss off Zuckerberg
"God forbid your account gets hacked. Instagram customer care is totally unresponsive and unhelpful. My wifes account was hacked and frozen 3 weeks ago. Numerous emails and only one reply, well investigate thats it. Its frustrating and very unfriendly toward honest users"
"Algorithms. I have been a member of a Instagram for about 5yrs now. I went from a personal page to a business page. I have over 30k followers and is active. For the past 2 months, not even 500 of my followers are able to view my content because of the algorithm. THIS IS HORRIBLE I upload great, time consuming content just to get 30 likes from thousands of likes?????? I have reported this problem to Instagram and hopefully someone would fix this"
"Ig Stories now go automatically live on FB. What a disastrous feature When was it rolled out and why? It happened today for the first time and its now too late to undo, and all my FB contacts saw something that was supposed to be for IG only. I consider this a breach of my privacy, you have broadcasted a message that was intended for a few to many"
"Bring back a photo only app. Instagram was great when it was a just a photo app, now lots of junk and to many adds. Besides that my account was hacked and lots of pictures where stolen and there is no way to get any help"
"spam alert love instafam. Feature request: igtv watch history please. And continue watching from where you left like in youtube would be awesome It would also be awesome if we were able to see; how many people actually stayed to watch the whole length of our videos, rather than just skip through them, either in stories or posts, both would be nice too, thanks again :)Update: spam viewers with sexual content in the stories, i keep in blocking them, but they keep on popping time and again"
"Even though its a great app, the privacy and security is terrible. You cannot prevent anonymous messages and from random accounts. You can have them in a filtered folder but it still notifies you constantly so it makes no difference because you still receive them. The new block feature is faulty and doesnt work. It does not block future accounts because I still get anonymous messages. Just a bunch of errors and faulty features. Its a great app if you dont have to worry about those things but it NEEDS a feature to not notify you or accept messages from any anonymous or regular accounts your are not following. There are minors that use Instagram and a message filter isnt really much help if they are still notified and receive messages from strangers. Even if Instagram is meant for adults and not minors, there shouldnt be a reason that you guys dont have a feature to block messages from non followers. I, myself have been harassed for years now because its so easy to make accounts now at days but out of all of social, Instagram has the worst privacy/security settings. Please do better"
"Pretty much an AD magazine at this point. 3 new posts... ok youre all caught up, only ads from here on out...Like where are my other friends posts??? Can I see some old posts too??? Its completely ads now. Feel like social networking is dead and these services that not only profit off your data and build models on your data to market to you, but now theyve almost completely eliminated the social networking part to hammer you with ads and profit pages. Instagram has become the flyers that get thrown on your door step that end up getting thrown out... time to throw this out"
"The Best & Most entertaining app. I enjoy Instagram and its features every single day, I dont even watch TV no more. As long as I have my phone and data and Instagram, live get better. Instagram also is a platform to show yourself, your concept, your talent or your business to the whole world. This is amazing"
Annoying. There will be a pop up saying that Instagram limits how much you can do stuff on the app and after a while the screen will go completely black and the notification will keep coming up and I cant get it to stop so I have to uninstall the app and then re download it
"Wont load activity. I have never had a problem with Instagram till yesterday. I have logged out and logged back in, I have Undownloaded and re-downloaded the app, and Ive dont a force restart on my phone for some reason everything else will load on my Instagram but when I go on my activity feed where it shows the likes and who follows you it keeps saying can not load activity repeatedly. Ive used wifi and just my regular data too and nothing"
Worst app on earth. Zuck works for CCP and Instagram will track your data
"Instagram Deleted Content after Disabling. My handle is @istyleismileHi can I please get support for my issue? Ive sent multiple messages since thanksgiving 2019 about Instagram deleting my photos while my account was deactivated. Please helpIve never had photos or videos removed for violating any terms and my account has been hacked. In August 2019 I deactivated my account to take a break. I read the terms which stated that I could reactivate my account at any time and my content would be preserved. However in November 2019 when I came back I noticed that all of my pictures have been deleted. Please, Ive had multiple accounts with you representing my business and personal interests over the years and have never had this problem. my grandmother who has since passed on and a host of other memories that have now been lost with these changes. If anything can be done I would appreciate if you could restore my account. Ive read that this is happened to other accounts who have deactivated temporarily, and once they contacted Instagram the issue was resolved. However ironically each support request that Ive sent through my account have gone unanswered. If someone could kindly please get back to me I would greatly appreciate it thank you"
Gone downhill. Ever since the algorithms started showing what I might like instead of the latest post of people I follow Instagram has been less appealing. I used to get way more likes with less followers but now that they use all your cookies and keep collecting data I feel like Im a product instead of it being an app to share my memories and travels with my network
I love Instagram. I love Instagram its so fun to use I have a personal account and one for my dog And it so easy to use The only thing I would like to see is that Instagram shows you  who doesnt follow you and lets you unfollow them all in one click of a button instead of having to download an app to to do it why not include it on your own app other than that Instagram is great
"Horrible updates. This last update is the final straw, why would I ever want to see suggested posts. I follow what I follow because I want to see it, unbelievable how they think I want to see things based on the data they steal from me. Bad enough they removed chronological order. This app is going downhill so fast. As soon as something new pops up Im hopping ship. Instagram doesnt deserve the users it has"
My account got hacked and Instagram isnt doing anything. Ive been trying to report the account so it could be deleted cause Im done with the account being hacked
November 2020 update - WHACK. This update is disrespectful. The introduction on the terms and agreement email states the goal of Instagram is to connect people to each other first and then to products. It seems the main goal is to sell us things we dont need and this is proven by moving the notifications and post button to the top where it is secondary. Straight up DISRESPECTThis is speaking on user experience. Replacing the notifications button with a shop button is not a mistake. I see you Facebook
"This new update prioritizes shopping and puts art on the back burner. Instagram is not a shopping app, stop trying to force your Facebook influences into this app that used to be so beautifully designed around artists. Sad to see the app succumb to capitalism and ad revenues as its priority instead of giving artists the platform to reach their desired audience. Time to move on from Instagram"
Change it back. This new update is terrible. Nobody wants to buy things straight from Instagram. Its becoming less and less enjoyable. The fact that the STORE takes priority over your own accounts information like new likes and such just proves how little Facebook cares about the user experience. SWITCH IT BACK
"Impossible to get help. The allow sharing to stories option in the privacy setting of stories has been missing from my account, so people cannot repost my stories when I tag them. I have tried to get help and contact instagram and no one has responded"
"Suggested posts never ending /:. Please take away the suggested feed that allows you to scroll for days on people o don&#39;t follow At the very least make an option to use that feature. I get you want to make money and have us on your app all day but I only follow people I want to. This is why I keep Instagram over Facebook. I love seeing photos of my friends n family vs data heavy Facebook. Instagram unfortunately tries to always be other apps and doesn&#39;t realize we came to this platform for the beauty and simplicity. STOP copying apps like tiktok, Facebook, Snapchat"
Add yours. on my spam account i am able to access and use the add yours feature on instagram stories but on my main account that i am on most often it wont allow me to use the feature. PLEASE FIX THIS
"New update ruins functionality. I have both personal and business accounts on both Facebook and Instagram and for years, Ive easily shared my Instagram posts to their respective Facebook accounts - personal to personal, business to business. With this new update, it seems Im only allowed the ability to share to one Facebook account so I have to choose which one I would like to have that functionality?? Not to mention that simply posting has been made more complicated. Why on earth did that icon need to be moved, and why on earth would it be moved there?? And Im really hoping theres a stop switching to dark mode when creating a post setting because I really dont like dark mode. At all. Sometimes I wonder if developers have ever heard of the K.I.S.S. method"
Disabling accounts for no reason. I filled the form to verify my identity and emailed a picture of me with my ID. The response I got was We cant give you access to this account or continue with your request this has happened to THREE OF MY ACCOUNTS. Might as well save yourself the disappointment of building a account from September 12 2015- February 2021 just to have your intellectual property STOLEN BY FACEBOOK
"Poor customer service/ help. Ive been experiencing technical issues with instagram that prevent me from adjusting my privacy settings. This has let to unwanted posts from strangers as my account is locked in public. Ive done everything from redownloading the app, deactivating the account, and reported the problem many times. No response"
The best app ever. I love the privacy on Instagram Me encanta todas las cosas que tiene es perfecta
"Love the app BUT. I spend so much time on instagram, because I like it, but, the updates are staggered. Since about September of 2021, people have been doing the add yours on their stories. I have 3 accounts, and Im able to do that on all BUT my personal account. 7 months have gone by and Ive never been able to do that sharing photos trend :/"
"Notifications Less Accessible, Hate It. I hate the new update. I have NEVER purchased anything from Instagram and have no interest in online shopping on an app I use for social connection and interaction. I hate, hate, HATE that my notifications walk has been replaced with product recommendations. The notifications wall can only be accessed on the top right corner of the home page. Why? I am more interested in seeing which friends and family members have seen my posts, or if theyve commented on it. Instagram feels a lot less like a social networking app now that product recommendations seem to be more important than accessing notifications? I dont care about buying peoples products, PLEASE stop pushing the shopping aspect down our throats.Also, PUT THE POST BUTTON BACK IN THE BOTTOM MIDDLE. You are making everything so much more inaccessible and complicated to use Its so obvious that Instagram is trying to be TikTok, Facebook, AND Snapchat. Its tiring"
"Please, Instagram - fix your algorithm and update. All we want is for our main feed to show us who we follow, and none of this show your post to 10% of your followers garbage. ESPECIALLY for artists and small businesses who NEED this platform to grow their livelihoods, the new update is critically hurting small accounts who need what was once the best thing about this app - the ability to get your content in front of new people. Now, if your post doesnt do as well with the initial 10%, Instagram wont show it to your other followers, PLUS decrease your reach for future posts? And this is all so Instagram and facebook can make more money through their ads (which dont work that well, from experience). Instagram used to be an amazing app that let me discover so many amazing artists and businesses - now its a struggle, frustrating, and incredibly discouraging to see my growth slowly come to a halt, when it used to be steadily increasing. Please, Instagram and Facebook, I speak for literally ALL of the incredible artists on your app: FIX YOUR ALGORITHM because its slowly killing us. Instagram used to stand for creativity and discovery - it now stands for capitalism and discouragement of the hard working"
Losing faith in Instagram. My friends account got hacked and several people blocked and reported the account. The hacked account is steal up and its been two weeks
"Rip freedom of speech. App used to be cool ButWhen your page can be deleted based upon people reporting you based upon their being mad at you of your opinion or their own personal issues Or the fact The app tells u what is funny or not Shows The app is not about freedom of speech or communities just making people popular for the moment for monetary gain Every page look at now has 100,000 rots commenting under the pictures They can report your images from years ago but they cant stop all the robots or porn Yes rip ig"

Share to Story. Why can I not share to my story its not privacy please release this feature
122222111111. I have data n wifi n all my other apps seem to work fine but Instagram keeps telling me no internet connection
Storage. This app doesnt need to store anything Yet it stores 2 gb of data in 2 weeks I am very curious as to why and what does this app keep stored
Delete this app. You literally spy on people yup everyone when you give them access of your camera they spy on you take pictures through your camera
"Hard to Get Help. I cant access the Instagram account through the app. The app went down for two days. I tried restarting my phone twice, logging out which it then would not let me back in, then I tried to deleted and download the app twice. I tried the forgot password since it was not taking the password I know worked. No reset email and not in spam. Then I  tried to access through my Facebook account and will nothing. It looks s hard to get to anyone even through the help section"
"USELESS, DISAPPOINTING. I am using Instagram since more than 6 years with a same account and suddenly they disabled my account yesterday for no reason and today i got another message saying its deleted for violating the terms. Like what how? I have got pictures of my late family in there its my book of memories and joy and they just deleted it like that without even a cause or warning, at least I could have downloaded my data and deleted the trash App my self. You cant just make me compromise with my data Its totally unfair"
"RE: newest update to personal feed. Its hard enough to see the posts of the people I actually follow on my personal feed with the way the algorithm works prior to the update. The way things are now with the new update, I feel like Im seeing only 20% of the content I actually follow and subscribe to because I keep getting fed accounts I never followed in the first place. Promoting these accounts is what the explore page is for. Dont make it harder to see the content we choose to follow. Please revert back to the way people enjoyed their content displayed. Youre making it harder for people to enjoy being on this app"
Dumb. I cant download the app bc they keep asking me for all my information like bye
"Ive been needing help with the same issue for over 4 years now. Ive been on Instagram since it started but over the years since I made my account public and a  business page Im not to change my profile picture , change my bio, or even make my acc private again. I sent in multiple request for help and Im still not hearing back from anyone.. at this point should I just delete the account lol if that even works"
STOP INVADING OUR PRIVACY. yall acting like some people dont read terms and conditions like we know yall spying on us dont lie and stop suspending people for having a famous person in their pfp when CLEARLY they are a spam page and they arent impersonating
Account Missing. Pretty disappointing that a company as big as Instagram doesnt have one person to assist people whose account have gone away for no reason. Something that can assure people that their account is there just for personal photos to share... would if someone from support could help me out
InstaTRASH. I Deleted the app from all of my devices after they changed their policy allowing them to view and record you just because the app is installed. I dont even see posts from people I follow. Terrible app is useless unless you are a spy
Delete. Invasion of privacy
"Unable to Use the App or Request Support. Was logged out of my account this morning due to unusual activity. (For the fiftieth time in the past several months) Now I have to submit a live video to confirm Im a human and to confirm my identity. Not only is this a gross invasion of privacy, and a source of concern, the face recognition software repeatedly crashes as soon as the app is launched. I dont even have a way to report the issue. In my personal experience, particularly in the past two years, Instagram has been going down the drain at a very rapid pace from a user standpoint. Wish Facebook didnt feel obligated to ruin Instagram for us all. Way to go to your Dev and QA and Security teams Wish someone came up with an alternative out there"
"Beautiful Photo Sharing App. A beautiful, clean photo sharing app with the attention of millions at any given time. There are some nebulous practices to capitalize on users attention many wish were more transparent. More precise data provided, especially when it comes to advertising with a business account would be preferred.As well, new business account users will almost certainly find the imbalance in ability to easily gain new followers compared to their rivals older accounts comparable to swimming up stream.Overall however, one of the best photo sharing and community discovering apps ever created"
New world order app. Selling our data and censoring our voice. It couldnt get any worse
Instagram business problems. Instagram: an app that offers a marketing platform with no technical support for businesses that invested a ton of time and money to create amazing profiles and setup shopping.. only to have my product tagging taken away and stale content left behind because I travelled to a location that doesnt offer shopping. I was stuck in a non-communication loop of why it was taken away.. tried resetting my account back and forth from creator to business to personal to business and round and round in circles with no answers. &amp; when I message for customer support...crickets.... no wonder your share prices are dropping. Huge companies are taking notice of your bad service and dropping you for marketing also.. its a trend
"Lack of support when things go wrong. I had a small business page that was hacked and impossible to get back into. I read the Instagram help page tips and nothing worked so I filled out a form and got a reply saying my accounts been deleted and theres nothing they can do. Why are innocent genuine users offered no support but hackers can do what they want? Instagram has my data and I cant access it, its morally wrong"
"Instagram very difficult to navigate. As a user of maybe 100 or more apps on iPhone, I find the instagram app to be the most user UNfriendly of them all. Its not intuitive what to do, the feed is disorganized, the menu is not obvious, I could go on.  I honestly have had to ask my kids multiple times how to perform simple tasks on this app which I do not need to do for any other app. I want to see pictures from my friends and I could care less about people I dont know. Just show me people I know"
"Mark Zickerberg is the devil. When I think of Instagram I think cheap UI, poor design, and an even poorer UX. This app is designed for nothing more than capturing data and driving users to Facebook. The features are poorly implemented, and often detract from the UX. The formatting of posts is out dated, and the functionality of the app is poor. Mark zuckerburg should just kill himself"
Not honouring the privacy setting photo album. It doesnt show photos from the only album Im allowing access to it. Fix it and then I will change my rating
Couldnt refresh feed. I woke up to open Instagram and it says couldnt refresh feed i restarted my phone and clear the cache data and it is still the same. I also used my data thinking its just about wifi but no. Pls fix it
"Account Hacked & No Customer Support. My Instagrams account was hacked WHILE I WAS USING IT. They changed my password, removed my email, and phone number. All of the instructions listed in the Help Center either dont work OR dont offer all of the solutions listed. Very frustrated"
"Not what it used to be. if it werent for the fact that i have many photos saved on here, i would delete my account. the algorithm is horrible, i cannot see anything my friends post. everything is about shopping. i also stopped using this app when the notifications broke ??? its nothing on my phones end, all my notifications are on for the app. ive uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing works . this app has progressively gotten worse instead of better over the years"
"Stolen pictures. I see repeatedly people using IG celebritys pictures with different names, IG should show some control or authority.Other than that a great place torelax"
"Unfair algorithms. As a new entrepreneur who has been on instragram for quite a few years now as a personal account previously , the way the algorithms are set up, has now become more damaging than helpful . Its not a fair field for persons that arent celebrities to attract persons to their page"
"Make you give access to cam and mic even for still photo stories. Instagram appears to have gone back to forcing users to enable their cameras and microphones to post a simple story that includes only a photo from their gallery. This is a blatant disregard for privacy from the company caught in 2020 accessing camera when users werent actively using the camera. I hope this is a bug that will be fixed and not a feature. Good thing Apple makes it easy to switch on very quickly for a post, and then switch off again once the post is done. I have already quit fb, it will be a bummer to quit instagram but I hope they fix it so more users dont quit ig as well as fb"
Account access. My account is logged on two more accounts and I went to log onto my personal account and Instagram would not let me
Fake accounts. I enjoy the app posting memories and all these only problem is that people create fake accounts in order to steal information from you I suggest instagram do some research and delete fake spammers here
Privacy request. I&#39;m tired of receiving message requests from spammers and porn stars and hackers and so on. Please create an option to be able to choose who can send us messages as well as message requests. This is total crap now
"yeah. instagram has worked great for me in the past, and it works just fine on my other devices but when i got a new phone and i tried logging into my account it wouldnt let me and said there was an error it says proxy HTTP status 502 bad gateway but my wife and data is just fine, as all my other apps work"
"Bad violation rules. In this age of personal sex work (onlyfans) people tend to use their other social media to advertise for it, I believe accounts and posts shouldnt be removed for sexual activity if theyre private or on a close friends story. If its not being shown to the public eye theres no reason to delete it let women run their bodies how they want"
"Just as bad as Facebook. I cant go a day without someone trying to hack my professional account or tagging me in this b.s free I phone. This company needs to get their act together. Its going down the drain quick because everyone realizes its trash. Why arent they monitoring fake accounts and deactivating them? Its an actual job position but I guess they are being paid to sit there and laugh. This job title itself employed millions for tic tok. Get the spam under control, I may as well call you my email account and create a spam folder to put you into(instagram)"
Decent. I love the app Instagram nice for social media &amp; able to contact share &amp; more. Hides your privacy and is good &amp; safe. Recently though it put a warning saying it wont work until the 17th and its the 17th but its still not working please fix it. Im not able to do anything
Security is terrible. My instagram account has been hacked by somebody there is no way I can report the account and get it closed there is no contact number to phone somebody to get it closed. Ive had multiple of my friends report the account but yet to receive a response and the account is still active. They are messaging people trying to scam them into giving them money for bitcoin. Which is resulting in me getting a lot off abuse This is disgusting from instagram you need to up your security Or provide a way to get hacked accounts closed they have managed to change my email and phone number on the account so I cant recover my password either. They are sending messages to all my followers trying to scam them for hundreds even thousands off pounds and yet instagram has done nothing about this There are hundreds off accounts that exist on instagram that are scamming and committing fraud every single day but yet nothing seems to get done about it Instagram you need to pull your finger out and provide a more secure platform and prevent accounts from being hacked and prevent people scamming and fraud
"No support. I have three separate Instagram accounts-0ne personal and one for each of two businesses I have. Since changing phones, one account has taken over the other two, and no matter how I post photos, they all end up on one accountVery frustrating and I have no idea how to fix it"
"No reels or music. I have 2 accounts on Instagram, a public and a private personal. On my private account I have all the features including reels and music On my public account that I recently created, I have neither and it is the account I actually need the features on. Ive tried updating my phone deleting and reinstalling the app, looking for updates for the app to no avail. Its honestly ridiculous that there isnt consistency. I also know of someone with over 10,000 followers who has never been given the reel feature. Get it together Instagram"
"Why select features?. I loved IG as an app and never had any real complaints up until these last updates. Apparently only select users are allowed to share post from their feed to their stories(never had any delinquent offenses). I have 2 accounts and neither of them are the same nor do they have the same features(both are personal accounts, no business/professional accounts). I hope they make an update to get IG back to how it was"
Disabled my account & lost 9 years of pictures. Im honestly heartbroken right now because Instagram disabled my account that Ive had since I was in MIDDLE SCHOOL because Im not who I say I am. Its clearly a mistake and I can prove it but when I go to the help center it says your request cant be processed and that theyre working to fix it. Im scared Ill never get all those years of photos back. Ive also heard that people have been hacking accounts and making them pay $$ to get them back so Im hoping thats not the case. Instagram please help me
"Hacked. My daughters account has just been hacked. Someone has got access to her photography account, changed her username and password to his own and is now deleting her photos. I cannot see anywhere on the app on how to contact Instagram for support. Can anyone help please? x"
"Spies. The fact that this app can see you through the camara no matter what, they can do it whenever they want"
"Removed ability to post stories w/o mic & camera. In the last update they removed the ability to post stories without giving the app access to an always on microphone and camera. Understandably in todays world of data harvesting and user tracking, not everybody wants to have an app such as Instagram with permanent microphone access. Instead of getting me to give access to the microphone, Im now just not using Instagram"
"Feed Update is Horrible. The new update filling your personal feed with suggested posts is just awful it makes me so mad. Instead of seeing the posts of people I chose to follow its cluttered with random suggested posts, thats literally what the explore page is for. Ditto with replacing the like, follow, comment page with shopping, infuriating. Once again my personal feeds being filled with crap I dont want nor chose to see. I used to love Instagram, but they stopped prioritizing what the people actually want and care about (as all these 1 star reviews prove), with each update it gets astronomically worse, I want to delete the app all together"
"Break up Facebook ASAP. Its incredible how Facebook makes sure to destroy Instagram a little bit more with each new update. The latest one had this awful change to videos, as they keep trying to push us to watch Reels. I really do hope this company is eventually broken down and loses Instagram and WhatsApp, which used to be good apps before Zuckeberg touched them"
Terrible update. This app used to be about sharing photos and now the privacy concerns with this new update are horrendous. Watching people through the front camera ?? What is thatt?? Also bring back chronological order
Poor customer service and help. Instagram at least 3 family members of mine and my account has been hacked today. Our password and email address removed giving us no access to our accounts while also forwarding links to people close to me that trust me there by exposing our info. Yet when I reported the oaccount impersonating me I only got a response about how its not violating your guidelines. You are the worst
"Your app is alright. I enjoy using instagram but there are many frustrating things that all hang to do with your lack of empathy and understanding for your users. There is no way to reach an actual person for help and there is little to no guarentwe that your automatic email will provide any help. Ive been locked out of accounts, had people steal my info and still there was no help. Dont pretend this response was even read"
Spying again. Once again Instagram is turning on the camera when Im just browsing my feed. Im glad the new iOS snitches on them.Facebook will claim its a bug. All those developers and you cant find the bug after a year? I thought so
Racial discrimination. Blocking freedom of speech and invasion of privacy
"Use less data option turns off every update... data hog. One star. Every time I update the use less date option turns off.... ticks me off. Been using web browser for instagram lately, the app is such a data hog. Also with the use less data option you should have to hit play on the video instead of the pre-loading and playing automatically"
Why instagram be like this bad ?. I had 3 accounts disabled with out any reason its not a way to deal I sent hundreds of emails with my passport and the code with my personal picture and nobody answer all of my memories all of my work were in my account u become really the worst application with worst deal
Ive been hacked. Simone has stolen my Instagram page and Ive contacted support and they cant help me Not good enough
"zuck doesnt like privacy. so I had my account for around 4 years now, 6 permanent posts and maybe 25 stories (none of them advertising anything or being offensive). Also my account setting was private. Was mostly following products pages. All of the sudden ig blocks my account saying I have violated terms (of course they dont actually say what I did, just a blanket statement) and asks me to make a clear picture of my face with a paper which has my full name and ig username on it. No thanks, there are 0 pictures of me circulating online and Id like it to stay like that. I have verified my email and phone, i have 2fa active... I think thats more than reasonable"
Not a fan The Worst. Instagram has buried your friends recent posts under miles and miles of suggestions and forced advertising Impossible to go back on the timeline and find a friends post. Epic fail...these recent updates are THE WORST Very close to deleting this app and sick of them exploiting my data
"I hate new Instagram. Im sorry but Instagram was my respite against Facebook, which has horrible UX/UI Design. I was worried that the merger will ruin Instagrams UX and I was right. The new Instagram is anything but personal, it feels overtly commercial as the closest buttons we have are shop and reel  instead of notifications. Its ridiculous. Facebook is HORRIBLE to use and now Instagram is getting there. I wish there was a way I could just download the order versions. But seriously, Facebook needs to hire better user experience designers. You guys are so archaic and complicated. Think simplicity. What is the simplest way a user can navigate the features of your sights. What are the most common features users would look for. Try to answer these questions and please stop updating without doing excessive research on these questions first. I use Instagram all the time and now I hate it. And I hate that thats happened"
"Buggy. The app has been giving me issues. I cant save my privacy settings when I change them. My comments arent loading, and when I try to read them it says showing comments from followers only, yet its my follower comments I cant read. Things were better before being owned by meta"
"Love it. I have 2 accounts, one personal account &amp; one photography account. I use the photography account all the time to show off my photos ( Im a happy snapper).It is easy to use, easy to edit, and lets you know when you have a notification.l  can access both my account easily on my phone and my I pad.Great days"
"InstaGram Review. Its such a fun app and deserves 5 stars. 1 issue is my data runs out but thatsOk,Here you can make ibfs and talk to your friends. I like the new update~ Another problem is you cant remove people on a public account. Otherwise I love instagram and Its a great app"
"Hacked with no help. My account was hacked and I reported it with hopes of help regaining access. I got an initial email to prove that it was my account. But I never received any other information after that. The hacker has been changing my information as well as messaging people and I still have yet to hear back from Instagram after emailing three separate time. There is also no other way to contact them besides email, I think a call center for help would be more helpful"
Buns. Bring back the chronological order. Remove private spam accounts. All that. This app is the new Facebook 
"Horrible update. This update is disgusting to say the least. Guess what, if i wanted to explore, i wouldve gone to the explore page. I want to see posts from people i FOLLOW. i am reinstalling as we speak, but i wish there was a similar (but different) option than instagram. Facebook is dated and snapchat is... snapchat. Ever since facebook bought instagram it seems they have been pushing out the creators and businesses that keep their app alive. My creator friends have noticed much less engagement, and it makes sense Its pay to win now. i see maybe 5-10 posts i want from people i follow, even though i follow much more than that. I dont recommend downloading it unless you absolutely have to, the social aspect is no more. Social media has never been about connecting people, its always been about the money made from ads and our data, and this update makes that EXTREMELY apparent"
"Needs a lot of work. Its overall fine but theres a lot of minor things that are really annoying. For one, you constantly get showed sponsored posts of big accounts. Usually thinks like pimples being popped or something. And they dont go away even if you say not interested because I bet Instagram gets paid to show them. Another thing is that at least on mine my account keeps getting suspended for buying followers even though Im a personal, private account with only about 30 followers, all who are my friends and their other accounts. Its extremely frustrated and ive bend suspended about 6 times just this year"
Privacy 0. Bad app have not respect my privacy
"INSTAGRAM REELS. Id give this app 5 stars if I could get reels onto my main account. For some reason I have reels on my private personal account, but my main art account doesnt even have reels so Instagram algorithm is punishing me for not making reels. Please fix this. My business account is suffering because of it"
"logging out of accounts. I let my friends use instagram on my phone sometimes, and they log in on their account, and when they log out there is ghost or a remaining app data(I believe) from them. So itll show their username in a slot, and when i try to click on it it says,sorry we couldnt log you in. Please fix this "
"I use to give em 5 stars. But every time I comment on somebody post they block me from my page u can play music no more why u vibe so that mean yall. Watching everything Im doing witch is invasion of privacy an when people is listening to music its called free promotions yall takin that away from people Im just really starting not to like all these rules an regulations Im talkin to my lawyer now to see if Im wrong cause I dont know but I will find out ,I cant follow nobody , I dont know why I been right support about that never got results then u block me form going live cause I comment someone beautiful I wont to know how is that harassment???????? If thats the Case cause thats the only thing I can think of LET ME KNOW"

Very nice . Instagram is great for personal entertainment and for many other things If you can give Canadian users the opportunity to see post likes and the ability to use Instagram music for stories
"Evil monopoly. Overreaches to collect all your info, invades privacy, censors anything against their agenda. If you want to support big evil corporation then use this app"
"Bad. Instagram is just so dead now, and everyones getting hacked why isnt anything being done to fix this issue?"
"Privacy? . I keep getting  invitations  to like pages , people .  I found a bunch of falses profiles .... trying to impersonate some of my favorite artists, so I have to keep blocking undesirables . "
"Invasive and riddled with ads. Title says it all. Yesterday I complained to a family member about a tooth ache- today I start getting ads regarding tooth aches. This has happened over and over again, and I have heard multiple instances of others experiencing similar things, so whats the deal? Every fourth post in my feed is sponsored. That is a sickening amount of ads. They all are all tailored using your personal data which IG/Facebook harvest from your devices. How many hundreds of millions of users had their data leaked? Was it 500 million? TL;DR untrustworthy company will take your data and monetize it, barraging you with ads"
Doesnt open. This app doesnt open t crashes right away. Also upon deleting and reinstalling it would just log me back into my account? How does Instagram know to keep all that data in a cache somewhere? Shouldnt the cache be deleted when I delete the app? Help
"Can\'t turn off location tracking. No surprise since instagram is a facebook company, but you can\'t turn off llocation tracking with this app. Instagram is always tracking where you are even with every privacy selection on private. The app does not show up in Privacy - Location Services to turn off.  Facebook and Instagram are dishonest and deceptive"
"Action Blocking is ruining interactions. I follow and like a lot of pictures in a day, nothing spam worthy about it, but apparently I cant like too many pictures because I will get action blocked Isnt that the point of this app to interact with your friends and followers? This is a joke that you are limiting your users"
"Terrible algorithm. I see the same 10 peoples posts, thats it. I never see what people I follow post. No one sees my posts, the engagement is so low. I have to search people I follow just to see their posts... look on their account and can see that their posts havent been in my feed for months. Really annoying that its not balanced. I liked Instagram in the past, BUT the updated policies on privacy and nudity, etc. are really violating and controlling. Not impressed. When a new app without censorship rolls out, youll know where to find me... and the rest of us "
Privacy Issues. my ex logged into his account on my app on my phone and no matter how many times i log out of the account or i delete the app and reinstall it i am still logged in. he does not want me logged in and i do not want to be logged in. there is nothing ive found to resolve this issue. his username is still on the roll of all my accounts logged in on my phone. i want it gone. i dont want to see it. this has been an issue for almost a year now and they have not noticed the issue. i doubt i am the only person going through this and i think it is a glitch so it shows laziness on instagrams part. for all you know it could be happening to you if youve ever logged in on someone elses phone
Not too happy about Facebook ecosystem. Or google just break up the industry and stop selling info to cops and censoring Palestinians and dont allow hate speech against Russians
"How much more storage does this need?. Ok this is a good app but I hate what just happened, its Christmas so I went to go post something on Instagram so it says I need to redownload so I did and I needed to free up some space. And I kid you not I spent half an hour deleting over 400 of my photos and videos in my camera roll, deleted all large attachments in my texts and cleared all website and history data and still wont download"
Focus on the apps you have before making new stuff noone asked for. Could you guys be a little more competent with Facebook and Instagram before you do stupid vr stuff nobody asked for or wanted? Like its literally so annoying that out of nowhere on my literally full bar wifi your apps decide they just dont wanna send messages fast or at all  its a text messages its not even close to a megabyte of data going through your servers built on tooth picks and hard drives from the 90s like literally BE competent for once 
Good enough. Owned by Facebook so always on the lookout for personal liberties being taken away
Why. This app track everything u look up no matter if its lunch or a car. It will sell it and when not scrolling and trying to upload something have fun. Im on an iPhone and when I try and share my 2019 highlights it crashed every time. Only after changing my photos to basic and changing some because the photos came in large and unable to fit. If u are looking for a new social media account dont pick this one there is better out there
"was a great app until all the updates. I loved instagram but with the new update it didn&#39;t allow business accounts to have music, i switched back to a personal and it still wouldn&#39;t allow me to have music 0/10 give my my music back "
I deleted this because I got hacked. So I downloaded this app think that it would have great security but I was wrong. I was just on it one day and I looked through the pictures I liked when I notice that I have never seen these post ever in my life. So I got a little creeped out. Well I decided to go on my activity to see that it says I was logging in a 1-3 am when I was obviously not doing that so I freaked out again. It turns out I got hacked by people across the world and Instagram did nothing about it and they didnt even care so thats why I gave it a very low rating. I did this just to warn people that there are people that arent afraid to hack you so please be careful and stay safe on the internet
Spyware. Just look at the data they collect
"Great tool, no customer service. I love Instagram and have been using it for many years as personal and business page. However, if issue occurs there seems no way to reach customer service. For unknown reason, my Business account is marked as being outside of the US, while I live in the US, and I cant set up Instagram shopping, which is very frustrating. I wrote an email to Instagram and Facebook, but got no answer. If anyone knows the solution to this, please help"
"Sometimes I like it but there are so many problems. So I have several accounts. One is a fan account, one is a personal page, and one is for my business. And at first when I got Instagram the algorithm was fine, I got the average amount of likes and followers on my posts, etc. So everything was going smoothly until fairly recently. So a few months before the election I started to notice less likes on my fan account first, then after the election I have many people unfollowing me and not seeing my stuff all the time on all my accounts. So honestly, Instagram has the worst algorithm Ive seen. Also, pushing reels and constantly updating the explore page and hashtags is annoying and greedy, especially when there are bigger problems Instagram could be attending to, like, I dont know, the 500 bot accounts that message me every day. But other than that I do like some posts I see and that I can contact my family, but all in all, IG is a dumpster fire and if I did not have my family and friends on here I would just move to Reddit"
Tired of being harassed. Instagram really has to setup a setting like twitter and snapchat where people that you dont follow cant message you ive blocked over 20 fake accounts. I will stop using the app until more privacy is implemented into this app or even limit making so many new accounts
Use to be good. Now they will spy on every device you own. Bye china communist pigs
"Turning camera on without permission. I was browsing my feed and noticed the green dot near the top right. I swiped down my control center and it said Instagram had recently accessed the camera. Ill be removing camera permission and reporting this to Apple.  Not cool Instagram. For the record and everyones information, Instagram and Facebook have been caught doing this, using the camera to spy on people and target advertising based on their reactions. They previously said it was a bug that has been fixed. But I guess it came back again? Unacceptable"
Instagram is everything. I use Instagram I use the hell out of it. I have tons of incredible followers. I experience actual pure brilliant love thru Instagram. I run 2 Instagram accounts. It is an incredible tool for making life happen. Thank you for Instagram. Im about to go supernova with these accounts and save my way of life through this crazy time. Saving my business and saving my life. We can get through this together. Stay strong
"Could be better. -Let us sort the feed in chronological order from newest to oldest, I dont like your sorting technique.-3rd party apps to track unfollowers arent allowed, so why not add one within Instagram? I dont want to continue following those that unfollow me and leave me following them. Show these unfollowers-After getting follow requests &amp; going to those profiles, the approve/delete buttons dont work while viewing the profiles. It forces me to go back to the notifications feed to do it there. Please fix"
Easily Hackable w/no customer service. My account was hacked and Ive reported it as well as my friends because theyve blocked my business account and began posting false/scamming information from my page. They were able to change my phone number and email and Instagram has done nothing. The only time they act is if youre a celebrity or have a verified check. I wouldnt suggest this app. Ive had my account for over 10 years and it was so easily taken with 0 consequence or resolve
Appeal. I had the same instagram account for like 5-6 years and now all of a sudden its blank and cant see anything its saying error and now i cant log into my account i never been banned or reported since i been on this app but i have no idea why this is happening im not allowed access to my own information at this point i feel as if anti trust is one reason why this is happening
instagram. Update is trash. Why would you move the notifications tab? I have 3 business accounts and one personal and its already a lot to manage. I have bigger hands than the average female and its a struggle for to reach the top of my screen when holding my phone with one hand
Love Instagram sooooo much. Its been great to connect with others and see the world via my phone  Thankful for it in my personal and business life 
"Hellscape. I started using this app in 2012, sharing pictures of the fountain down the road and middle school graduation. Wholesome stuff. Now I use it to watch reposted TikToks and accidentally click the shopping tab and check up on people I hate. I recommend reading Jaron Lanier or thinking about how much data they are taking from you while u rot in bed looking at hot people with fake lives. Terrible very very icky app"
In terms of recovering accounts Instagram basically doesnt care. I recently lost access to my account due to the fact that I cant confirm either my phone or email because the phone I made that account with got stolen back in 2017. Instagram doesnt provide the proper help but just lets the users handle the situation by themselves
T&C terrible breech of privacy. I would offer a no star rating if there was an option. Not keen on the sketchy terms and conditions that allow old Instagram to do whatever they like. Time to save my photos and delete ol insta
"Issue. So I had deleted Instagram for a while maybe about 2/3 weeks now. And theres a message that pops up showing that if you delete it all data stored will not be deleted. Multiple times already Ive deleted and re downloaded Instagram and it saved my account and everything, now this 1 time it didnt. What is the issue here?"
Too many ads. I loved Instagram the way it used to be. Now you have to scroll through a gazillion ads before you can look at your posted pics. It was very personal to me the way it was. I dont do Facebook so this was a special feature for me to see just my family & friends pics. I may delete my Instagram because of all the ads & my pics are pushed all the way down like they arent worth posting
"Its a trap. Once you get tired of burning your brain cells on this stupid app it will not let you delete your account. So now there is a private account of me that has over 2,000 followers and my photos that I have no access to forever on the internet. Fun stuff"
"Huge on Data. Even on low data mode on my phone and using many settings the data usage on this app covers 95% of my phone data usage. You have to optimize it better, not everyone has unlimited data"
"Its great but. I love Instagram, it&#39;s one of my favorite social media platforms, but one issue is how the likes are shown. Please bring it back to just the numbers &amp; get rid of the unnecessary so &amp; so &amp; 50 others liked your photo. Also, sometimes it doesnt load for me, even on data"
Disabled account for no reason. Instagram disabled my personal Instagram for literally no reason. Said they would review it and havent. There is no way to contact the help center. It was my favorite app and I am extremely disappointed and upset about my account. Those pictures are very important to me and I dont have access to them. Please someone contact me to fix this
Too many ads popping up while watching stories. Its not something that is regulated I just seen a sponsored post where theyre selling a cake with the shape of a pnis. These sponsored posts also pop out every time you watch 3 different stories. I will stop using Instagram and change to TikTok if this continues Instagram is just TikTok content anyways 
"STOP THE UPDATES. Instagram used to be one of my favorite apps but, now I find myself rarely using it due to the unnecessarily bad updates. For one, you never get to see posts from who you actually want too. Its the same peoples posts appearing over and over. Bring back chronological order Why am I seeing posts from 12 days ago rather than ones that were posted today? I dont see myself using this app much in the future due to the new update that replaced the notification/likes tab with a shopping one instead. As if were not in the middle of a pandemic Who is truly going to Instagram to shop? Its become quite evident that they dont care about their consumers and instead only seem to care about profit/money. Make another app if you want to sell Instagram clothes, but leave Instagram to the original idea of being a picture sharing app"
Yall be spying on me. I be talking bout things or even jus googling dem in browser and allova sudden I be seeing ads for it on insta
instagram is spying on literally every user. black
Do not recommend. Do not recommend this app. I am unable to even use my IG in its entirety as my personal Instagram seems to be lacking all of its features. I have no option to repost to my story from peoples pages and I have reached out to IG Help multiple times about this issue with NO response. Trash
"LUCKY TO EVEN GET STAR. this app is so bad, my account got hacked and they somehow managed to change the email and the phone number, there also using my account to scamming my followers out of money and what not.I emailed instagram about it and havent gotten any response and also sent in a video picture as proof since my profile picture is me but they responded with cant prove your identity..this is absolutely outrageous and it shouldnt be this simple and easy for someone to access your account"
"Horrible support. There is no tangible support service for this app. If you lose your 2FA authentication guess what? There\'s not way to get back into your account, or even recovery or delete your data. It seems like a company with the valuation of Facebook should be able to staff a moderately sized support team to help with its customers"
I wish i could rate this 0 stars. This app is full of glitches that disregard your privacy. It will randomly send images from your camera roll to your contacts. It also collects so much data. In addition it chooses to allow horrible disgusting content to stay posted; even when it is brought to their attention via report the deny the issue. 0/5
CRAP. Absolutely crap. Cant believe this. Random person I dont know got my phone number from insta when I asked. Aint gonna go in detail cause I cant be bothered. How can you allow this to happen. Do not get they dont protect your privacy. Dont be fooled by this shmucks
"Devs are useless and biased. Devs refuse to delete blatant spam accounts, borderline child pornography, pornography in general, information that doesnt align with their narratives, etc. App is often down or buggy. They tried implementing fact checkers which only increased our distrust in this stupid app. No surprise its connected to Facebook"
Since the Facebook wasapp insta meltdown. 5th October 2021 The app crashed and lost a video which can never be relived. Use your main camera first over ever trusting this app to save your data. Gutted
"Awful update user since 2012. This has got to be the worst update ever. For me its the last straw i will not be using the app anymore until it is fixed. I get an ad after every 4 posts. Yes, 1/5 pictures is now an ADVERTISEMENT. Also i was very upset when they took away chronological order but that just seems like a minor thing compared to what instagram has become. Now, posting pictures is not the main feature, Neither are your likes or friends. It has been replaced by shopping and reels I refuse to use this app any longer"
"I need help. I have been trying to contact Instagram for over a week with no responses and no way of speaking to an actual person. The fact sheets are not helping. I have been kicked off my Instagram saying my password has been compromised, it will not allow me to change my password and when I can get into my image it keeps glitching saying it cannot be loaded, or that there has been an error. It looks as though my page is brand new saying I have completed 2/4 steps of the set up procedure. However it wont allow me to do anything if I try. When I look at my profile from another persons account everything is there and nothing has been altered which makes me think I have been hacked. Please Instagram, help me get my page back. I cannot lose over 15 years worth of memories and photographs. HELP"
"Bye. After so many years with Facebook and Instagram I made the decision to delete both Facebook accounts and both Instagram accounts, due to the abuse of power and blatant invasion of privacy"
Blocked list. Every time looking at that or settings it backs me out of Instagram. I cant look to see whos on my blocked list or under privacy settings. Its kicks me out
"Black Screen. Ok so i have had Instagram for quite a while. I have loved the app up until recently. Since the update, i cant access my own personal Instagram page even if i wanted to. If i got the button on my phone, the screen goes completely black and i have to exit the app in order to get back to the screen where my friends posts are. I have tried uninstall and reinstall. Ive tried turning my phone off and on, nothing has worked. I tried googling and all it says is to wait for the next update. Not to mention, if i do manage to access my page, i cant go to my setting or see any of my saved videos or anything like that. I have to go on the Internet on my phone to access my page. What gives??"
"Poor. I have been using Instagram since it was born. Im tired of the ads and forced content suggestions on my feed I spend more time having to press hide ad and not interested than actually enjoying my own feed and the accounts I INTENTIONALLY follow Get rid of the ads and suggestions It is a violation of my preference, violation of my freedom of choice, violation of my privacy and plain out disrespectful"
"Been user for 9 years, but growing tired. Used to be a site for photos but if your not trying to sell a product, pushing a political movement or not posting a shirtless selfie, your posts dont get priority"
just deleted. The new Meta app update has changed key functionality and removed or moved the ability to switch accounts. Breaking the user interface is just the last straw on top of all the annoying algorithms.  Meta is snooping on all messages and harvesting data from WhatsApp and FB and serving dynamic advertising based on the content of messages
"Enjoying Instagram. I get blocked all the time for absolute nothing . Its been very difficult to use this app. I am a medical doctor specializing in oncology and a publisher in Radiation Oncology . I last posted on my personal page in December 2021 not because I chose to but no matter what I try I get messages that I gave someone my pin and I did not , my account is in jeopardy and I live in constant worry . Its not good for my mental health as a survivor of DV I need to support other survivors . I am going you can help me get to my accounts"
Profile picture error. Instagram wont let me change my profile picture to agustd2. It keeps saying something is wrong with my internet but I have the WiFi full bars and cell phone data. I feel like I tried everything and it still dont work. PLEASE HELP INSTAGRAM
"Meh. 2020 update:This new version is AWFUL NO ONES SHOPPING ON IG THAT YOU HAVE TO ADD THAT FEATURE ON THE BOTTOM The new organization makes NO sense. So bad. -RECENT UPDATE:I managed 3 Instagram accounts from my phone, not including my own. The ones I manage have the WONDERFUL highlight feature. My personal account used to have it, too. I can still see my highlight reel, but havent been able to add to it in a month. YES, Ive deleted &amp; reinstalled, Ive logged out and logged in. Deleted the highlight and tried to make a new one, and nothing. But, works on the other 3 with no problems  HALP-4yrs ago: love Instagram but am not happy with the new update. My account is very private and I like it that way, however, I do not like that I am not able to see anything on other private accounts. How am I supposed to tell if I know the person, because for whatever reason, you can&#39;t click and see their profile picture, and now, you can&#39;t even see the amount of photos/followers. It&#39;s just ridiculous"
Censorship & Privacy. Censorship is high - shadow banning - and the privacy terms are unacceptable
"Music only works on 1 account. Although I will say Instagram at its basic functions works most of the time, once you start using it for multiple reasons youll start to find the problems you cant fox searching on Google, and everyone knows that its impossible you have a way to get a hold of Instagram or Facebook. I have a personal account and a business account. IG music for stories, only works on my personal account. On my business account, I can only use the music under recommended  search will always be completely blank. Ive sent requests, however still waiting so I can use this function for my business"
FB account center limiting one IG account SUCKS. Seriously?  I cant have one Instagram account go to my personal account and another go to my creative page?  This is a serious reason to use other apps.  A big downgrade IMO
"App is becoming worse every year. Instagram use to be a fun restricted free app but over the years, it started to become less and less like its own app, the restrictions on the app have gotten worse, if you post a certain comment, post or story, Instagram will take it down and threaten to delete your account which I honestly find unnecessary especially when they been letting bots free roam the app for quite a while and it has grown worse, the worst part is theyre trying so hard to copy TikTok with the unnecessary reels where the post notifications use to be, its like Instagram is forgetting that they use to be their own app where you post pictures and not reels in the middle of the app button. And the shopping tabs that replaced the notifications button on the bottom is unnecessary, it would be more tolerable if the reels & shoppinh tabs were next to the DM tab instead of moving the post & notifications buttons there. This app is digging itself in a hole and is not that enjoyable anymore, got wayyy too restrictive, that and the bots are a big problem for this app"
"Instagram problems. Instagram will not let me get back in my old account. I have the information and its all correct, but its being very complicated"
"Customer Help needs to improve. Instagram claims they care for their customers but they really dont. They dont have actual people to help with any issue, no phone number not email NOTHING. Their privacy police and harassment policy TRASH. Ive been trying to take down two fake Instagram accounts for almost s week because they fall under impersonation of another person and bullying and harassment yet here I am. The page are still up. At this moment we are focusing on content with the most harm Im sorry I read that as if you arent important theres no help.Been using Instagram for years now, had to delete my original account because it was too much, and im very close to deleting the second account O created and just delete the whole app itself because using this platform is harmful and with no one to help, not the police or the people in charge of this app"
Needs to add a way to check comments made on other posts. Instagram lets you look at posts that you have saved and liked through a very simple feature in the settings but if you want to view and manage comments you have to go through a complicated data download on a desktop computer. This feature could work just like the liked and saved posts do but in this case will let you manage your comments. This would make it a much less stressful and tedious task to view comments and would be a great addition to the platform
"Worst App. If your account with all of your personal data gets hacked, Instagrams service will be of no help. My account has been hacked for 4 weeks now and Ive only heard twice from Instagram despite doing everything I can to get my account back. Do not download this app There is no privacy or security"
"Sneaky, Ad-focused, & Buggy. Ive been using instagram since around 2013, and it has never been more catered to ads then it is now. There is no regard for privacy and insuring that the app is not tracking your location or your safari searches is close to impossible - Ive even been redirected to change my facebook settings in an attempt to salvage some sense of privacy in this app (note: i shouldnt need to connect to a different social media platform to change basic settings).Instagram would benefit from further transparency in both setting navigation and where your data is going. I want to be able to turn off them getting access to my searches outside of the app without having to go through countless forums giving it their best guess on how to do it"
"Oddly difficult to use. Oddly restrictive guidelines. First off, as a young adult Id say Im tech savvy, yet this app is confusing to use. Why? Please do better. Second, your guidelines say  We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities. So to criticize a PUBLIC figure, like a politician, by saying they are a coward for turning off their comments so they can ignore the criticism, and keep their page clean, should be perfectly within your guidelines. Please get better. Being able to call out politicians for their cowardliness and faults is a crucially important part of the internet.Thirdly, why are you silencing the war crimes against Palestinians? Why are you censoring people? Why are you against humanity?"
"Very invasive... with broad terms of service. Depending on what business youre in, I should assure you not to update your app. It seems with more updates it becomes more invasive to your privacy and your messages as well, even though they were built to what they are today for having features that protect privacy.. disappearing chats etc etc. in summary, horrible for business unless all you do is use this for personal use or sell promos, I recommend downloading an earlier ipa file offline if you dont want this borderline spy ware on your phone , cheers"
"New update. The new updates are really stupid and unnecessary. The app was good the way it was before and all the people wanted was a chronological feed but got tiktok jr and that recommendation to see other post on our personal feed. If I wanted to see recommended posts, I would go to the explore page. Hopefully we can get the old instagram with a chronological feed&lt;3"
Wack customer service. If you get hacked dont go to instagram for help they just give you un useful suggestions and trying to find contact info for help is hard to find and when u do find it they dont ever answer so just stick to Facebook or twitter
"Remove previous profile from about Me. Previous page names of something private, I find it ridiculous and intrusive to share that information"
Instagram is DOWN. Something really strange is happening with my iPhone and Instagram and I need REAL help. So Instagram works when Im using Wi-Fi but wont work on mobile data and my data is working and Instagram has mobile data enabled. The weird thing is nothing Instagram related seems to work on my mobile data like the web Instagram etc. This goes away when I switch to Wi-Fi and Instagram works again. Ive tried LITERALLY every single tip on how to fix this that Ive found on YouTube/the internet and nothing works. This all started roughly 2 days ago. Please tell me Im not the only one going through this mobile data/Instagram issue
IG support bots are useless. Its really frustrating when you cannot get hold of a live person from Instagram. I am not able to receive sms codes. I called phone service provider and Apple to see why Im not receiving codes. Ive done nothing wrong to get my IP/phone number blacklisted from IG and know Ive lost my account bcuz someone hacked into my account
"Annoying. I had never had issues with instagram, but at this point its annoying. Im still able to access my instagram but Im not able to access my profile and if I do my screen will go completely black and I need to exit and clear the app. To access my profile I have to go through my activities and select a picture. I can edit my name and bio but can go to my settings. Ive had to uninstall the a app to see if it fixes the issue but it still remains"
Add yours feature. Just wondering when Instagram is going to fix the add yours feature. I have reached out to support numerous times and have not even received a we have received your request notification. I cannot access it on my creator account but I can in my personal one and I know others are experiencing the same issues
"Really good app. Ive had Instagram for a while, but Ive made my own personal account. The only problem is that it wont let me change my profile from the default... Im not sure if anybody else has that problem, but otherwise its a good app I dont use it much, but I would still recommend c:"
"Algorithms. Great for personal, algorithms are destroying the entrepreneurs and creators though. Post a meme on my business account, it spreads. Post anything even remotely related to my business I dont even see the post on my own personal feed. Also, for some reason I dont have access to reels on my business page, but I do on my personal page, a page for my dog, and a page for my other business. But for some reason I dont on the page that needs reels the most for promo, my creator page . Have been sending messages for a month and no response. Bogus"
"Sells your information. If youre an artist or creator, dont use this app. They sell your ideas to major labels. Period"
Personal post. You guys need to put in a feature where you could 1 delete a photo out of a post. This is so people dont have to get rid of their entire post
"No help security is a joke. My account got hacked because someone was pretending to be someone else. Then they was told if I pay the hacker I would get my account back. Never paid the scum bag, but when it try to get Instagram to help I a robot middle finger. I fallowed the process with no help I scanned my face to try and prove it was me since I have photos of me with long hair to short hair, and from beard to no beard just to be told the have reviewed my photos and couldnt verify that Im the real person. I even sent them screen shots of the chat from the hacker, but still nothing has happen. The dude was able to change my information with out Instagram sending something out like Hey is this you?. Instagram made it easy for someone who I gave no information about me to hack my account then do nothing about it"
Garbage. Garbage. They steal your privacy. They sell your data. Any pic you post they claim it as theirs. They refuse to delete and ban fake impersonating accounts even when jump through their stupid hoops. Not a single redeeming quality to this dumpster fire and this company and its owners should be destroyed
"Unfair. I am leaving a bad review because Instagram should have allll their users on the same page. And what I mean by that is that some accounts have access to things that others dont. I have 4 accounts with Instagram. 2 personal and 2 business. On my personal page I have access to everythingggg, but on one of my business accounts I do not have access to reels (which would be really helpful to my business) and on my other business account I have access to reels but not to music. It is highly upsetting that they do this. I have written endless emails and have never received a reply. I have also googled and followed all steps and nothing has worked for me. "
Insta. Kepping info private
Hacked. Been trying to get my Instagram back from being hacked. Sent the info you asked for. How long does it take to get it restored.  Shouldn&#39;t be this hard
Awesome Tool for exposure. Instagram is very useful for many business and artists as a tool.  An unbelievable tool. It helps me express my vision in another dimension.  Free all over the world INSTANTLY.  Its an Infinite Time Machine of data sharing.  Perfect for music start-Ups like myself.Peace &amp; Blessings. Play hard Be SAFEWayne_Willy
"Account hacked, a plea for help. Hello, my account was hacked last week by a scammer and now they are posting illegally on my behalf. I have asked dozens of friends to report the page so that it will get taken down, but so far its still there and they are posting videos and stories of me that I did not authorize. This goes against Instagram community guidelines which according to IG privacy terms, the page should get taken down if they are violated. Please help me. This is happening to dozens of other people and I want to bring light to the issue and get justice. Thank you"
"Great platform bad service. Been using Instagram for a while. The app has many bugs and problems that arent being addressed. An incredible amount of bots, tons of of accounts getting hacked, tons of problems. They wont address or fix any of the problems, which is stupid for such a huge company like Facebook"
"Hacked account. I was very disappointed when the Instagram customer service didnt help me at all after my Instagram account was hacked by somebody is Russia and I lost access to my own account while my name, the photo of me and all my photos were taken over.  My friend had the same problem and was very unhappy with the Instagram service or lack of service"
"With every update, it gets worse. The title says it all, with every update Instagram rolls out the app becomes worse and worse, at this point its so similar to Facebook whats the point in being two different apps.Facebook buying the original creators out was the worst thing to happen to the app, things were better years ago.I have multiple accounts (personal and business) and the app functions between the accounts are completely different  One account is updated to the newest version, and other accounts are still running software that Instagram doesnt even support anymore (IE: Visible Likes, seeing the likes and interactions of people I follow, etc)ALSO  BRING BACK CHRONOLOGICAL POSTING  STOP CHOOSING WHO I SEE FIRST  I DONT SEE MY FRIENDS"
I swear I love Instagram. However the support is horrible and useless they dont do anything to help at all they wont let me back into my personal account that people talk to me through and Im very disappointed 
"Hate the new update. The new update is horrible. Who thought of this?? Whos idea was this?? Yall take the most important part of the app and put it somewhere I could barely even find. Instagram is the least genuine app on the internet and somehow you guys managed to make it even WORSE. You took the whole point of the app, put it in a hard to find place, and replaced it with what?? CAPITALISM?? So fake. So money hungry. Yall should be ashamed of yourselves, you showed your true colors and we all saw. What was the whole point of this app again? To share personal photos with friends and family or for celebrities to stay in touch with fans or whatever? Or to just sell us stuff we dont need to us in the middle of a GLOBAL pandemic w/ so many people unemployed and struggling. Nice"
disabled my account. i have no idea why they disabled my account but they did. and they want me to hold up a picture like you would when you just got arrested. um no. i love instagram but why disable my account? i posted my own pictures (of my cooking/baking products) and im over 13. What was wrong with this is also that someone hacked my account twice and has been doing the same thing for thousands of other people. and they are still on instagram. yall are too much. gimme back my account
Wouldnt recommend anymore. I personally used to love instagram until I started having a ton of trouble with it. My account was hacked so I made a new one and that one was hacked too. And they still havent deleted the account. I just wish they would have let me know before they deleted my first account because I had pictures on there that I would have liked to have and I wish I could have kept my followers and who I was following(I had had my account for 4-5 years and tbh I had photos on there that I didnt have on my new phone which now I know was a bad idea). Like I said I really loved instagram but they have been no help to me and to be honest I hate it now because no one has tried to help me retrieve my accounts and I have reported the problems several times. I reported them via email and within the account so I wouldnt even recommend it anymore until the get the problems fixed because its ridiculous that I was hacked 4 times before being locked out and deleted. Then I got a new account and before I even got a week in that one was hacked too and I reported that. I guess Im just disappointed
"Account Hacked, No support. My account was hacked and deleted and Instagram isnt helping me get it back"
"Unprohibited Camera Usage. I love Instagram Ive been using it for a long time now and its always my preferred social media platform but let me tell you the iPhone 11 has a feature where a green light will light up as a visual queue that the camera is turned on. So can someone tell me why that green light keeps turning on as Im browsing my feed? And as soon as my eyes dart over to that green light every time, it will turn off right away. As a person who puts value in privacy, this really pisses me off"
"Worst update ever. Sharing to stories has become extremely difficult and it now auto shares to Facebook after choosing to share to Facebook once. I also hate that if you have a business page, you cant share posts to your personal page and personal Facebook page, it only lets you share to your business page"
"Sharing stories. I have two Instagram accounts - one personal and one business. And no matter what settings I adjust, how many times I update the app, or uninstall/reinstall, my business account WILL NOT show the option to share stories. Other people/accounts can share my stories from my business account. But my personal account can not share my business accounts stories to my personal feed Ive tried everything and nothing fixes this"
Stupid. Someone hacked my account and followed 2 thousand people. I started unfollowing those stupid accounts and I got blocked for unfollowing people because it was against their guidelines. Get your priorities straight Instagram
Professional Account Different Features. Im a well known trainer in New Orleans I post a whole bunch of football videos. I have two accounts my coaches account(professional) and a personal account. Ive noticed a few months ago I cant add music to my professional account. I search all the top artist and it gives me a whole bunch of random no name artists. Its aggravating Im trying to build my business and promote my training but I cant add music to my stories for it. But my personal account has all the top artist I literally have to post on my personal account add the song I want and make sure I tag my professional account so I can have music on my workout videos on my stories. Ive BEEN tried to report this and nothing seems to happen Ive tried multiple things to see if it would work even deleting the other account but nothing. Think Instagram tries to solve this problem so people can do business on here NOPE LITERALLY NOTHING months later Im still trying to figure out why I cant add music to my stories
Hurting my business page. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS - I cant share any posts from my business page to my personal account via stories My website and page is finally ready and I would like to share this good news with my friends and family but I cant SORT THIS OUT ASAP.Instagram has DISABLED SHARING ANY POSTS AS STORY INFACT
"Customer service. Horrible customer service. Im sorry, but its totally unacceptable. My girlfriends account has been hacked and she and I have gone through every channel Instagram provides to delete this account and nothing ever happens. Ive called them directly and its basically an automated message telling you to buzz off. For a company like this with this much money it is totally unacceptable. We have personal images and info stolen by god knows who. Terrible customer service. Atrocious for a company who has so much money they cant be a dime into treating their customers right"
"They hacked my Instagram account, I dont like the new update. Ive tried to contact the Instagram support and gave them any evidence they asked of me but they couldnt help me get my Instagram back. Someone hacked my account and changed the login info and password. And they are using my pictures to lie to people.. Please I need your help. Ive had the account for 5 years please I need it back.Plus I dont like the new update, I like keeping my fyp clear with the people that I follow instead of recommending pages that I didnt follow being on my fyp"
"Great App HOWEVER NOT CONSISTENT. Instagram is obviously a well known app; however, its not consistent. I have two accounts: one personal and one for my non-profit. My personal account allows my followers to repost my stories; however, my non-profit account does not. Its crucial that my non-profit has this capability as Id like my followers to spread the word or allow sponsors to repost my stories. Please rectify this issue"
iPad version please. I like to use Instagram I have two accounts one personal and one for business but I am having to use it on my phone because when I downloaded the app onto my iPad it wouldnt fir to the screen looked totally ridiculous so I deleted it I think it would be great to have an iPad version so then people have options as to what device they use myself I prefer the bigger screen on the iPad so I can see it better so instagram when are you going to release a iPad version of the app
"Apple privacy violation. This app I have personalized ads turned off. Yeah thats still using my cookies,Website i have browsed, and the cache form my web browsers to still follow me around the web. And serve me personalized ads. They violate apples store privacy rules"
"The app is great, except for one thing. I have multiple accounts on Instagram, and on my personal I am unable to share other peoples photos to my story. If I go into my other accounts, there are no problems, but the share to story button on my personal account does not exist for some bizzare reason. I can share videos no problem, but not images"
". completely tired of this app its such a shame Ive had to make 7 or more pages all due to Instagram deleting my pages for no reason they never respond to anyones email even after they send u a code to get ur account back , they allow ppl who sell drugs , put there whole private part on the app but the moment u make a comment or post a story that THEY feel is not ok there ready to delete ur page. Not only that But the times Ive made new pages like rn I had to make a new one they dont even give me the music app or even let me change my background in my dms or let me change my emojis in the dm ... its really getting a drag all I do is post pictures of me post on my story and watch lives like my favorite ppls post to even keep going through this"
I hate Instagram anyway. With the new update they keep trying to force you to allow them to track your information. There is no decline option. Close the app and open it again to get around it. I will not use this app if it tracks my information. Get out of here.And fix the chronological order of Instagram. Thats ALL we ever wanted
"Peaches. Instagram refuses to remove lovelypeachesmusic100 after numerous concerns about her content and wellbeing. She hired someone to rape a tik tok person, she sells her INFANT for men to rape and shows videos of child abuse. Peaches should not be able to have a platform but Instagram encourages this behavior by overlooking all complaints about her"
Stealing peoples pages. Several times someone has stolen pages of pics from @everydayalonzo and we report It and IG does nothing. They are taking pics of my 4 month granddaughter and putting on their fake accounts to steal info from people entering contests. DO SOMETHING
"Overall its great. This app is amazing. The only problem with it is that when you switch to a personal account, when you have a professional account, and then switch again to a profesional account, you arent able to see your insights. I think your insights should stay no matter what. Overall, great app "
"Spyware. This app spies on you and your phone,If youre comfortable with that then go ahead and get it"
Hacked. No security or customer support. Dont waste your time. My account was hacked and I use different passwords on every site. Didnt even get suspicious login email notifications to warn me. I dont use 2FA because they only offer the SMS version (they want to collect data because its owned by Facebook). Awful
"Very bad app. There is no freedom or privacy on Instagram. Does not allow one to post freely when condemning the attacks on innocent children and civilians of Palestine, but ignores the virtual harassment of the opposers"
Cant see posts. Really annoying that I am missing posts and stories from good friends and they think Im purposely ignoring them because their content isnt showing up on my feed what in the world is going on I also notice that on my business account I have more variety for text on my stories than I do on my personal account and they are both updated at the same time. I spend less time on IG than any social app at this point
Connection. Whats up with the internet connection bug? You made an update saying you fixed it but all it did was fix it for wifi. Instagram still wont load on data only wifi connection. Been happening for 2 weeks now
Best app ever. I connect with my friends and get real information from the best sources
No reels on business account. My business account does not have reels option. My personal account does. Instagram algorithm is pushing reels but some businesses dont have the option. How fair is this? Instagram is not the app it used to be anymore
Help. How do I stop random people from messing me instagrams garbage help section sends you to privacy but its not even there anymore Nevermind you cant guess Ill delete it then
Help. Unable to login to my personal account and cant like anything on my business account. As someone whos Business relies on Instagram and getting as many viewers as possible to see my items this needs to be fixed. Or I will have no reason for Instagram
ads. Literally multiple ads every 2-3 post. The app tracks everything even other devices that share same IP
"Following Tab DOES NOT work. My Instagram works fine but when I go to see who am I following or looking at someones profile of who they follow, it says Couldnt load users I tried restarting the app, turn my device on and off, check to see any latest updates, my internet connection is fine, and even using data the message still pops up. I think its not my connection problem but rather Instagram itself being broken or corrupt. I really want Instagram to fix this and stop with the unnecessary updates. It gets worse and worse"
"Issue. Im having 2 issues. one with my personal account @flogrown.hick where I cant view my followers or even the people that have liked my pictures.The second issue is on my other account @goodolboyztk where I cant view a picture dated on May 12, 2019. I just want the picture deleted. Its been going on for over a month now. So please help me correct this issue"
"update. still dont know why instagram insists on having this update giving suggested posts in your following feed and hiding pictures from people you actually follow. is that not what the explore page is for? and putting the reels and shopping tab in the bottom, replacing your personal notifications was also a terrible move. we get it, you want to make more money so you replaced the two most used buttons to do so. annoying"
"idk. after the last update i cant access the profile part on instagram. i tried powering off the phone logging out and updating but it says that it just got updated a day ago, which is when this start"
Instacrap. Another app with terrible privacy issues and censorship
F U Instagram. Newest version of Instagram is the most annoying. Not only did they change the location of where you go to view likes and comments they replaced it with a market. Which I thought I could get used to but then the final straw for me was no longer does Instagram just access your camera roll now it makes you select photos that youd possibly like to use talk about over complicating things. I deleted the app. And to redownload it requires you update your card information so I just wont be back on Instagram ever again
terrible updates. The series of the latest updates ruin the experience of using instagram. create new post and notification buttons replaced with shopping (??? on a photo sharing app like wth) and reels (even though most of the reels Ive seen were from tiktok anyways) and put in the top corner which on larger phones is so user UNfriendly. Honestly  you should listen to your users
Many breaches of privacy and download issues. Doesnt let you re download unless you have money on your payment option which is dumb for a free app. Not only that but this app has many security issues as well as the removal of people pages for menial things. Good for personal contacting and over obsession into people lives
"No like updates is the worst in ig history. Its so ridiculously annoying I really dont have many words besides confirming IG slowly but surely will be deleted. First they started with invasion of privacy ,, &amp; now taking your influential impact feature seen through likes.. but ok. Peace to ya  Cant wait for a social media truly made for the people "
Mad Mom. I am not very happy with your app. I got hacked and I cant even recover this with my phone number because they change the number on me. Plus on top of this the hacker has sent messages to my personal family and other people. Saying I want money from them just go to this app of hacking and you can have this money. I am very upset I have tried to do a new Instagram new email and I cant even get in touch with people. My email that got hacked and my phone number too. I tried to report it to you guys and you did nothing at all. And now I have to deal with not being able to communicate with my family and friends. I am so angry with you and Instagram that you were supposed to help people who get hacked.MAD MOM HERE
"Mutuals. Honestly the app is fine and all but Id appreciate it if you guys would make it say mutuals or friends instead of saying following, its easier for me to keep track of who I need to unfollow.Another thing is I have 3 accounts logged into the app and my main account doesn&#39;t have some of the features my other account has"
"Good app but Support ignores you. I love the app but whenever there is an issue, it is next to impossible to get help. My account has been compromised countless times (no idea why and I keep changing my password) and Instagram temporarily blocks all of my actions (liking, commenting, following). I think its incredibly unfair to punish users based on being hacked. I did nothing against terms of service. I have two Instagram accounts (personal and professional) and both get temporarily blocked due to only one of my accounts being hacked. It doesnt make sense. And its VERY unprofessional for Instagram support to ignore user issues"
Please make a new update. Instagram is tweaking. It needs an update or something. Nothing is loading and its irritating me. No its not my WiFi or my service. I have all full bars &amp; using my unlimited data
My account was hacked. My account has been hacked. And Instagram has been literally sending me in circles to get access to my account. You think a billion dollar app would make it easier for you to get it back. But nope. They go out of their way to make it impossible to report your account as even hacked and even harder for you to be able to get your account back. Most people whove been through what Im dealing with ended up losing their account and all their memories along with it. Which is heartbreaking. It shouldnt be that easy to hack into someones account or for someone to prove they are who they say
Instagram isnt it for me right now. Instagram wont let me see my notifications and its bugging me I keep deleting the app and re adding it/ resetting my phone its weird I have 2 Instagrams a personal one and a food one and the food one lets me see my notifications but my personal one wont let me and it barely started doing that this past week and I dont know why Ive gone on Instagram to report the problem twice now and no one has got back to me or fixed the problem. Im so not happy with Instagram
"Stop the forced messenger. I dont want messenger on my phone. Stop popping up alerts asking me to enable it. I do not trust my privacy with you and I know messenger has privacy concerns. Introduce and option for never wanting itAlso, why is it that a women taking a photo of her body is taken down but when I report a video of a person using a shot guys to blow his head off, its not a violation.That is sick and twisted. Check your morals Instagram"
"Not required. Dear Instagram, Thank you but no thank you for providing/flooding my feeds with the posts which you feel I may like as I had liked something similar or relevant to that.I am happy with what I like and I cant navigate it myself if I want pages to like or posts. For your information, you are pushing me to stop liking the posts as you are tracking my likes and flooding my feed..Please revert those changesYour Instagrammer"
"ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Beware If you own a business or plan on using Instagram for growing your brand, just a word of warning: Instagram will delete your account with no warning and then refuse to provide any type of customer support. Get hacked? Good luck, they DO NOT CARE"
Data sucking hoarding gits. Id rather pay a modest fee than let you scrape my every move for data
"Views and Likes. It is hard to market as a personal trainer/business when I post and people cant see it. However, you favor others for the same post despite content. It would be nice to go back getting views and likes from the entire IG community and not just your followers"
"Login. Ive had my account for well over 5 years now. Recently, I was logged out of my account and though I correctly used my login information and on the same device Ive used for over a year, I was asked to put in a pin sent to an old phone number. I dont have access to this number, but I know my password to Instagram. Customer service is horrid. I wouldnt give any stars if I had the choice. I have memories going back almost 8 years, including both of my children, my wedding, loved ones who are no longer here, etc. After 4 emails asking to verify my identity with a picture of myself and a code they sent, I was sent an email that reads:  Hi,We cant give you access to this account or continue to process your request because we havent received an acceptable image to verify account ownership.Thanks I cant believe this is the best they can do for me.Again, Id give 0 stars if I could"
Someone hacked into my account and Instagram did nothing. Someone hacked into my account. I guess you could call it a spam account where I post pictures of stuff I do for my closer friends. Someone somehow hacked into it and changed the email. A lot of my personal pictures are in there and Ive reported it to Instagram only to receive a response that said the account most likely wont be removed??? Ive asked my personal friends to also report this account and if the technology was better Instagram would be able to tell that my account got hacked into but I guess not
Review. So on Monday I deleted insta cause my phone was taken and then on wensday night I tried downloading it again and so I did and when I tried to add my info to log into my account its taken me out of the app and on to my home screen every time and I dont know what to do
"Download this app. Its so fun and safe if you wanna follow someone it requests them so you dont follow someone random and you can make your account private, have more accounts, and post pictures you can text and Video chat its so useful and fun download now no time to waste"
"Great app to watch square adds. If you like watching ads, and you like to watch them in a small square enclosure in portrait mode, while at the same time donating all your personal data to facebook, then this app is perfect for you. Only problem is that some people seem not able to resist to post their own personal pictures there, interrupting ther  feed of ads and distracting you from square ad watching"
"I have to restart my phone (Literally I need to erase the phone data). BECAUSE Instagram makes a black screen when I tap the profile button. This happened a few months ago, too. It happened again  Please fix this or I will uninstall the app "
"Hacked accounts. Instagram, as a billion dollar company, is a joke when it comes to security, customer service, support center, etc. My account has been hacked and its been a disaster trying to recover it. I have someone from Nigeria trying to extort me asking how much Ill pay to get it back. Instagram has no human you can speak to. Just emailing an automated email over and over. Not to mention when you report the msgs / account theres no option for this account has been hacked . There is this is spam, this is harassment etc. but nothing for being hacked. When you FINALLY get to the point where you can send a video selfie to confirm your account, there is no option for if you dont have pictures of yourself on your account . My account is a business account. Im a dog trainer, so its all pictures of dogs. So theres literally no option for me to get my account back. This hacker is extorting me and family, and not mention killing my small business. Do better Instagram. This is ridiculous"
Weird update or something. I am having an issue where I am no longer prompted to select the photos to which I want instagram having access to. I very much liked this feature and the change put me in the position of wasting time by going to the menu or putting personal info at risk by giving instagram access to all my pictures.Really unhappy with the change
"Account disabled. My account got disabled for using Instagram to login into an app from the App Store to track my followers. I didnt know this wasnt allowed. However, Ive been trying to appeal to get my account back and no response. Worst customer support Ive ever seen"
Sells Your Data. Sells your data
"Self Sabotage. this app keeps getting worse and worse. everyday i grow closer to deleting my whole account. every additional feature they add is worse than the last. Theres no way they dont know that theyre destroying themselves either. with the invasive amount of data they have on us, they should know better than to make these horrible additions to the app"
"Ridiculous. Instagram is so whack. The app has been around for so many years, rolled out so many useless updates that no one asked for but has yet to add  a feature that allows us to see who unfollowed us/inactive followers. Were banned from using third party apps that allow us to track our unfollowers, so now Im trying to go through my followers and check manually and Ive just been blocked from doing that as well. What even is this? Im going to Twitter"
Privacy. #GazaUnderAttack
"It just gets worse and worse. Im so sick of the updates. I have multiple accounts and some and the updated tool tab where you have to go to your home feed to find your notifications and its awful. Luckily my main account doesnt have this update on his somehow. However, Facebook and Instagram basically forced me to connect the two of them which I hate. If I dont connect them I constantly have to go through these sets before opening messages etc. and now that I finally did it, Instagram took the liberty to update my birthday on my profile after getting it from Facebook abs I cannot change it remove it unless I do it on Facebook first. I have a much smaller circle on fb so I dont mind more personal info on it but Instagram has a lot of people I dont personally know and I chose to keep certain information about myself private but thats no longer an option. Im sure somewhere in the fine print of the update I agreed for them to share info between the two but thats not the issue. The issue is them doing it at all. We all know you have to do the updates or these apps will make it impossible for you to navigate them until youre forced to make the switch. Both Facebook and Instagram just constantly get worse and worse and all these new features and sharing do is make it harder to be in control of YOUR account"
"lost its substance. instagram isnt even designed for seeing friends and family&#39;s posts anymore. It&#39;s filled with ads, unnecessary amounts of reels, and literally has a whole section for shopping now??? Anything personal to your instagram is found on your home page and discourages me to even use instagram anymore. The insights aren&#39;t helpful at all anymore and engagement hes seriously declined. ik people use instagram to promote their business but we already had an excess amount of ads and promotions, and instagram really ruined it with the shopping page"
Really enjoy posting to the people that I choose to show. A great app that works for me  Love the privacy
Insta. Can someone help me . My instagram just doesnt have a notification button so I never get notifications so I guess when ppl text me . I have tried everything and its annoying me now . I never get messages pop up on my phone . Someone help 
"New update. New update is awful, struggle to understand why shopping is prioritised over your own notifications. For me Instagram is a personal social media not one for online shopping, terrible layout and too complicated"
Incorrectly disabled account without warning. Instagram have disabled my account of 10 years. There was no warning and they have not reviewed my appeals. They have also retained my data. They pride themselves on transparency however they are reluctant to hand over my intersect it property. Please review my account as this is uncalled for
Why. I like Instagram I really do. The problem is that whenever I try to get on it and refresh the feed nine times out of ten it says it cant refresh because of an error. It doesnt get fixed on my WiFi or data
"Poor Support: >1 month and my account is still broken. I have reported issues many times over the past month but my Instagram account is broken. I cannot see my feed, account attributes, settings, or anything. There is no indication of my account being deactivated as my friends can see my account just fine.I can not access on the web or the app, I have deleted and redownloaded, I tried on WiFi and I tried using data.I have tried all the possible solutions given in the help center and have tried reporting issues several times"
"SUGGESTION FOR INSTAGRAM. Hey,Can you change the privacy by making users followers invisible like Facebook has. In Facebook you can choose who can see your friends(followers) and also you can change it anytime.Its just a suggestion. I would be happy to see the new update.Thank you"
Instagram. This Is unbelievable. I can not download this app anymore. I need feedback
"Hacking and stealing account is getting WORSE . Their no easy / realistic / safe method to get your account back from thievesTo get back your account, you should not have to give so much private info just to post pics of my dog If its a popular or celebrity account I understand the extra ID requirements etc. Seems like the thieves have INSIDE HELP from INSTAGRAM"
"WONT LET ME CHANGE PROFILE. Wont let me change my profile so I cant change my bio, my profile pic or my privacy settings :( everytime it says something went wrong. please fix this . Other than that its fire"
"Pro: fairly easy to use. Con: a cellular data hog. I like the generally good picture quality and ease of use. OTOH, the default settings on my iPhone app were using a ton of cellular data and making me go over my data plan until I figured out how to change them"
Sharing. The app does not let me share posts to my story despite the account being public and what not. It doesnt give me the option to share posts to my story. It works on my food blog page but not on my personal account
Im so upset. My Instagram @Amandacitaa got hacked and I cant reach Instagram at all All my wedding photos and important personal information are on there INSTAGRAM PLEASE HELP I did not want to make this review I love the app but please it shouldnt be this hard for us to retrieve our accounts. Please help. Thank you 
"Evil app. Your algorithms are killing people. You perpetuate a story even if its fake, and even if it causes polarization against one group of people. Your app is evil and ethically bankrupt. You spy on your users, allow fake news to spread them dont do anything to stop it. Yours collusion with dictatorships is also evident. Its sad as this would have been a great way to communicate"
"Stop releasing unnecessary updates people complain about. Why are you making me scroll up just to check if someone has dmed me, can you just not update instagram every week and make it either inconvenient and uglier than it already is? Fix facebook privacy settings before you release useless updates that everyone hates"
"Profile Picture. I cant change my profile picture and has been several months that the app dont let me change it. When I try to change it the message I get is error , verified your connection when I have unlimited data. My data works fine in other apps , instagram is the only one who seems to not work very well. Hope this gets fix soon "
Too many ads. I took some time off of insta...and came back to discover exponentially more advertisements and a departure from the original share photos and short video content platform. It feels less personal and more corporate than ever
Likes and Dislikes. When I was just using Instagram as a personal way to catch up with my friends and see silly videos Instagram was a solid 4. The algorithm was annoying and I hate how I cant preference how I want to see my page but whatever. I could still deal. But I made a new page recently that is more of a blog that Im trying to get followers on and Instagram is making that IMPOSSIBLE for someone to do their right way. Woke up this morning with 9 new followers so I followed them back and I have not use a single 3rd party app but I just got pushed out of my account with them saying I used a 3rd party app for likes and followers when that was just me in the morning following people back and liking photos. I am CONSISTENTLY getting soft blocked from liking pictures and adding people because I guess I do it too much but isnt that the point of Instagram? And the crazy part is I dont even do it that much How am I supposed to build a following if you wont even let me ENGAGE with people like Im supposed to I I dont know what Instagram needs to do to fix this but I hope they know I will continuously report problems any time they soft block me because its not fair or right and if I ever lose my page when I havent done a single thing wrong Id just be done with the whole app
Hi everyone. I wanna take a moment to thanks instagram for increasing business one of the best app thats you can share personal and business photos and videos I really appreciated
Personal data being stolen. So I didnt update my app but the new updates features still changed on my app? Hmmmm; deleting because you obviously are infringing on personal data laws
"Trouble accessing my Instagram account. Ive had a similar situation and this is happened again not quite sure whats causing this I think, my account as been hacked. Im unable to access any information on my Instagram. Ive sent an email to Instagram. I still havent received any response please can you help me out"
"Privacy is horrible. So, like I was doing a challenge and we had to switch accounts for a day and.. now I think this person has my address. Honestly just. Dont switch accounts on social media platforms"
"Losing the essence. Instagram is a PICTURES app, TIKTOK is a VIDEOS app, STOP trying to steal everything from everybody. This is so ridiculous and nobody will use it. Nobody will stop to use TikTok because of the stupid reels idea. Be better. Dont get jealous of other successes apps. Youre just being a jealous loser and everybodys will quit"
Hacked and back. Unfortunately I apparently didnt have a two factor protection on my original account and somebody from Nigeria hacked me. I was able to create another account but had to start all over. They hacker was blackmailing me and there was nobody to help me. At least not without a huge price which I didnt have the money for because he also hacked my bank accounts. I did not give him any information he stole my information because I didnt have the two factor on. And then Instagram my new account wouldnt allow me to respond to messages or send messages out end it was a bad experience but I am back and hopefully I find a lesson and I can put it out there to other people. Everyone needs to know when they sign up to protect their account with the two factor
"Ad revenue hungry. I understand how resource consuming it must be to run one of the largest social media platforms. However it seems over the years the platform has turned to be more advertisement friendly than consumer friendly. The suggested feed offers the exact same feature as the discover tab, except loaded with advertisements and sponsored pages. It seems a bit much to incorporate unwanted posts/pages into the main feed when the discover tab offers the same feature. Instead of being focused on a connected experience it rather offers an endless scroll feed to collect more data and ad revenue. Please re-evaluate"
"Hacker Friendly. Instagram has let a hacker take my account, steal my identity, photos, and friends. A friend started posting a couple of pictures about Fortex trading, when I private messages them to say it was cool they told me that I should get with their mentor, and that it was really safe. After a couple of days they private messaged me saying my mentor wants to give $500 to all of my followers and asked me to change my email address in my personal settings. Not realizing that they were trying to hack me I did as they asked. After a couple of minutes I was logged out of my account and could not get back in. They were very pushy and what they were asking. Both my friend and I had private accounts. This happened December 7, 2021 and Ive been trying to get my account back ever since.After they took my account they then extended the exact same hack to my followers, and I can not even warn them. I made a report to Instagram and they are not doing anything about it, and I cant contact Instagram to get help"
DMV Balloons. I love Instagram Its great source of communication for personal and business use Great quality
Every 3-4 posts = 1 ad. Too many ads to enjoy. Number of ads are increasing and getting worse every day. Feeling like invasion of privacy giving me ads for thing si look up outside of the app. Feeling like I cant have separate spaces on my phone
I still have this problem since I got instagram and no one has helped me. I got instagram in june or july of 2019 and it was really fun and I talk to all my friends and we share photos. But I cannot share other peoples posts to my story unless Im tagged in it when other people can. I made another account just to see what the option looked like and I just want to know why that works on that account and not my account I post on. On that account if i go through settings and privacy and story I get the option to allow resharing and that is not even an option for my account so I wanna know what the issue is. I sent this issue to instagram a few times and nothing has changed can I get some help?
INSTAGRAM HELP IS USELESS. My account was hacked and the person completely change all my information so I cannot log back in. Ive tried submitting a video(s) to confirm my identity and the response is that they cannot confirmed it. I cant even use the help buttons anymore. This is completely frustrating. I have old fotos that I would hate to lose Im irritated to the max
"Goodbye data. Very Sad how your data is taken and sold, for simple sake of control and profit"
Invasion of privacy and new terms. The new terms of service are taking it too far and exploiting the people using the app. I no longer feel that I can even use the app for entertainment. And the fact that the app was monitoring users without consent is horrifying. I suggest everyone delete the app
Add yours sticker. I have been reporting and trying to reach someone about not having add yours and I cant click on anyones. My old page was hacked and Instagram did nothing to get it back after I verified I was me lost a lot of family pictures. Add family members scammed. I wish Instagram would do better with support
DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Doesnt even let me report serious threat private messages I get from spam accounts. F*** FACEBOOK AND ZUCKERBERG
Stories. It is no longer letting me share posts from my newsfeed to my story.. not even my own personal posts from my newsfeed. Is it a way to change the settings on the app?
"Poor Customer Support/ Too many hacked accounts. My account was hacked over a week ago. I have tried to use the forget username password, need more help, video authentication, code authentication, help center tips etc and to no avail. The scammers/hackers have taken over my account and I no longer have access.  Many of my followers have reported the account but Instagram claims the account users arent breaking community guidelines. Clearly theyre using bots to send out the same message to people who email a report.These people have hacked numerous accounts and are posting fraudulent content; investment opportunities like crypto currency and Bitcoin. They have stolen money from people as well and IG has done nothing to help. Theyre using people\'s profiles to manipulate other people and con them into business opportunities.Ive watched numerous videos on YouTube whereas many Instagram users have been hacked as well and havent received any support from Instagram. Why would a company thats worth billions treat people like this? There should be a legitimate method to help the IG users who have been victimized/ scammed. I posted a message regarding this matter on FB AND on Twitter. I tagged IG/FB/Meta and my DMs and comments were flooded by scammers and not a soul from IG/FB/Meta reached outWho can I communicate with to help me regain access to my account?"
"Laziness. sorry, there was an issue with your request.I can log in online or on someone elses phone but not on my app. Ive uninstalled it. removed all my data from it, nothing is working. There is no result on the instagram support for this issue and there is no way to contact anyone. If you look through other social media accounts people have had this issue for multiple years/ months etc. but have not heard back from instagram at all.Its absolutely shocking because theres clearly multiple people with this issue and there is not only no way to fix it but no one to contact to get a specific request for help"
"Ability to share tagged stories removed. For some reason after having Instagram for a while, I no longer have the option in my settings/privacy to have others share my story if I tag them, with a private account. This wasnt an issue before and I have friends with private accounts who do not have this problem, but for me the option does not show up unless Im public. Id like to have this feature while being a private account"
"Too many hackers. This is overall my of my favorite apps dont get me wrong, but ive had hundreds of messages from random accounts trying to hack into my profiles, or asking for help links because they cant log into their insta several of my friends accounts have been hacked because they unknowingly opened a friends help link thinking it was their friend. Ive had my teachers from when i was in elementary school message me talking about fake money flipping facilities and what not. Now obviously theres the original hacking where its a link saying Oh my god is this you or  This took me 3 hours to make. I hope you like it, with a link that only temporarily hacks your account and sends it to all of your followers and friends, but now its hackers who ask for help and then convince you to open a help link and it makes it so that they can completely hack your instagram account and use it to trick more people into being hacked or loosing money along with their personal information such as their phone number, email, birth date, name, and if youre really unlucky and connected a card into the autofill thats associated with the app, therefore also loosing your money. I truly do love Instagram dont get me wrong but when i have 10 people messaging me in 5 minutes about help links in an attempt to hack me it gets frustrating"
Hacked. My account has been hacked with my childrens pictures on it with fraudulent activity and Instagram has no way of removing this account after being reported several times  Disgraceful that someone can hack into all your personal business change all your details and have pictures of you and your children and Instagram cant do nothing or help in anyway
"Self sabotaging company. One of my profiles has the search option in the top right hand corner, and inbox at the bottom. The other profile has it the opposite way around. Over the last few years this keeps changing back and forth, MAKE UP YOUR MINDS The Not interested button literally does nothing other than feed into the data Facebook collects, it doesn't make crappy posts go away. I could go on for hours but I'll summarise by saying this app was better before Facebook Meta bought it and ruined it, like everything else they touch"
Why more personal info?. Cannot use the app unless you provide your Birthday?  Why?? Guess I will be deleting the app
"Cant hide following/followers lists. This is the only reason I dont use this app anymore. Its just a dealbreaker.. Isnt Instagram owned by Facebook? Facebook has an option to hide your friends list even from people on your friends list. I would use Instagram if only there was an option to hide my following/followers lists to everybody, even people on those lists, similar to Facebook. This feature along with being able to hide who likes your post from everybody would give me the privacy I feel comfortable withIt would be nice to be able to interact freely with my family, friends, Tinder matches.. All on the same platform but not risk them interacting with each other"
"No thanks. Dear Instagram, I dont want to shop on your app. I come to share content and to be inspired by content and you have made those two activities harder by trying to center the app around shop and reels. Additionally, please stop showing me feels and Instagram life videos from days and weeks ago. If I wanted to watch them, I would have Honestly I dont even understand how a reel is any different than other Instagram videos. Why does it need its own location?? I have honestly used the app for both my personal and my artist accounts less since these changes have been made because its just obnoxious and more difficult"
"Fave. Quite honestly my fave social media app It has everything Lots of visual, a place to share images, turn sound on or off to suit you and your surroundings, short story bursts or IGTV - Live and recorded streamings to watch, great personal message system - good privacy settings and able to follow friends, celebs, others alike - a good place to discover new talents. Only downside is very difficult to reach anyone behind the sceens (I was hacked once and frustraiting not to reach anyone)Otherwise Fab app"
"Easy and fun. This app is well known for laughter,conversation, and getting to know people real identity love instagram"
"Gee thanks for the heads up. I just found out that someone logged into my account several days ago from 8 states away but I was NEVER notified I only found out because I logged in tonight and just happened to catch the warning.Where is the security? Why wasnt an email or text notification sent to me to let me know? I dont use that account every day because its a personal one but now Im worried about my business account that I use constantly. A little heads up would have been nice. Also,Algorithms are a joke, no one is seeing my posts and the spam comments are insane. The latest update mutes music on reels and stories, even when turned on. Im struggling enough trying to promote my business and now no one is seeing my posts I went from hundreds to dozens and now one or two. One reel will get almost 2000 views and the next 15. Trying to keep head above water during this crazy time is bad enough but now you are just screwing with us. I finally went back to a personal account from my business one as more and more features were getting taken away from the business feature. Absolutely unfair. Also, the spam has gotten out of control. Not just the crap comments and DMs about using their promotion services but now they are constantly emailing me as well. I try to report/block and delete but I had one post last week that had four comments telling me to promote on such and such an account...all different user names but all the same service."
"Login issue, help center. I had changed my phone number, 8 months ago and changed in in fb as well. However, as I though my info from fb will sync with insta I did not change my phone number in instagram account. I cannot access my account as it sends code to my previous number. I did provide them with my photo and the code they sent through email but no success. It has been three weeks that I don&#39;t have access and have not received any response from help center either. "
"Move post button and notifications back to there original spot. Why Would a social media app made for posting pictures for followers replace there posting and notifications with a shipping tab and reels? If I wanted to shop I wouldnt go on Instagram. I go on Instagram to post and see friends post. All I see are dumb adds. I dont even get to see the people that i followed anymore Its always recommended posts in my main feed. If thats the case what the point of a follow button? Just put back the post and notifications. Seriously, I get it you want to make money, but dont forget why this app was so great and why so many people loved it before its too late. Sincerely a disappointed user"
"No longer have option to Allow Resharing to Stories. Instagram users have 3 sharing privacy options. But not me, I have 2. My allow resharing to stories option was removed arbitrarily 3 months ago and I have not been able to get it back. I tag my friends in my stories and they receive no option from me to add to story. I cant turn the feature on because I dont even have the option in my settings Ive reported this issue and submitted to the support team several times and have received no response. Its really disappointing"
"Works Fine but Lost Value. Instagram prides itself on giving users a quick and easy way to share a moment. That its free from clutter. But Ive seen engagement cut in half. And recently IG stopped showing me in-feed previews of stories from people I follow in order to show me suggested reelz from accounts I dont. Well, now I dont watch either. I constantly miss notifications now that the heart moved. The search tab is spot on for my interests, Ill give IG that Keep it there and leave my homepage intimate and personal. Spending less and less time on this app"
Easy to assess and use. i like how easy it is to use and that the privacy settings are rlly good too :D
Unfollowing app through Instagram. Can yall create a app to help us get rid of people who isnt following us then us downloading app that hacks our account like app like layout
"Instagram Support doesnt help at all. My account has been hacked for awhile by some random person since my login activity shows a different location and my followers/following change. I have tried everything from using Instagram support, the Duo Mobile app, changing passwords, removing my email and even disabling my own account if I could get them kicked out of the account but whoever is hacking doesnt seem to stop. I have also sent requests from both accounts weeks ago and I have no response. It got to the point where they even got to hack my backup which is really frustrating especially since I have that account incase I were to get hacked. Im left wondering if they are still hacking because of my phone number thats provided in my profile or if they are actually following me on one of the accounts. It has got to me to the point where Im thinking of deleting the accounts if this hacker doesnt want to get off for some reason. Instagram ACTUALLY PUT CONTACT INFORMATION such as an email and phone number because for me Instagram support did not help at all and made things worst. Please fix this"
"What was once of the best has become spam central. Back in the day Instagram was amazing. You could grow organically. All you had to do was share pictures drop some hashtags and boom growth. Unfortunately that seems like eons ago. They have sold out so pathetically much. Every other post is a sponsored paid post. Every three stories is a sponsored paid story. They have made it more and more clear you MUST pay to get any reach. If you dont pay, you could have 50k followers and still barely get 1000 likes on a post.They also said, forget pictures, were gonna try and be the next TikTok. Sorry, yall but your reels functionality is incredibly weak against TikTok. Finally, if none of that irritates you, they seem to not care even the slightest that spam accounts are completely taking over. You can make a single post without getting over 5 spam accounts commenting promote here (insert spam account). Or the spam accounts will constantly tag you in spam posts. Oh and each time a spam account comments on your content, it hurts your reach even further.Instagram truly does not care about its users anymore. Only the ones who want to pay. But wait If you pay to sponsor a post. All of your non-paid posts will forever suffer to keep you paying for reach. Instagram is dead, bury it, consider it mercy"
"The Good and the Bad of Instagram. As a personal and business user I love the way Instagram connects you with old friends and people whom you would never come across from far and wide. What saddens me deeply is the way that Instagram allows online bullying. I have witnessed members of my family experiencing this on a daily basis. Come on Instagram you are better than this, stop the online bullies"
Instagram hacked and cannot contact anyone. My Instagram was hacked and I had to add a new one. Cannot call or email anyone When I reported they said info not - not appropriate. All my pics and old posts now under harambeeyouth youth.  Social media ???
No more tracking. Ive had it with all the tracking & notifications Ive been getting. I just deleted this app and others like this. Advertisers need to stop this so I can enjoy my family & friends again
"A failing app. Ive used Instagram for business for close to 11 years. Its become almost essential for me to use it. Within the last month, my account was randomly deleted, along with multiple friends accounts being deleted or hacked. None of the people, including myself, posted anything against the guidelines or received any warnings. I now have hundreds of clients reaching out confused, lost appointments, lost info, and thousands of people with no idea where to contact me. To make matters worse, Instagram has no customer service. It is impossible to talk to a human to explain my situation. Their programs are riddled with bugs. I tried to recover the account via email and it sent me a 7 digit number and asked for a 6 digit code. Ive tried to send a recovery text to my phone number for weeks and still havent received a single one. My friends that had their accounts hacked are in the same boat. Even now, there are people posting scams from their hacked accounts and they are unable to recover them with their phone number or email. Instagram has no problem storing your sensitive private information like address, phone number, or payment info, but when theyre questioned about providing more security or customer service they cite that theyre a free app and we dont HAVE to give them any information. I finally decided to give up and create a new account, starting from scratch after 11 years and thousands of followers. To make matters worse, when trying to set up my email and phone number to secure this account, Im running into the same bugs. Its out of control. So for now, Ill use Instagram because it is a necessity. But with this kind of service, the amount of bugs, and the amount of frustration its causing myself and countless others, soon this app will be left in the dust with a more user friendly alternative to take its place. I cant wait"
Cant find the pictures that I sent to achieves. Every thing been good in the past 5 plus yrs I been on ig. However it has been a few things wrong recent. Looks like my phone  been hacked. Need some help looking into this cuz some of my lady friends been getting sexual comments from whom ever buy with my account information.  Thx
"Design Flaws and Terrible Help Center Support. My account was hack I have tried everything that the support and help center recommended. Ive tried the selfie video method, and their facial recognition algorithm said I didnt match my photos that I posted on my Instagram page. I tried calling HQ and tweeting the CEO, co-founders, and CTO. NO response, NO solution, and still NO access to my account. Im a highly unsatisfied in the quality of support from Meta especially as a customer with a large fan base/followers"
Likes. I feel like you should keep the ability to see the number of likes not only are you blocking from seeing others you cant see your own amount. Many people have posts that say get this post to ~ likes so after being able to see it for so long its really frustrating not having it. It could at least be a personal setting for if the person wants others to see or not. I also feel like itd be a really helpful feature to be able to delete just one picture/video out of an album when posting. Ie when someone posts prom pictures on Facebook they can delete one individual picture without getting rid of the whole post
"Horrible support. My accounts were hacked and there is no way to directly contact support. I created a new account and for 3 days I have messaged the official Instagram page , I submitted reports and reported my accounts but Instagram is refusing to help it is saying my pages to her were hacked are not violating guidelines but they are Someone hacked my accounts and is messaging people impersonating me trying to get money and gift cards. I lost years of memories and my childrens photos. Fix your support Instagram you seem to be helping the hackers and not the people who actually need your help. ImSo disappointed"
Cant see who saves my posts. I think that Instagram should show you which accounts saved your posts and not just how many did especially for smaller personal accounts
Hack. Instagram isnt very helpful in attempting to help you save the account and retrieve it back to its original account owner. It does how tips on how to change password but other then that they arent helpful and you end up creating a new account and loose all prior pictures and conversations
Too many issues with my personal account. I will be boycotting this app until they allow me to both see the number of likes there are on posts as well as allow me to like all and any photos I want to like. As of today I have run into the second issue where instagram literally has stopped me from liking certain posts that I enjoy. I have already been their test subject against my will as I cant see the number of likes on a post as many other accounts can but now Im getting more issues. Reddit is a better site and I will be using that instead
Urgent. Instagram have to fix that hacking situation cause some hacked my instagram and changed all my info
"Support needs to be better. I have been using Instagram for yearsssss, and recently got my Instagram hacked. I just got an email saying my password was changed and email changed no confirmation email or approval for this. There is no actual person to talk to so I reported it and they asked me to make a video of my face and they would contact me in 1-2 days. NEVER received contact back and I couldnt get my Instagram back. I had a lot of memories that and chats I cant access because the hacker blocked my new account and family and friends. Ridiculous"
"I just deleted my IG accounts and went to Vero. Vero is a much better-designed app, blows IG out of the water. Plus, Vero is pro-free speech and privacy. They even encrypt your communication with your friends. Vero doesnt use creepy algorithms to steal and monazite your personal data. They also wont turn on your camera and mic to spy on you when youre on the toilet grunting out last night&#39;s Taco  Bell. You can also share more than photos and videos too Also, the people on Vero are of a higher caliber. Go for quality over quantity. Youll feel happier on Vero"
"8 years user review. Pretty cool social media app overall. It has changed a lot through the years. For the coming future, please add a feature to edit (add/delete) pictures posted on a carousel. That way we dont have to delete the entire post. I also would like for it to be able to have a feature to track at least who unfollowed you. No need for third-party apps"
Its great. Its great but my personal Instagram account wont update to the new across messaging feature but when I go into my business account it has the whole new update I just want to have the update on my personal account as well
"Just do it for everyone. I think  it would be better if we can upload pictures photos on the comments section just do it. sometimes like I wanna show all friends something , not only on private message do it simple on the comments section too"
Ok app. The app is OK and its good to see how people are doing but when someones account gets hacked like mine did. I reached out to a Instagram I emailed their security team I gave them everything that they needed and they did not help me try to get my account back and it is not fair when I worked really hard on that account and now I have to take all those pictures and put them on my other account
"Horrible Customer Service. My account was temporarily locked due to suspicious activity (i got hacked) There was no clear way to resolve this problem. I submitted multiple requests for support and only got one auto-generated email back. I responded will all the correct info they were asking for but, i have yet to have a response. Its been 5 months since Ive been locked out of my account. Instagram doesnt care about its users enough to provide a working support email, or a faster service to solve problems. Instead they suggest using the help center which has vague answers and doesnt address every question. In my situation the help center has done nothing for me. Instagrams lack of customer service care is appalling considering how much revenue they make. They care about collecting money  and leeching off everyday people"
"Still cant share posts. Honestly I love Instagram on my personal account, I have all the features but I cant for whatever goddamn reason share PUBLIC and ENABLED posts to my story on my business account But can on my personal. This is INFURIATING"
The spy gram. New terms of service are a joke openly spying on your users
"If you get hacked say bye to your account. Long story short I got hacked, changed my password and added 2 step verification to prevent being hacked again so instagram locked me out and because I no longer have access to the email or phone number i used to sign up 6 or so years ago I have no way of getting my account back. They have no customer service or any way to contact them its really annoying"
"My escape from isolation. I joined Instagram at the encouragement of a friend at the beginning of the Covid crisis when I was actually sick with Flu type A. With no ability to meet people in person, I needed an outlet for socializing. Also, being retired, my personal contacts have been limited to family in person and former colleagues via text and email. Facebook proper has NEVER been an option for me to join. LINKEDIN is too focused on marketing. And other sites are just vehicles for complaining. Instagram fit my needs more than I ever would have suspected. I not only get to share where I am in life visually, but I have built a network of artists, artisans gardeners and designers that constantly delights me. People are sharing their passions, big and small, in unassuming ways. And I love it. We create our own Instagram world by who we follow and by who is then recommend, by who follows us, and by our own intentions. I no longer feel isolated. "
Battery drain. Either the app security is remiss or this app spends a significant amount of time prying through system files of your devices. I read the entire privacy policy and know without a doubt the latter; is more plausible
"Insists on me providing a phone number. Insists on me providing a phone number to unlock my account. I dont want them to have my phone number, especially given their previous data breach"
Switching from Professional/Personal. Instagram puts a limit on the amount of times you can switch from a personal profile to a professional profile. This is incredibly frustrating - needs to be resolved
"10 YEAR OLD personal account disabled. Ive never had an issues with Instagram until three days ago when my personal account that Ive had for 10 years was disabled claiming that I was impersonating myself. I even had to send my ID which is super sketchy and ridiculous. With only an incredibly slow help center to take my complaints I have now found myself worried that I will lose the connections Ive made with so many friends over the years. When I search for my account or photos Ive been tagged in, its like my account was never even there. Ive NEVER been so annoyed with a social media app And this hasnt happened to anyone I know. This new update needs to be fixed ASAP"
Privacy. He have no option for privacy for example temporary story hide for certain option
"Facebook Ruined it. Was a great App,Until privacy peep and creep greedy Facebook bought it. Then they implanted all their adverts and creeping strategies.And just to top it off, they also made it the same as Facebook, when it comes to deleting your account...Skilfully made to be as difficult as possible. That cant be denied"
Please reactivate my account. I believe my account was disabled by mistake. I am the owner of team_south_florida_kennels I have had my account since 2016. I have a lot of personal photos and memories on there. I respect the rules of Instagram and I did not violate any of Instagrams community guidelines. Please reactivate my account
Favorite app. Ive been using this app for years and I love how I get to show photos and have my privacy
"Privacy settings do not work. I changed the privacy setting so that I have to approve any attempt to tag me in a post, but accounts are still able to tag me on posts without my permission. Reporting an account as spam no longer also blocks that account, like that notification says it did. I have to block them myself after reporting"
Bug report. This app doesnt even recognize you read the message. Lack of privacy anything you post is subject to Mark Zuckerberg making a profit off your post and images
"Not every account has the same features. Long story short. I have a personal account and a business account. My personal account doesnt have the same features for posting on IG story as my business account. For example, my personal account cant add music onto my IG story posts but my business account can. Ive read other reviews with the same issue. Ive also reported it multiple times through the in app customer complaints and have not heard back once. Its been over a year and still nothing. Ive had Instagram from the beginning of the app and it looks like the more OG your account is the least features youll get. Disappointing"
"just. delet orther developer or temporate account.privacy and safe account delet report all orther and ads,report and delet ads"
Zero Stars If I Could. When scrolling everyone other post is a stupid add. I never actually see any of my friends pictures. I made a secondary account just to follow influencers and stuff so on my personal I can actually see people I want to see because the algorithm is so trash. Then this new update puts stupid reels and shopping on the bottom bar...why??? I hate reels and shopping. All Instagram wants is to make money. I wish theyd go back to chronological posts and stop trying to copy every other platform. Instagram keeps making updates that shows the obviously so not care about the everyday people using the app and only want to make money
"No help or contact. If your account was hacked and you lost access to it, there is no way to contact instagram and get it recovered. Its all automated messages no real person to talk to"
"The New Update Ruins Everything. Everything good about Instagram was just ruined by the newest update. Watch 10 seconds of a video and instead of finishing the video, it pauses and you have to push a button to watch the rest but it replays the whole video after it goes to a different screen. Now theyre trying to be like Facebook market place and sell products on the app. It makes no sense and its terrible"
Saying your protecting community?. I just redownloaded and for some reason when I unfollow it says this action cannot be done right now. When All im doing it just unfollowing people i dont want to or downloading a picture its on my main and spam account
Forcing data tracking ios14.5. Dont force us to agree with IG tracking the data from our phone after the ios upDate14.5. One of the few apps that forces us to agree the data tracking to use the app. Messed up
"No support when hacked. My account got hacked 2 days ago and the IG help and support pages are a joke. I have reported the profile as pretending to be some one else (me) and so have many friends and family members. The message I get back from Instagram said that the account is doing nothing wrong. We have also reported every story the hacker has posted (a crypto currency scam) and nothing. I have emailed their phishing department, their security department, filled out multiple forms from their help page, taken a video selfie, reported it as a hacked account, tried to report it as copyright infringement as they are using my intellectual property with out my permission, and even called and left a message Instagram truly doesnt care about hacked accounts or scams/fraud on their platform. The email they are supposed to send when your personal contact info gets changed (email and phone number) which would give you an option to reverse the change never got sent to me.  Any way if your account gets hacked unless youre just a lucky person, good luck getting it back"
"Pathetic. You follow this so follow that You follow them so follow this Then they ban you from following because you follow too many people in one day, MORONS There are literally billions of people in the world and Im banned for trying to follow ten of them in one day I went to school with 1000 people and Ive met countless others in my life but somehow Im endangering peoples privacy by requesting to follow them Theyre just terrified  somebody else might make a penny they dont, fake ads that try to rip people off are fine but trying to link to your friends which is what the app is supposed to be there for is unusual behaviour wow get a life isnt billions of dollars enough for you you sad little man"
"Appraisal. the application is very goog but there is  a problem with privacy when I want to show my stories, highlight stories and posts without accept follow requests autmatically"
"Locked out of my account. Theres no one at Instagram support to help. Also, dont use duo mobile as your 3rd party authenticator I was locked out of my personal account because I temporarily disabled my account for a social media break. Ive been trying to get ahold of someone from Instagram support for 4 months with no avail. How does a company this big not have loads of support staff"
My Account Was Hacked. I Was Sent A Link That Was Of No Use.Nobody From Instagram Reached Out To Me To Solve My Problem.There Customer Service Skills Is 0.I Lost All My Contacts And Ive Requested My Money Back I Spent Promoting My Old Account.I Even Told Them I Was Suicidal As Someone Has My Personal Info And Still Nobody Contacted Me
"Instagram fan. Love the interactive updates, memes, inspiration and editing tools available. I am constantly being exposed to incredible art and news happening in real time that keeps me knowing the movement of human emotion and cognitive behavior in alignment with cultural events and astral almanac"
"Suggested Posts clutters following feed. I really dislike the Suggested Posts feature on the following feed. It blurs the line between who Im following and the explore screen. If I want to explore other accounts, I will just go to the explore tab. This feature makes Instagram less personal. I realize that this is probably an A/B test so it will be decided by data but I dislike this direction.Dear Instagram, please find other ways to increase engagement or revenue. Lets make Instagram more personal, not less"
"Making Changes No One Asked For. The new layout with the Reels and shopping tabs really shows how Instagram and the people in charge of Instagram simply dont care about User feedback and concerns. This apps main function is to post pictures and personal content. Since when did that main function become overlooked by shopping? By replacing the likes and notifications tab with a shopping tab that a majority of people wont even use, you guys are making the app LESS appealing to users. And the fact that Reels, a feature that is not even regularly used, replaced the post feature(LITERALLY THE MAIN REASON FOR INSTAGRAM) again shows how ignorant Instagram is of users concerns. If the app goes downhill its because of the tone-deafness of the team behind it"
anti-freedom of expression and privacy. The rules of this software are anti-freedom of expression and privacy
Problem. Instagram for the few past days has been changing the set up the app keeps asking me to log in which is super annoying it keeps telling me it cant refresh data and its soooo annoying please fix this now
"Spam & Messaging-Needs Improvement. Thankfully I recently figured out that I can pin important messages in my IG *inbox*. Lets face it, whether ambassador or not, influencer or not its more efficient to be able to organize any inbox Previously I had a lot of unread messages that were grouped w/already replied ones It was driving me bonkers For people w/biz pgs I can imagine theyd like such efficiency as well. It is beyond annoying to have to go through &amp; constantly block sex *spam* and or phishing profiles Every story I post there are accounts that are complete spam W/just a booty pic, no friends, followers or posts. IG needs to improve a spam blocker fire wall or something This goes along w/privacy &amp; security. Barely this year I made my IG public again due to having to get a restraining order on a guy. Who knows, he could be creating a fake acct as a chick just to be able to see my profile. PLZ fix this ASAP. Regarding *editing profiles* I joined the IG fam in 2017, most for biz &amp; networking connections. That being said, it would be great if there was more flexibility in creating an IG title. Besides blogger, model &amp; athlete &amp; investor. Or at least being able to have less of a cap on the word count"
"Privacy Issues/ suggestions. I want to give this five stars, but I cant because there is a problem that has not been fixed for over a year. I still cant update my account and theres no way to know if reporting a problem does anything. Also, theres nowhere in the help center that lets you know how to update your account; I tried to turn on automatic updates but theres not an option for it on my account. It works with my other account, but not my main one I guess. So frustrating. I still havent gotten reels and theres no explanation why. Sorry for the rant but Ive tried everything and just want to fix it"
"Spam... spam... MORE FREAKING SPAM. I hate using Instagram now. I only have a few friends and I checked it infrequently. Now when I do its mostly advert spam and crappy bot posts trying to sell me scam items with this suggested posts feature. I cant scroll back to see all the old posts I might have missed, seriously why did Facebook have to ruin this app?"
Not secure enough by the looks of it. Got logged out of my Instagram account today and received a message saying my account has been compromised and may be deleted if I shared my password again. Again? I never shared my personal data. Think Instagram needs to work on its error messages and hacking. Awful. 
"Account was hacked . Absolutely no customer support. Hi. I hope a creator or team member will reach out to me . My account was hacked and then they changed the email to its I have tried all of instagrams help and verification methods and nothings working . But I have not talked to an actual human. No one has tried to make things right Im on my 5th video confirmation please help me . It wouldnt matter as much other then I feel cheated, I was one of Instagrams first users, my one friend only communicates to me that way and I have pictures before my moms accident that are sentimental , memories and everything gone for now, also its fraud because the hacker is posting about bitcoin and I have never once posted about financials on Instagram or fb. You would think a company thats pro meta would realize that this is a huge issue. You also think someone could help. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
5 stars all the way. Instagram used to be just a place to go when I was bored. But now that I have an account just for fishing. It is amazing. I can navigate through my personal or my fishing account with ease
Hacked account. My personal account was taken over by a foreign woman posing to be me Many complaints to Instagram and still nothing done Yet there is precious photos of my grandchild on there that I cant get access too
"Direct Delivery of Spam. App recommendations/suggestions algorithms feel designed to only show 1. Ads/Sponsored content, 2. Spam/meme accounts that repost content stolen from other accounts"
"Instagram changed my Life. Instagram has helped tremendously with by depression and anxiety.  The accounts I follow truly bring me joy.  Other accounts teach me, release/encourage my creative side.  As far as two of my favorite things in life. FASHION and HALLOWEEN - there is ENDLESS inspiration.  My having my own account of all my favorite photos/Instagrams , I basically have what comes close to my dream job.  I liken it to having my OWN magazine  I think I have close to 4,000 pics of all my favorite things.  Animals, fashion, horror, extreme holiday decorating , vintage things.  All the best stuff.  An Im able to access it anytime I need.  Not to mention all the incredible PEOPLE I have met on Instagram.  It is BY FAR my favorite APP  I hope someone reads this so yall know how much I love  you  Also Im typing this in the car waiting for prescriptions so please excuse the awful grammar and awful blabbing"
Sooo Slow. No matter if i use it on my data or on wifi insta is so slow All videos pause and take for ever to load. I dont have any issues like this with tiktok or FB. Instagram needs to step up and fix their glitches. Obviously the app requires way too much data
Enjoy it more than Facebook. Personal opinión I enjoy it this site better than Facebook More mature even protect you more That what I feel
"Just awful at this point. This app used to be amazing. I was able to share pictures in my life with my friends and also see my friends lives. Now all I see is ads and the main button to post is gone which just proves how stupid this app has become. The only reason I keep it is because of the past, all my Old images remain. Its only a matter of time until this app goes into the garbage. They never take any feedback from their users and just as Facebook they will wither away into nothing. Very unhappy and disappointed. Everything is about money though so Im not surprised. Garbage app"
"NOT RELIABLE. Record with your phone camera, if anything. I recorded a new personal best with Instagram but the app did not post nor save my video so thats gone"
"Worst thing of you are trying to have a business and a personal page. Im unable to have a business and Personal page because Im not able to log into my business page because Instagram says you cant have two accounts on one page. WELL GUESS WHAT INSTAGRAM, IVE DONE IT BEFORE SO WHY CANT I NOW? Im trying to run a business here and a lot of people see my stuff on Instagram along with Facebook. This isnt good for having two accounts. Thats all I gotta say"
"New iPhone 12 Pro Max. New phone, and I just downloaded the Instagram app. I have tried to log in through Facebook, and the old fashioned way. Both times it has ended in an error message. I cant get in. Otherwise, Id love to give a more positive review, had I access to to its features. I do actually love the app. Please help. Thanks"
Silences Palestine voices. I have heard from multiple people on Instagram that posts made by people from Palestine are being taken down. And that people who post about Palestine do not show up in searches. Data rights groups are working towards having more transparency surrounding these issues as well as the Instagram algorithms as a whole. I hope that if enough people leave negative reviews on the App Store that Instagram will notice and change how they are running the app. Thanks for reading 
"Instagram gets worsen by each update. Recently updated Instagram and my private messages disappeared. I had some messages with stuff saved on it and its all gone now. I know I havent been blocked and the messages havent been unsent. On top of privacy invading our internet history, now its deleting our private messages as well. Good job IG, 1 star is too much"
Stay away. I post the absolute minimum. They mine your data and use it against you
Worst Support Team. After finding out that the app now live streams users when theyre using it meaning mic is on and camera is on to the head offices I just delete it every now and then. I also deactivate every now and then. Privacy is key. Stay safe
Love Instagram. But wish parental (and even personal) controls existed
"Great app, except for the algorithm limiting what is displayed and to whom. IG is a fantastic app and platform.  Great operability and tools.However, what is displayed per the algorithm is very very annoying.  Id like to see the posts of people whom I follow in chronological order, newest first, but that doesnt happen.Also I strongly suspect that display of my own posts to my followers is limited.  I am a non-commercial account, with ZERO SPONSORSHIPS, and the reason for this is puzzling.I dont mind the ads, but theres a problem there too.  For instance, I took a business trip to New Orleans last year, then was DELUGED with ads for New Orleans businesses for the next 9-12 months.  I tried disliking the ads due to relevance, but theres no algorithm there to pick up the clear data that I am ignoring all New Orleans advertising.Overall a great app, but too much going on behind the scenes that the community doesnt know about"
"Why did they make private accounts have ads?. I have always loved Instagram, I used it daily and is my most used social media app but around 3 days ago I noticed ads popping up which the never did before. I have seen ads pop up on my other accounts but that is because they werent private but my main one is. I just am really frustrated that now when I scroll I see A TON OF ADS And I am not able to pay to get rid of them. So now I am not sure if I can still use the app because there are just way too many ads now "
SO MANY ADS. Not even worth it stealing my information
"Stop censoring free Palestine. I am a longtime user of Instagram both in a personal and professional capacity. However, I have recently noticed instagrams censorship of Palestine-related posts and am strongly against the silencing of people who are under oppression. I demand justice from Instagram when it comes to the displaying of content"
"Terrible choices. Ive loved Instagram for many years for the ease of access and simplicity of the app. However, Ive never been more angered by an update from any app as much as I was for this recent round of changes. Im normally a proponent of change as I appreciate new and improved experiences but this movement of the notification button and the upload button and replacement with the reels and shopping button was outrageous and offensive. This move was a blatant ploy to increase their traffic to these features without an ounce of caring for the end users experience. Its difficult to navigate with one hand now and it gives utmost priority to features that intend to sell to me or to collect more of my data. I knew this was an issue but Instagram was shameless with this update. Ive never been this embarrassed for a company. Indefensible and disgusting"
Dont have the option to share posts/stories to my story. I have a business account on Instagram and I wanted to share a new post to my personal page to spread awareness to my company and I dont have the option to do so????Please fix this bug
"Get Your  Together IG. Account getting Hacked. dear instagram,please make changes to the app. I wish to put my account on private,but it&#39;s on business and not personal. I don&#39;t like the fact i can&#39;t put my account on private. I will like to put my account private even if it&#39;s business account. I had multiple accounts impersonating others and messaging me my account is business not personal. I know you can put a personal account on private,but i want to be able to make business account on instagram also Private. So please, make a change.Get your  Together Instagram. My account got hacked and IG is making it easier for people to hack accounts. Get your  Together and Make Changes"
instagram is the best instagram...finally. instagram has really been the app to access and use the communication tools that are instagram it is really been the best app to use instagram all my life and i am really thankful to FACEBOOK and instagram for beening the best app to use instagrams and follow and unfollow people on instagram and publishing personal media to semi to fully public audience on instagram cheers to some app that will become popular because that is not how things work
"AWFUL. This is my second review written and I cannot stress enough how terrible this app is becoming.You are not only changing algorithm, but are also changing other personal things?Rumors of Instagram being able to access our cameras, emails, messages, EVERYTHING have been floating around. (Check YouTube, December 20 TOS update)This does not make me feel safe anymore.Used to love this app and now I hate it. Awful.Ill most likely be leaving within a few days.Wish I could give you a 0 star "
"Dont install. Instagram hasnt been fun since 2019. Now theyre run by new ppl Meta and they disable your account for the STUPIDEST things. called my friend b*tch now my account of 6 years is GONE All the memories in my archive gone You cant even appeal the decision because instagram doesnt check anything or respond back Go to twitter and search instagram disabled and youll see thousands of stories like this. Made a new account and now only my business account has all the updates, but my personal account has nothing, not even the reels feature"
"Accounts disabled. I have had this app for multiple years and I was randomly disabled, I never violated any of the users guidelines. I used the app only to view posts and never commented or frequently created posts however I was disabled for no apparent reason. I had completely lost both of my accounts with all data erased and no way to recover them. Even the phone number/ email account recovery wouldnt send me an email or text me leaving me no way to get my accounts back. I cannot create another account either, I have been completely removed from Instagram for some unknown reason"
Not good. Too much ads and farms data
"4 stars. I really love the app, I could easily communicate with my friends. My smaller complaint would be that when my friends read the text that I sent it would pop up that there are two of them instead of one like normal. My biggest complaint is that recently my Instagram feed has not been refreshing its feed unless I was at home and not using data. Im not sure if thats Instagram or not but all of my other apps have been working without me being at home"
"Worst Support Team. One of my accounts just got out of shadowban after Instagram is pushing a new black creatives matter agenda probably for company quota numbers at Facebook yet my personal account still remains shadowbanned. Its been over a month now and no response from Support Team I try to message them monthly and nothing. How rude then nowwww, noooaw theyve released a botched version of TikTok how unoriginal, tragique"
"I Can Not View My Messages. I have two accounts on Instagram. One for personal use, and one for my business I run. I want to know why I am not able to access any of my messages on my business account? I have them divided into Personal and General I have even checked my message settings, as well as the other settings listed to fix this problem but nothing seems to work. Now I am missing out on business inquiries and potential client bookings because of this. I have tried reporting the issue, but I a met with no response from your team. This is very frustrating to me as user"
"Fake accounts. Ive been using and growing my Instagram for a long time now and have recently been a target for fake accounts using my photos as either hate or for their own personal game and Ive never seen customer service be as terrible as Instagram. Its came to the point where my profile is now private and Ive removed everything personal from my Instagram now and plan on never using the app again just because of how Instagram just doesnt care about hate speech, bullying, or harassment. It baffles me how an app can be so careless. Find another app that cares better than Instagram if you plan on growing your account"
"Selfie Verification Process. Ive been locked out of my personal account for days now. It all started when I tried to do this selfie face identification process and every time I put my face within the camera the app shuts off. Of course theres no one to get ahold of at Instagram. Ive deleted everything factory reset my phone, reset passwords and still NOTHING"
"Its good but. One day I was just going to update insta and after I updated it and tried to get on it it said I have to download it in the App Store but I have it so I thought about deleting it but then all my data would be gone, Also sometimes when Im posting something after I post it it doesnt even show up, so I post it again but now the first one shows up and theres two please look at this review and do something about it"
Instagram errors. I love using Instagram but for the past couple of weeks now I have tried to do story polls and questions but when I try to see the results of them it doesnt show it just shows my insights and since my account is a business account when I switched back to personal it worked but it doesnt work when I am a business account
No support when hacked. If your Instagram gets hacked Instagram has made it so confusing and impossible to get the account back. There is no lines for support when something like this happens. no email or phone number to get help
"Saving reels issue. Hello Instagram team,Regarding the Reels, I have noticed an issue with the settings and that is allowing anybody to save your Reels without letting the actual content creator to control it, for privacy and protecting someones content Intagram might need to improve this option and make it as any other platform that would allow content creators to either allow saving their Reels or doesnt allow it, we have the right to have this as an option even though our accounts are public we should have this choice to stop others from saving our content with permission. Many things in Reels needs fixing and protecting privacy is an example, same as tiktok, saving content doesnt make it someone elses content because a users username will appear as a watermark. I hope we have the same thing with Reels.  Thank you"
The best of the best. Literally the most app I use off my phone. This is where I get all the information I need ahaha
"Problems sharing my story. No matter if I update my phone, the Instagram app, my privacy settings... when I tag friends in stories they cant share them So annoying and Instagram have been no help"
Fix it. People can hack your phone using insta Why is insta letting people send links that have viruses or that can track your IP address?? Not ok. FIX THISS
shopping. get rid of it this isnt a shopping site its a social media site for pictures
New Terms of Service. The new terms of service is ridiculous We get absolutely no privacy what so ever. Contemplating on deleting the app
"Silencing and manipulating people. This app literally censors pages trying to get big,mines your data, and floods your feed with tiktok. Dont use this app"
Call to Action Missing. I have a business Instagram account and reels are a crucial part to how I can engage my audience.. however the music is disable and it says that music content isnt available for this account. Why? Why? It makes no sense that I cant use music with my reels on my business account but on my personal i can?
"Improvements list:. The app is great there are just a few problems that need to get fixed. Heres what i think of the app :- We should be able to customize the layout (the icons at the bottom of the screen and the message icon)- REMOVE the shop icon. Instagram is not a shopping app and its really annoying.- Bring back the ability of seeing other peoples likes. If people cant handle not having as many likes as someone else then they shouldnt be on Instagram.- Make the app CONSISTENT. I have a few different accounts and theyre all different. One of them doesnt have reels, the other has the shop feature, the other one doesnt even have the new messaging update.- Its very hard to grow a page because you get blocked for literally no reason. I once got blocked on my personal account because i was liking too many photos. BUT I WAS JUST SCROLLING like what app punishes you for using it too much - The help option you use when you try to contact Instagram doesnt work. I never get a response and my problem doesnt get fixed.Anyways thats all i have to say I really hope the app fixes these issues"
What do I think?. I would really like someone at Instagram to assist me in getting my business account up and running. I was hacked back in November and now have to use a personal setting for my business.Ive been in touch with Facebook so many times and no one seems to be able to helpIt impossible to reach anyone at Instagram either
bad app. steal my information
"Fix the algorithm. I used to spend so much more time on this app but lately I never see any of my friends and familys pictures anymore. Its all ads and celebrities, to the point where some people that I actually care about seeing dont even show up on my feed now. It makes time on the app feel boring, shallow, and forced"
Watch out for this app. This app steals your data and acts like it isnt a big deal but it actually is turn your location off if you use this app
"Like it, but. I do love Instagram for following photographers and other influencers.  I enjoy the aesthetics of the pictures I see on there.   It&#39;s become way too bloated and obnoxious recently, however.  Case in point:  I can&#39;t stand the hyperactive &#34;loops&#34; or whatever you call them.  Just now got startled out of my skin by some stupid video with LOUD audio  I can&#39;t stand that--minus 2 stars  Must remember to keep my phone on MUTE  I just want to view photos; I don&#39;t want the other bloat (reels, stories, videos, shopping, blah, blah, blah.) Oh, and the social-sharing nonsense?  How do I opt out??  Please simplify a bit, Instagram"
"IG on iPhone X. I downloaded a newer version of the app a couple months ago and lost my ability to share and link ANY posts to stories. This has been super frustrating for running my blog and business. It has nothing to do with privacy settings. I could do it one day, and the next day...nothing. Other than that, enjoying the features"
"Hacked Instagram. Dont have ways of actually talking to someone about the issue of hacking over the phone.  Can you guys please ask unusual phones and phone numbers to verify with picture ID BEFORE THEY HACK AND TRY TO CHANGE PASSWORD, username. Because my other connected social medias were getting hacked too.  Please help please Instagram. Just happened to me this morning and still is right now"
"Change in feed. Suddenly my feed is filled with things I dont follow and from other countries. Its become uninteresting because I dont see the content I tried to curate for myself, and now I dont even understand what they are saying. Unfortunate as I have a personal page and a professional page"
"Hackers. I keep on getting messages from other accounts on multiple accounts and they go like this,  I didnt expect this to take so long, But I finally got it all done. You better love it. I even used some of your pics. And then it brings you to a website either asking for your password, or one of those scammy iPhone giveaways or gift card things that ask for your email and stuff like that.This app is great but I am getting really upset that people just give out there passwords and I have gotten this text (and similar texts) multiple times a week.It makes me feel unsafe because if I have my personal info and maybe even a debit or credit card then the scammers could steal all of my personal information. Please get your stuff together Instagram.Thank you"
"Instagram has just killed their app. The one good feature instagram had was explore page, where you could find pictures, videos, content etc. that got your personal criteria. Now that explore page is gone, not only have they entirely killed the livelihood and personalization of their app, they had also made their app nearly obsolete replacing explore page with an almost identical copy of tiktok. If I wanted to watch tiktok, I would simply just go on the app and not on instagrams explore page. Instagrams core intentions are now entirely gone as no one can find what they enjoy on the app anymore"
"account making. every time i try to make an account on instagram, the following information comes up: We&#39;ll review your info and if we can confirm it, you&#39;ll be able to request a review in the Help Center within approximately 24 hours. why does this keep happening?? even after 24 hours that still comes up. can you please just let me into my account? :/"
"Instagram needs to realise its not TikTok. As many of these reviews seem to be sayingInstagram is going down hill. I love the artists and businesses I follow on there, unfortunately I never get to see them. Either because my feed isFull of ads or suggested posts (which Im sure was the point of the explore page) - or because accounts are being deleted for violating their terms of use for work that you could find in a gallery/museum (god forbid we admit breasts exist). This has all been slowly bugging me over the years, but now the app has decided it wants to be tik Tok and is pushing reels down your throat. I dont go on Instagram to use tiktok, I go on it to use Instagram. Own your USP and grow a spine. I didnt think I could have no respect for an app, but here I amI have barely scratched the surface of all the updates that are taking away everything that used to be good about this app - Im trying to run a business. I shall be taking my focus elsewhere (not tiktok Shocking, I know, Instagram ideas team - but Somewhere that lets me post pictures and lets people see them)"
"Why is there so much porn and no freedom of speech?. I received so many porn images and I say Im not interested what is wrong with this app. We are we all deciding on being OK by freely giving away our data and going into the META world? The source is US human beings. Life, travel love, exploring. We dont have to document everything we do. Live in the moment. Not comparing one another and hating each other for what we look like and think. Freedom of speech is very important and thats slowly being taken away"
Political voting. Do I really need to see constantly voting information.  I am a grown adult I do not need to constantly see voting info
"Digital Erasure. This app should be an incredible platform to provide exposure and share information on so many causes. Sadly that is not the case as the powers that be are consistently removing activists content, and acting to silence the exposure of war crimes and brutality. It is shameful"
"terrible updates. The series of the latest updates ruin the experience of using instagram. Search, create new post and notification buttons replaced with shopping (??? on a photo sharing app like wth) and reels (even though most of the reels Ive seen were from tiktok anyways) and put in the top corner which on larger phones is so user UNfriendly. Honestly  you should listen to your users"
"Bad. I love insta but the app is so bad, slow and uses too much data"
Hacking. My Instagram &#34;jordanray6124&#34; was hacked and I can&#39;t report it properly. Their scamming my followers for money and stealing their accounts as well
Poor customer service. There is no customer service or support to help you. Ive had a previous account hacked and stolen and no one at Instagram will respond to get that old account back. The algorithm changes are also a nightmare to keep up with and hurts engagement
"Key business features not working . I have a public business account and have two BIG problems 1. I do not have option to use music library in the new reels feature, yet for some reason on my private personal account I can. Reels are VERY important to my business and it doesnt make sense to not have this turned on for me2. Again - public business account - I have reshare to stories option turned ON but people cant share my content from my story to theirs. It makes NO SENSE as my settings are correct in my account. This is disappointing as Instagram seems to be making this unfair for accounts of the same level. Please fix these issues for me Id be more engaged and active on the platform if so"
Instagram. My original Instagram was hacked Ive very disappointed with the lack of care of personal information and how many times Ive reported that my identity was stolen
We need more privacy settings for Apple/iOS platforms. Despite my privacy settings on my personal account Im still getting unwanted messages and follow requests from weirdos so if you can and are willing to make that happen Ill give yall five stars but until then 4 stars will be your review. Oh and do everyone a favor if yall want to take an extra mile to earn a 5 star rating and leave our fan accounts alone next time I never impersonated anyone but for some reason you decided to take my fan page down without any evidence of impersonation
"Design research. Hello, Instagram has evolved into something bigger than anyone couldve ever imagine. Originally a way to share square photos with friends, it has opened up a world of influencers, networking, and huge movements. Incredible. As a design researcher I find Instagram to be very interesting"
"Used to my favorite, but. The app hasnt been working properly since Sunday, March 8.My business location wont come up when Im on that account and trying to tag the location. I have to start the post on my personal account and switch it right before posting.And notifications dont indicate which account they are for So annoying(Below is my old review)...Would&#39;ve been 5 stars if it weren&#39;t for the algorithm. I want to see things chronologically, not they way Insta &#34;thinks&#34; I should see them"
"No response. I have sent multiple emails explaining how my Instagram was hacked, email changed and I could not access it. This person who hacked my account is also sending out messages as me to get my friends to buy into what theyre selling and a few have done so believing they were giving me their personal information. TheOriginal page is still active in spite of the fraudulent activity. I have reported it and many friends have reported it and its still not deleted"
Insta. Instagram is an ok app but I got hacked  So if u are thinking of downloading insta be careful because if u get sent a link saying this took me three hours to make .  https/giftshop.buzz//(your name) dont click it u will get hacked x
"No freedom of speech here. This is the worst social media app. Full of terrorist and racist, and when you make a general comment they block you and leave those who bully and violate others privacy And when you contact them to know why you were disabled and get evidence of the violation they claim they do not answer back Why? Because they have nothing to show back, they have no evidence of  any violation. It used to be bad, but now it is monstrous Its time for change and to leave this meta decorate others"
Post privacy. I think it would be a great idea to stop certain people from seeing your actual posts. I dont want my entire family seeing my summer bikini posts. Mainly because thats kind of weird.So adding that picture to actual posts instead of just stories would be great
"Newest update reduces usability. With this newest update the apps usability significantly.  You now have to search for the share button and notifications; which their original place has been replaced by shopping and reels.  This app is not a shopping app, stop trying to shove it on us.  The new accounts management centre also limits anyone who has a personal and business/creator account from accessing both while also sharing to their Facebook pages"
"Instagram Live. Everything is good, but my Instagram like is glitching bad. Even connected to WiFi and my data"
Open Up. I think we should be allowed to also post things we write...like our personal inspirations etc etc...not only pictures and videos
New update Bad. Everything is good with browsing. Just have a problem with Instagram dms. Its like your privacy along with the other persons is no longer valued. I wont be surprised if the next feature added is the ability to see whether or not the person you are texting has left your dm or the specific post the other person is looking at. Like ??????
Hacked. Becareful someone just tried to hack me by sending me text through someone elses account I follow.  Asked me to copy the link and send it to them.  But I clicked on it and it gave me access to my Instagram.  And they wanted it.  I found out they had hacked my friend.  I tried to do a complaint through Instagram but the pre determined options didnt allow me to complain about this specific hack.  I had to just block them and hope for the best
"login and songs. the songs option to put over pictures or anything on your instagram story doesnt let me choose the part i want anymore. this began happening about a week or two ago. and also i tried to delete the app to reset the song problem and now it says cannot connect to the internet connection, please try again later. when i am connected to wifi and on my cellular data. please fix"
"Hack. Instagram isnt as safe as they try to be, someone hacked my acct and Instagram wont respond to me"
No Customer Support. Absolutely HORRIBLE My instagram account was hacked a month ago and Ive tried everything I possibly can to get in touch with the support team which seems to be NON-EXISTENT Im sure Im not the only one with login or access issues but theres no place to call or email to get in touch with any representative. Such a frustrating experience
"Instagrams help center. Instagrams help center is completely useless what if we dont have our phone number, email, our last password or our account got hacked. I recently just got my account hacked and the steps to recovering my account is useless. I know that the account belongs to me, I wish Instagram could reset it for us & just give us a code. Ugh thank you very much Instagram"
Locked out. After using my instagram regularly I was locked out due to unusual activity then the only 2 options to log back into my account I had over 7 years were my old email &amp; phone # I no longer use or have access too
"  . #_ #__#__#__#_ .                 ..  #_#_#___It&#39;s the worst app I have for my personal account but when I talk about my country Palestine, Israeli aggression and terrorism"
Confusing. Hi Instagram Im confused so when Im on Instagram trying to log in on my phone its error if Im on Wi-Fi but it on cellular data its works Im confused a lot
"Fake Account. Hello. I have reported a fake account that was using my personal profile picture, that has used the items I posted and that has now taken the meme that I used as a profile picture I posted as their profile picture. This person is asking my friends for money and is trying to extort me as well. You have yet to do anything about it. I havent even received a message regarding what I reported. Do you not care about the safety of your users? I would like someone to contact me about this as soon as possible"
This app stupid. I like it but dont every time a person either like too many pictures or unfollow somebody they block the action and now my account is acting up and I cannot like picture of follow or unfollow people and this is really irritating me and its like its no point of using this app if I cant even do anything and I feel like they should delete that action
New update 2022. Im very upset with the new update In my personal feed I should only see the people I follow but with the new update once I see like 3 post of the people I follow it then says youre all caught up with post from the past three days then it proceeds to show me suggested posts which thats what I go to my explore page for. There is no need to have suggested post on my personal feed and most of them are adds Im not interested in
"help. hello, instagram is cool and great for advertising but seriously you guys just let personal accounts be taken away with the winds. ive been locked out of my real instagram @samlawll for two months for literally no reason at all. ive emailed you a few times and have been waiting on a response after sending in my photo with a code emailed to me. it would be very cool to not be afraid to start a business platform on instagram in fear that itll be swiped off with no explanation or help"
Hacked App. This is not the app updated version of Instagram the hacker has some how cloned the app and signing in to a browser not connected to the App this Facebook and Instagram Hacking is an epidemic and no matter how you change passwords this same hacker been hacking my social media Instagram and Facebook for 5 years straight and nothing has been done with the complaints made it a win lose battale and an invasion of ones privacy you have to do better in this area
"No support whatsoever. Instagram has not gotten back to me after many attempts to get support from them. I havent been able to see any direct messages for over 3 weeks. Ive tried to delete the app, log out, access on a web version, turn my phone on and off, nothing has worked"
Instagram Hacked. Ive been an avid Instagram user and this pass week my Instagram was hacked. The person changed my number and email associated with my account. Prior to that I changed my password numerous times because I received an email saying there was a suspicious activity and someone was trying to log in my account. I reached out through the help page 5x . Tweeted them 3x. And I even dmd them all to which I got no response So that is a big concern considering I had personal information attached to my account. They are big on security but you receive no help whatsoever. Oh and the help center? Does nothing  It just redirects you to the point you get frustrated and give up . I was told Id be able to get a code and it would direct me to a restart link never happened When I commented on Instagrams photos I wasnt allowed to because of guidelines  yet we have all these spam and robot accounts. While Im genuinely trying to get my account back because the hacker is using my profile to ask people for money
Bug or idk. I dont know if its a bug or if Im doing something wrong but I have two accounts on one account it shows me the options for ad fundraiser even though its not a professional or business account it also gives me the option for personal information in the settings option but what its missing is when I hit the new Messenger icon on the top right and it says me to that second screen on the top right of the screen theres only a plus symbol instead of the camera symbol for video chat and pen and paper icon for new message when I switch accounts to my second account that account does have those features but its missing the personal information option under settings and also doesnt have the ad fundraisers feature
"Personal opinions under attack. If if not the option of the liberals, its false information. Free speech only permitted if it fits the narrative of the left"
Egads Great suffering Jesus. The amount of data (MINE) you collect is obscene. STOP IT. Just tap on data related to you for a mind boggling eye opener. This review has not been published for weeks
Bad. Instagram made it hard for you to post and a lot other and you cant like nobody pictures .or comments and someonething all ways pop up ever 2sec its a bad app at this point. (1year later)And I have good WiFi and my phone is one and its not letting me get on my page 4weeks later ever thing is fine but on my iPhone I cant make any videos or anything but on my iPad I can yall really need fix this and then yall got nerves to tell me my username is wrong yeah okay to be honest no body should use Instagram and Konw yall telling me my password is wrong YALL wrong
Hacked app. Someone has taken over my account with Instagram
"Best app. Hi Id like to say i love Instagram its so much better than Snapchat and Facebook as my Snapchat isnt letting me log in, I love how you have protected peoples privacy on there profiles if they dont follow them"
"Hacked, fake account, and harassment. 1.) My Instagram account that Ive had since 2016 was hacked. I reported it many times and absolutely nothing was done about it 2.) No my old account that was hacked I was being harassed/ sexually harassed by three boys who I do know. I had reported them several times and nothing was done about It so disgusting and sickening to know that app as big as Instagram doesnt do anything about this like this 3.) Since this app cant do anything I had to make my new account. And while scrolling through the people you may know I found a fake account using my last name and my photo. I reported it and I just got someone back from Instagram saying that the fake account pretending to be me doesnt go against guidelines Are you joking This hacker is literally pretending to be me and this app wants to say there nothing wrong with it Im pretty that so messed up Stealing my account then making a fake one, stealing my name and photo. Instagram this all needs to be fixed ASAP because this is just down right ridiculous Ive about had with this app Its becoming nothing but a trash app for nothing but fakes, hackers, bullies, and people who like to harass others"
"horrible. the new update is HORRIBLE it is so user unfriendly and just reminds everyone where the true priorities are at - not at making the users happy but with making money. NO ONE shops on instagram. no one ever WILL shop on instagram. please stop trying to shove reels and shop down our throats and just make it back to normal and BRING BACK CHRONOLOGICAL FEED. its ridiculous. i had to unfollow like 900 people just because i was only seeing strangers posts and nothing from my actual friends. ever since facebook bought instagram it has been going slowly downhill. another thing - instagram should not be monitoring the election??? i dont need to be told election results and to register to vote by a PHOTO SHARING APP. i do that on my own time and look at news for politics, not INSTAGRAM. fix it for the love of god"
Like INSTAGRAM. Love the ease of taking a pix on the go&amp; posting it. Wish there was more personal engagement- that&#39;s a human issue though. Wish I could load image from computer. Thanks for doing free speech. Amber Deann
"No help. After my account was hacked and stolen, the help from Instagram was sadly lacking No response to emails after their solutions failed which even included broken links"
"I need answers. So I love this app dont get me wrong, but I have one thing no one can help me fix nor has Instagram gotten back to na after multiple times reporting it. I can not for the life of me get the button that says Add post to your story on my account. I have deleted the app &amp;&amp; reinstalled it. I have also completely deleted any data whatsoever from my phone &amp;&amp; reinstalled it. But nothing it working. I have my bestfriends account added &amp;&amp; her account shows the share button. Why is it that mine doesnt? I need some answers please &amp;&amp; thank you"
"Fake accounts and bots ruining it. Over 40 percent of users are fake and stealing intellectual property, not a fan of that. Also not a fan of ads that somehow target me from conversations Ive had or texts and instant messages. Seems like this app is invading my privacy"
"Fake accounts and bots ruining it. Over 40 percent of users are fake and stealing intellectual property, not a fan of that.  Also not a fan of ads that somehow target me from conversations Ive had or texts and instant messages. Seems like this app is invading my privacy"
"Worst costumer service I have ever encountered. I was a victim of hacking across my social accounts over two years ago. I reported it endlessly, and since then had to create new IG and Facebook accounts, one which is a business account that I use daily. I have not violated terms in either of the new accounts, I have been through 2 new iPhones, a changed phone number and an infinity of reports to IG support with NO HELP. I did not ask to be hacked, trust me. Absolutely ridiculous that I am unable to use the app on my phone. I rely heavily on the platform for stories, reels and posts as a registered dietitian who works in private practice. Its really a shame you allow victims of social media hacking to suffer more than they already have by the violation of privacy and precious memories that have shared through social. It would be nice to get some help on this, but it looks like Ill be banned from the app forever on my iPhone"
2022 crap. I have used Instagram since the day it opened. When they first made it the security was great now. The security is crap my account was hacked 3 days ago still no contact back my kids pictures and mine in someones hands. Ive sent 30 password resets to my email and everything nothing the person changed my email and I still see mine as a secondary but it wont let me open my account. 2022 Instagram is a disappointment. You cant even contact customers service. Complete crap
No Refresh. My Instagram has stopped refreshing and the WiFi and data are both functioning well
"Boring. Harsh algorithms favour big accounts and I cant ever see my friends posts anymore. Im now going to unfollow loads of accounts. Also the advertising is wild, theres an advert every three posts. My feed just feels like SPAM as its literally adverts and random videos. My feed feels like just some random part of the Internet Ive ended up on, not my personal feed. YAWN no incentive for me to go on. Plus my business account the algorithms are too harsh too. Small business literally couldnt spend enough money to have any visibility over larger companies with big budgets. So I wont bother trying. Instagram is pro money anti user"
Amazing. I am amazed on how good Instagram is I have 4 accounts one for my famous pet and personal and other stuff like that but it is easy to switch between accounts and you always know when you have a notification on another account because the icon at the bottom has a red dot. I love this app very much because me and my Bestfriend share an account and we absolutely love using it we get to post things about us and how we cope with troubles and we find that people on Instagram find it very helpful. I also have a fan page which I find amazing because I love expressing how I feel about someone and not getting judged why or because of who I am I would definitely recommend this app to others
"Hacked and deleted. My Instagram account has been hacked and deleted and Instagram still hasnt gotten back to me, I wrote them numerous times..this is going on 5 weeks already.. Im starting to have privacy issues with Instagram"
"New update loses the function of instagram. I rarely write any review but this update and the recent one have compelled me to write it. I have been an active user of Instagram for years. I just want a portal to post my pictures and share with my loved ones and view theirs. I dont shop and wont on Instagram. If I want to shop online I would go somewhere else and not on Instagram, despite how much they try to sell to me. and the videos from Reels are absolutely annoying. Theres no way to hide or not see it. I cannot even post photos with an easy access now. It really defects the purpose of having an Instagram in the first place"
"No one wants a second TikTok. As someone who uses Instagram for both personal and business accounts Im extremely frustrated at their recent announcement that the app will be focusing heavily on video. Not everyone wants to do video Stay in your lane and do what youre good at, and why we all started using IG for in the first place"
Disappointing. My first account I made in 2010. They wiped my memories and wouldnt tell me why or what I did. Since 2020 my third Instagram has vanished and they dont allow you to talk to them. I never thought big tech giants would have this much power. How can they just BANISH people from existence? You want my data but you wont let me on? If youre in the gram dont say or post anything or they will silence you. Its unfair thats why after the third account deleted I am moving elsewhere. Screw you instagtam natzis
Instagram deleted my page. I had never had issues with Instagram before but after this Ive decided to stop using the app. My Instagram was flagged for suspicious activity even though its only my personal photos and account. So they must have logged me out but in doing so completely deleted my account that I have had since 2012. Ive tried every help center option imaginable but nothing works to retrieve my account with so much information on it. The lack of customer service or help within this platform is absolutely terrible. My account that has been established since 2012 with memories and a following is now gone forever
"So excited to delete my account. The worst in terms of privacy violations, updates that only serve to enrich the billionaire owners, censoring artists/activists/and lgbtq+ content, and overall awfulness. Do not recommend"
Easily hacked. So I got two of my instagram account hacked  They have been using my daughters picture to scam people on my account I did everything to try and delete the account or get it back. Youre security authorization codes and everything its easily accessible I even messaged instagram support told them what happened and did nothing They changed my whole information and now Ive lost two account by scammers Its going to be a month now
"What I Think Instagram should include:. On the whole, I love Instagram Im glad that you can connect with other people around the world and at the same time being able to be part of a community.On the other hand, if Instagram were to add a system in which they we able to detect nasty comments from a persons personal inbox or on their posts, then I think this would definitely help to stop haters from messaging mean comments. Im fully aware that you can reduce the amount of comments that you dont want visible, but wouldnt it be better to have this as well?Im sure if Instagram were to do this, it would benefit a lot of people, especially those who are famous and who tend to get a lot of ongoing hate towards them"
No help for hacked accounts. Security emails from Instagram dont actually allow you to deny changes they just take you to the help page.  No response in attempts to verify account.  ABSOLUTELY no help from Instagram so far and help page is a joke
Sick of the updates. Instagram please stop updating your app with annoying reels and shopping pages. Im here to see pictures not 1 minute videos TikTok and IG should be two separate things Youre ruing your app and thats why people are leaving. Listen to the users and stick to what Instagram is actually used for..photos No one is buying stuff and no one wants some stupid reel button. Wasnt IGTV enough?? Its gotten to the point where I only use it for messaging friends. Please go back to what you know because at this point Im ready to delete all my accounts and find a new photo app. Super disappointed
Horrific customer support. Someone hacked into work whole account of mine taking thousands of followers private information and after no less than 100 attempts to contact Instagram way of stopping it I gave him the daily attempts and even a basic response that was not machine generated -The way this platform is run is borderline unconscionable
"Annoying to use. I will continue to give this app 1 star until Facebook comes around to the idea that using a phone app on a tablet is WORTHLESS and annoying Further, as Facebook has locked out the functionality of the API preventing legitimate third party solutions to this problem and continues to refuse to provide an official alternative"
Love it. Likes for datas
"Doesnt feel personal anymore +2. 1. I miss the function of being able to see all of my contacts when I search for people instead of some of my contacts and a bunch of accounts IG thinks I should follow2. At least give us the option, a la Twitter, to see photos in chronological order3. Load more than 3 comments at a time"
"Meh. While the app provides utility in a handful of ways, the bombardment of advertisements has progressively eroded said utility. The user should maintain awareness that all data submitted is sold to the highest bidder"
"Get rid of ads. Just get rid of advertisements.. if I want to buy something I am going to buy it, stop using device and account data to try and make money, it might not be illegal but its disgusting, you dont need money to host pictures and vids"
Someone Hacked my @tatgods page. I need help with someone that hacked my Instagram and changed my information
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THEY WATCH YOU SCROLL. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ITS A COMPLETE SCAM  ALL THEY ARE DOING IS MANIPULATING YOU AND ACTUALLY EARNING MONEY OFF OF IT. THEY WATCH EVERYTHING YOU DO AND HAVE TOTAL CONSENT TO SEE ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFO ON YOUR PHONE (you give it them when you sign up) DISGUSTING
"Bugging out. I love instagram and i use it almost every day but recently its bugging out WAYYYY too hard. They disabled my account for breaking community guidelines (which i didnt) and then gave me access to it a 1 week later. And sometimes most recently, when I click on the app a bunch we limit the things you can do with your account messages pop up when i havent been using instagram, ive been asleep. I checked my security, changed my password, enabled two-factor ID so ik my account isnt hacked but the amount of issues keep piling up"
Going downhill. Suddenly Im getting notifications that people I follow are posting content and I cant disable it. I do not subscribe to their profiles in that way and none of my notification settings imply that I will receive alerts in that regard. I also dislike how there is no grid view. When can we put an end to the endless scrolling of large pictures that take up the whole screen? This is why we get repetitive stress injuries so easily
????. Why does the app prevent Palestinians from downloading media to spread information about the attacks towards them??? Just curious????
Account Deactivated for No Reason. Instagram does not care if you have a poor experience. Your download and attention is all that matters to them. My account was hacked and then deactivated and I had no way of contacting support. The help center is useless and they will never respond to your form submissions
"Entrepreneur. IG is a awesome platform for everyone in various aspect of endeavors however there are many many times when IG drowns small business. At times we dont have funds to spend on publishing Ads, and my page still isnt seen as much as it should. They should work or programming the BOT better to give small business a chance to shine.IG also has the most cliche security system I know a personal person thats still unable to access there account after changing there phone Please work on these concerns as I feel Im being honest and I contributed to the survey. Why do the system give you your original page not the latest. Especially if you had more than one account"
"Stop supporting Zuckerbergs pedophilia dungeons . Instagram sells your personal data, photos &amp; videos to pedophiles to boost their stock price so that Zuckerberg can buy more islands with more and bigger cages to lock more young children in sex dungeons."
Locked out of Instagram for the second time . 1st time then they wanted a selfie video on the app. I gave a selfie video on the app but then I later got locked out again for no reason and told to give info to the app again and I dont use the app so I dont see any reason to give info AGAIN after I already gave a selfie video . maybe the lock out happens when you user a different browser such as safari or google instead of the one you usually use ..dont know
"Frustrating. I have two Instagram accounts, one personal and one for my business. I cant have both connected to Facebook, however.  I have to keep switching it around to post of either my personal account or my business account and share it to my Facebook. Its a total pain"
"Not able to share videos or pictures to my story. Im annoyed that my Instagram is the only one that cant post other pictures or video from different accounts to my story and yes Ive checked to see if the accounts were private or not , when ever I click on the forward button that looks like an arrow , it does not give me the option that says post to story. Ive deleted the app tried updating it and nothing works"
"Hacked. My Instagram was completely hacked and I wasn&#39;t able to retrieve my account after 10 years of having the same account. I had the security features turned on l, however when attempting to gain access back it would give me an error message"
"Bots and fake accounts are out of control. Its a great product, but it seems fairly obvious that Facebook isnt interested in a great user experience due to incredible amount of fake accounts, false information being peddled, and scams present on the app"
"Great for my business but. I use it for work as a tattoo artist, and its great at that, but my main complaint is about the private messaging system. It is just not well structured. I would like if when you get a private message there would be a bubble similar to Facebooks Bubble so I can receive messages instantly without missing them. I think its ridiculous that I need to open the app to check, and often accept people before they chat with me. Not helpful. I understand as a social app (not for business) that may be nice, but at least give us the option in settings to set message pop ups if we want them and to disable parental-like accept controls. Also the whole primary vs. general inboxes is annoying, there should also be an option to be able to make your own custom named folders. As of now, I just find it to be another thing to need to check and would rather have one inbox instead. Another thing that could be added would be an option to change which account you wish to post something to, right before posting it. I have my business account as well as a personal account, and far too many times I go through editing a photo or several just right to get to the comment section and notice I have to cancel it and go back to switch accounts on the main page because I was on the wrong account. Not cool. Overall, the app is decent, there are still minor photo editing draft save bug errors in cropping pictures, and a lack of size reformatted iPad 12.9 app interface, just the small phone app with everything made bigger together. These things are easy to fix, and I enjoy using the app most of the time. Thanks"
Feedback. I love this app .Its really good for communication with friend and safe privacy
"Steals and Restricts. Steals data and ads are based on what youve searched for on a web browser, wont let you delete an account if you dont know the password, there are way too many ads, Jesus Im starting to hate this thing"
"Unnecessary Non User friendly changes. Every account you use, personal, business, finsta, etc etc will have different options and layouts and settings. Making it terribly inconvenient. App updates are often changes that will mess up your work flow and alter your experience with the app"
"Forced birthday information. Im sick of apps trying to gain access to my personal information. Forcing me to add my birthday is unacceptable. Make parents bear the burden of proving their children are of age to use IG instead of making everyone else give up their personal information. Delete my account, IG. I rarely use your garbage platform anyway"
"Update doesnt allow for sharing posts in stories. I hate this new update I love to share posts in my stories but now I cant. Im not sure whats worse screenshotting the post, cutting it, and tagging the person or literally sharing the post so people can go directly to their page. Why would you do this Instagram?? And not even tell users theres a way to edit this privacy setting so they can fix it??"
"New update. The new update its terrible  I only get to see about 10 post from my friends then comes a bunch of random pages that Instagram is suggesting . Its annoying and the new algorithm is worst . I have 2 different accounts , a personal and a weight loss and both make it harder to keep up with . If you dont make reels then you pretty much disappear . I hope they bring the old Instagram back"
Won't let me save pictures. It says it has no access to any of my photos but has all the access to everything else. I use my Instagram for my business and for personal. I would like to know a reason why there's a glitch still even with the update
"Creepy child of Facebook. Why is Instagram so creepy? Spying on us all, defending fascists in the us and Middle East but censoring teenagers?"
Watches people. I had to delete the app cuz someone was taking pictures of me through my phone I know about how they watch you aswell and so Im always worried when being near my phone
This Instagram discovery. Still learning and new to Instagram in more ways than one. My old account was hacked so I closed it down as followers where being removed by hackers. I get stalked by the programmer I refused to marry and these girls obsessed with being influencers. Its easier to use than I thought. Still trying trying to figure out what to do with this account. Fun when you do meet cool people with great ideas who support small business. I host workshops and sell hand crafted couture
"Annoying notifications. send random notifications to try to lure me to log into the app. Aaa, bbb, ccc recently added to their stories and follow Xyc, abc and others you might know on Instagram I DO NOT CARE STOP SENDING ME NOTIFICATIONS And the only way out of this is to disable ALL notifications for this app in your settings. If I could give 0 I wouldAldo it REQUIRES a phone number so they can sell your data"
"This is the future. This is the future. The dystopian future. The one where companies like Facebook and twitter gather data on people, partner with 23 &amp; Me, and clone better versions of us to replace us. Brand the number one into your cheek before youre replaced. But three stars because at least this version of dystopia is fun"
Spam profiles tagging me. I hava a private profile. How can fake spam profile tag me in their photos every day. I spend more time reporting users then liking photos
New UI is garbage. Shopping and reels. Thats exactly what I use Instagram for. Not looking at pictures or anything... there is literally no point in moving the notifications and post buttons other than trying to get people to click on shopping and reels by accident
"Cant deactivate. No human customer service. Instagram doesnt let users reset their passwords in order to prevent deactivations. No available customer service, just pure data mining. Absolute trash "
Hacked. I was hacked by ray ban imposters a few months ago Instagram has locked my account and they will not help me retrieve it. They are not keeping track of their business due to COVID-19 Instagram is ignoring all of the gore on there platform which they claim is sustainable for 12 year olds. FIX UR PLATFORM
"Locked out of account for no reason, literally zero service. Instagram disabled my personal account that I have had for over 7 years, with absolutely no warning. Any troubleshooting attempts just led me around in circles with error messages at ever turn. Asked to confirm with phone number - error message. Login on desktop - error message. Login through Facebook - try again later. No response to customer service emails. Absolutely brutal"
"I cannot use instagram over a VPN. If you are over a VPN to preserve your privacy Instagram doesnt allow you to use the platform...hope is a bug...otherwise, really creepy app to be sincere"
Can no longer select photos from library. Used to be that each time I made a post I could manage what photos Instagram could access. That seems to be gone now. Guess Im no longer posting since I refuse to give Facebook unfettered access to my personal photos
"Issues. Im having an issue with my account, where you put your name it has my boyfriends name an it is not letting me change it. When I try to change it it takes me to Facebook and when I tap on personal information settings it shows his birthday and when I try to change it it takes me to Facebook n its shows my birthday and I tap on save and it still shows as his birthday"
"Instagram useless. Hi I got hacked and I am completely unable to delete my account. Theres an information breach of my account and Instagram is so useless. I tried to delete the account and was only able to temporarily delete it for a week. I also tried to call Instagram and talk to a human and they have no customer support besides a completely useless FAQ website. I also tried to call customer support for Facebook and they have none, their extension to FB law enforcement is not in service its ridiculous. Get this fixed Instagram. Make things straightforward"
"N.R.Hart - World Poetess. I am World Poetess N.R.Hart. My business profile account of 5 years was hacked into May 1, 2020. The hackers are impersonating me,  they have stolen my poetry of 5 years and deleting it. My 80k followers are looking for me  I have submitted many requests for support and help reports during this time to Instagram &amp; Facebook for them to recover my account. No response They have done nothing to help me recover my account. The hackers have control of my account at this time. Their help and support functions in place are not working They are not accountable to their community. They are not protecting their own community against identity theft and hackers. Your information is not secure with them. I am extremely disappointed in Instagram and their staff. N.R.Hart"
Subjective. Deleting publications related to global issues according to personal interests
no help. i got my instagram hacked and someone is still on it and i tried to get instagram to help and nothing. the account is in my name and has pictures of my face but instagram won't let me access it. and i can't get the account deleted. all i want is to talk to someone to fix this rather than consulting a help page that doesn't actually help anyone
Unneeded updated & greediness. As someone who used instagram for personal & business use this app has become one of the biggest headaches. It seems like everytime i log in there is a new & useless update that makes using the app  a pain. I currently wanted to upload a video on my timeline & it wont let me post it as a square. It keeps stretching out my videos and ruining them. This is beyond annoying as i spend time or hire people to edit content for Instagram which no longer works because of some useless update. Facebook as ruined instagram. I pray a mew social media platform like the old instagram is created because im exhausted with all the crap that this app brings to my life. Listen to all the reviews instagram has. Everyone is sick & tired of this foolery. Bring back the features we actually want and stop making things complicated for everyone.   I went from having instagram be my favourite to wishing that the app burns down that might say a lot about how much yall messed up this app
"Awesome Aesthetics. I am very grateful and happy with the updates and flow of Instagram. In a time where we are all disconnected from being able to share company with one another- this app enables it&#39;s users to see their friends, family, and strangers allowing for a stronger sense of community. Visual and audio components create a stronger impact than text. While the stories feature encourages daily data entries - the feature for reels grows a users following"
"Gone Downhill. Update: the latest update is HORRIBLE They moved the notifications button from bottom to too and replaced the bottom button with a shopping bag. Money hungry and extremely annoying after visiting notifications on the bottom for years. Using this app less and less as time goes by.Original review: I remember when IG was fun. Now, they are riddled with porn bots and trolls and when you report people who violate the terms, 9 times out of 10 they write back saying the account or post didnt violate the terms, though it clearly did.To top it off, I decided to make a new account for a specific subject and after about an hour of using it, following 45 people or so and making maybe 20 comments, my account was deactivated. They made me send a photo of myself holding a picture of a code and Im waiting to hear back, but this is honestly ridiculous. I didnt violate the terms at all, unless commenting and following people is a violation of their terms, rather than the whole point of Instagram.Tl;dr They let alllll kinds of stuff (bullying, porn, hate speech, etc.) slide but if you comment too many times (?) from a new account you can get deactivated"
Slow. Instagram want load with WiFi or data that&#39;s a bad thing I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happening lots of glitches going on.
"Verified Blue Badge. Im currently on Instagram. I would like to let the owners of instagram know that its embarrassing how many peoples accounts and profiles are being hacked and there are scammers from other countries who are using other peoples profiles for scamming and I think its unfair that Instagram only gives the blue badge to people who are famous or who are popular. I believe that for Instagram must take action and first of all  give the men in the military, marines and navy a green verified badge to protect them from having their profiles stolen by scammers . And for other individual accounts who wish to be verified with a badge as well because its not fair that this situation continues to happen and the more this happens the more people that will close their instagram accounts and Instagram will cease to exist without us individuals. Also, there are many fake accounts on Instagram. I believe that Instagram should verify peoples identities or if its a business to verify the business is legit. In retrospective, Instagram is soon going to all their users if they continue to give priority to those who are famous or popular in order to get a badge. Thus, Instagram will lose its popularity just as MySpace.Sent from my iPhone"
"Help center isnt helping. I love Instagram but currently my profile isnt working. Wont let change my profile picture, bio, privacy, authentication steps, and wont show my likes in the activity tab just suggestions of people. Im very frustrated as I cant get a hold of Instagram and keep making reports and nothing is happening. I just would like some help in getting these problems fix. Ive tried all the suggested information on how to fix problems and none of it is working"
Facebook ruined Instagram. The tittle alone speaks. The new update is horrible. I dont see any of my friends post.. like my main page is just the explore page Sometimes I go onto the app and immediately close it. If I didnt see the new recent pictures when I had the app open the first time. I wont see em a second time. I absolutely hate it. Also when I go to suggested post when Im done looking at my friends post. The suggested bar just stays in the middle of the app blocking all of the other post. Facebook taking over the app just ruined it. I deleted Facebook years ago. Instagram selling to the was a a big mistake. I absolutely hate it. Maybe its time to delete my Instagram as well
"No support at all. I made a business account through a link in my personal account. They required a phone number and I provided my magic jack number without any verification. NOW they locked my account temporarily thinking I was a victim of phishing (I wasn\'t) and are asking to send me a verification code to the number on the account, SURPRISE I cannot receive texts from Instagram to that number and when I finally reached support to tell them about my issue they dismissed me and told me to go back to the help center which is uselessss Shame on you I worked so hard on my account and now I don\'t know if I will ever get it back, even though I can if someone just lifts a finger and gives me a call on my number instead of a text and I will adjust my contact information after I get access. Instagram you can do better"
"No Support. My Instagram account has been messed up where I cant comment, follow, post captions, and some other things for over 8mos. I have a business ig and personal. Both are affected. I have been reaching out and reporting issues no response no fix. I dont know what else to do but I would really like my IG back to normal. Im not even sure why this happened in the first place"
They hacked my Instagram account. Ive tried to contact the Instagram support and gave them any evidence they asked of me but they couldnt help me get my Instagram back.Someone hacked my account and changed the login info and password.And they are using my pictures to lie to people..Please I need your help.Ive had the account for 5 years please I need it back
Instagram got hacked. Hello Please can you help me my Instagram has been hacked. I have so much personal information on there I really need someone to help me please
". I had Instagram for over 10 years. I was hacked recently and my account was disabled to then being able to regain my account TO THEN again unable to access it, but on Instagrams terms not the hackers. I am upset &amp; well angry at Instagram for not allowing me to continue using the app to regain my account or potentially make a new one because they have compromised it. I cant access my old account or start a new one through the app or other internet options. I am at a complete loss. I am upset about losing my account, all my beloved memories, people &amp; places in my life that only lives though the app, that I no longer have. I am angry at Instagram for not getting back to me when I had access, when I sent through inquiries to be helped. I am angry at how we are unable to seek help about anything in regards to Instagram through Instagram if you arent currently a Instagram user. What are those people suppose to do that have been put in my position or similar?. Who am I even talking to &amp; will I receive a reply here? I do not want to be done with this app as I want my account back and do not want a new account. I do not want to be done with this app but as I said I am at a complete loss and am done with the app if I receive no response, help in regards to my issue"
"Account hacked. Had my account hacked and instagrams help web page gave me a way to get it back, when I got to the part where they have to verify Im not a bot by making a face video to get my face at different angles and the app stopped working. It didnt register my face and nothing happened. I had my account for almost a decade And instagram will not help you out. Skip this App"
"It finally happened. Instagram has done a 180 turn straight into the toilet. I follow people to see posts I want to see. Now yall have random people all over everyones instagrams so we arent seeing the people we follow anymore. Done with it, moving personal accounts and business accounts all to twitter. I just simply cant enjoy Instagram/seeing the people I follow anymore. All I see is a bunch of ugly mfs looking for attention. Literally yall are advertising (sponsoring) peoples personal accounts. Which is fine till its not a tag or account I follow. I recommend to all to delete it before they get weirder like fb"
Review. I like Instagram. Its better then FB. I dont like that you use the data that you accumulate to sell out all your users tho. Kinda evil when you think about it. I just hope that whoever has the real control has peoples best interest at hart and not just their bank accounts interest. Hows that for a review lol
Instagram. Need to add a feature to know who follows you and who doesnt. If I go use another app to unfollow my unfollowers I get blocked out my account. This is not ok because I should be able to keep track of that
"The good app. Instagram over the years has been incredible. I went behind my moms back and created an account back in 2012. I had to get to my account on certain days but it was worth it. Eventually she found my account changed my name and but left my password. I deleted my account after many years of having it and decided to recently get it again. Im doing something new so bare with me is the best caption that I can come up with for the years yet to come. No seriously, bare with me. Youll love it. New or old get the app. Share your life. Experience something new and amazing and have fun. Dont compete or compare, youll hate it. Enjoy who you are and what you have to offer and let them be amazed by you. Enjoy and be safe"
Its fun. Great for business and also my personal page reach more people with this app then their other product
"New update issues. I hate how Instagram has scrapped the whole explore page and replaced it with reels, like they are turning into TikTok I used to like to go on my explore page and look at pictures and find new people, and they even used to have reels on there too, so I had a choice whether or not I wanted to watch reels or look at other peoples recommended posts. But now I only have the option of watching reels, so now I cant even find new people to follow. Which I thought was the whole point of Instagram, was to explore and find new people, and I get you can do that through reels, but those are just TikTok videos, and I would like to see peoples posts and memes. So I would like Instagram to go back to what they had before, an explore page with posts and reels. As I think this is the better option as it includes both videos and pictures, not just videos"
"I dont have reels on my phone. I tried everything I deleted the app , I erased all my data , I updated my phone , I updated the app , I temporarily disabled my account and turned it on I did everything you can possibly think of and I even wrote Instagram in the help center and dm section and they never replied . Im trying to be a content creator but I cant cause I dont have the latest update on my phone can someone or Instagram help me ?"
"Very poor customer service support. I have been using Instagram for the last 7 years and it has been my favorite social media platform. Unfortunately my Facebook was hacked back in February of 2018, and so was my Instagram account because they were linked. I lost over 1000 photos and had my privacy violated by the hacker. I was able to create a new account, but I am still unable to use the app. The website is very limited in terms of functionality. Despite numerous reports and messages after the accounts were hacked, no one contacted me on how to proceed with my new account. On top of my privacy getting violated, I was also banned from the app with no support from the company. Update 2020: Between two new IG accounts after being hacked, one personal and one business and between TWO iPhones, I still cant access the IG app through my iPhone with either account after endless attempts of trying new passwords, deleting the app and downloading again, changing network settings etc. I find it hard to believe its an iPhone issue since this has been going on with two phones. For some reason I can get into my iPad though. "
"Fascist App that becomes unusable with each update. Terrible layout and interface. Every single update makes using the app less intuitive and adds features that exploit the users like Instagram shopping and increasingly pervasive advertisements that they subtly increase every update and which are highly personalized based on the data they steal from your phone. I clicked a free trial ad and Instagram had already pre-filled my name, number, and email address on the companys formI once donated to a gofundme through instagrams web browser and was promptly defrauded on the credit card I used for hundreds of dollars.Fact checkers are comically inaccurate and used to censor political opinions. Instagram will take down accounts that go against its political preferences but allows nudity and sexual posts.They added stories to compete with Snapchat and lately also added reels to compete with tiktok which Instagram incessantly pushes. Just scrolling down your story they auto play reels and you dont have the choice not to see them. Meant to shorten your attention span and keep you glued to your phone addicted to brief dopamine rushes. Evil app"
Instalover. Me encanta Instagram .. es más personal

"The world of Technology. Well. you can actually chat with people around the world with this incredible app just like Messenger, Facebook and Twitter. you can download videos or pictures that you have ever recorded for everyone to see"
"due to hacker and instagram deleted my account. I got hacked 5 days ago, they changed the email and i didnt even get a security email approval on my email of the change  I requested a link via my phone as the user name they also changed.  The link would show there user name id.  The email to confirm my account, another way to try to get in was how i knew they hacked all my details but my phone number, apparently.  After reporting my account was only disabled 24 hours later and due to violations.  Of course this must have been due to the hacker. Yet i still am chasing and appealingly for my account of 10 yrs And pictures of me. I sent all the requested identification and also the proof of the links showing a different user name and **** out email which is not mine to confirm.  How is it ok that I am penalised like this Tomorrow will be the 6th day.  Its absolutely terrible given never once has my account been deleted, warned or disabled as i am a peaceful person.  I think its also disgusting that the hacker had the ability to change my user name, email, password on insta and i didnt even get an email from instagram asking if its me who is requesting the change Apparently this is the process instagram claim to follow.  Quite frankly my data rights and privacy of my pictures and account have been infringed and so has my security with the failure of notification.  Yet i am in this situation of instagram doing this"
"Love instagram, always have. Last week my Instagram got hacked. They removed my email &amp;changed the password, so I no longer have access. I have submitted forms via help.instagram, no response. Still enjoy instagram, &amp; have since created a new account. I just wish there was better communication for helping issues like mine or at least a phone number where a human could answer"
"Compromising issues. Please tell me why my Instagram every time I open it says its compromised because I apparently did something wrong, I havent bought any followers ever, and now I cant get back on that account and use it as my conversations have gone/wont load, and it wont let me send messages. Plus every time I open the app again it says I have to do the whole confirm and change password thing, which then logs me into an account that I had 2 years ago, got logged out of, and now dont really want. If anyone else has had this problem please help me out because Im considering just deleting the app and all the memories Ive made on that app. I also want to know if this also means my accounts been hacked because I might have sent personal info on that app and Im scared for my safety and privacy"
Notifications. I have an iPhone and I dont get any notifications of when people message me or even when people like my pictures. I looked in my Notification Center and instagram isnt even on there and I go into the settings and all the notifications are on. I just got a new phone today and still no notifications. My boyfriend also has an iPhone and has the same issue
"Long Time User. Ive had instagram since the spring of 2013. Over the years, the app has made drastic changes in updates. I really enjoy the overall platform and the explore page, under the search tab, to discover posts under my interest.My personal friend group for whatever reason uses instagram as our platform for our group chat. Weve been doing this for about two years now. The direct message system is sooo glitchy. Most of the time no ones profile pictures are visible and instead its a grey circle. Another issue is sending messages. It doesnt matter if I have a great or awful connection, instagram will find a way to not send my messages for up to hours"
Yessir. Unethical moderation and data collecting
Use to Be. So I like the app preferably to Facebook in general then they came out with &#34;Messenger&#34; which is similar look and maybe other stuff anyway I like &amp; use them both now barely the actual app but cause of &#34;Instagram&#34; taking a gig of data from my &#34;iPod touch 7th Gen&#34; well so I barely had room for more stuff sorry but that &amp; the taking off themes with chat is annoying to me &amp; makes me want to switch back to Android with an SD card already made as well as not constant updates that&#39;s also a buzz kill. Hopefully on Android it&#39;s a better experience 
"My account is hacked and the help page runs you in circles. My account was hacked this morning, they changed all my personal info (which makes it impossible for me to use a phone number or an email to log back in) I thought it would be easy to get it back, my friends assured me they have several processes for this. Unfortunately I have poured over the help page over and over again, and I have come to the conclusion that the app is broken, when I click on need more help button, like the page tells me to so that I can fill out a manual form to request that they lock out the hacker, it just takes me right back to the info page that tells me to follow the exact instructions that I just did. For the most popular app on the market you would think I could get in touch with someone ANYONE, but no one is to be found, I cant even get an automated message saying that my message has been received. This app gives this person access to so much of my personal info let alone my family and friends, that its pretty ridiculous that I cant get in touch with anyone to help me. I dont know if this is a bug or a glitch but I need help and Instagram is no where to be found"
I cant even snap at people trolling me I lost 5 years worth of photos on Instagram. Instagrams algorithm got angry because I snap at white nationalist proud boys all kinds of racist trolls making insane comments of my mixed race children ok I shouldnt say anything I get it but some of these comments where directed at my family I feel the need to at least snap and block you cant have a a reaction I guess on here now only to promote my photo work I wish Instagram would give back my personal property especially of my children
"Yall need to stop fr. yall are taking peoples info/data, watching people and now taking people to court? in my age of Aquarius? yeah. Issa no from me. 1 bar"
Instagram isnt working. Instgram isnt working in my iphone like its downloaded on my phone and i get nofications but i cant use the app
Instagram please fix. Instagram calls havent been working properly I can never hear anything or my app freezes and its not the phone or WiFi because Ive tried with data to call and this is a brand new phone
PROBLEM. With this new update Instagram has logged me out and when I did the steps to get back in my account it still says  sorry there was a problem with your request  Ive even went so far as to emailing Facebook I did their steps and still cant get back in and i know my account isnt hacked because It still has all my information and it still pop up on explorer page
"NEVER AGAIN. This is my 3rd making a Instagram account and this same message keep popping up  We'll review your info and if we can confirmit, you'll be able to access your accountwithin approximately 24 hours, and I dont even be doing anything. Im so tired of it. They need to fix this issue immediately"
Account Recovery Issue/Hacked Account. I have had Instagram since 2013. I have never had an issue until recently. My account was hacked about 2 weeks ago. I went to the help center and the directions were confusing on how to report that I have been hacked.  I have tried emailing and had friends report my page because they are getting messages from my account and clearly it is not me asking for passwords/ phone numbers from the Facebook and Instagram accounts. I am unable to get in since the hackers changed my email and password. Is there anyway I can help in resolving this issue and recovering my account
"Issue w insights. I havent been able to see my followers insights since Oct. 12th idk if this is something I have to wait for an update to fix or what, but Id love to be able to see those Im finally starting to grow a little and Id love to keep track of it Thx"
Add it please. Please add a Face ID or Touch ID to your app. It would be perfect Im pretty sure a lot of people would love this feature for privacy
"so many issues. i love instagram but what is going on? i have a private account, i do not post, and am very cautious about what i comment. i do not spam and my account follows all guidelines. i randomly received a strike saying your post doesnt follow guidelines which i figured out is an actual strike on my account. im confused because this makes no sense given the nature of my account. also auto scroll continues to plague my feed. i tried to turn it off. same with notifications. turned it off on my phones notification settings as well as on the instagram app itself. yet i still receive countless notifications. its almost like the app turns on all the settings i disabled. can someone please advise?"
"No internet connection error. Hye. I do have a good internet connection mobile sim data package and even wifi. 50,60% my instagram app show my no internet connection error please share how to rectify this problem  PS ( data is allowed to use from data usage)"
Instagram is getting worse by the second. AFTER FACEBOOK BOUGHT INSTAGRAM it got worse. Its already bad when the ads was popping up everywhere then the layouts changed. Problems Ive ran through was refresh feed timeout and getting too many likes or following/unfollowing too fast leads to account being suspended. Using packets to limit the data sent and received is bad enough.. Third party apps are useless now as the api is limited. What happened to the number of likes? Its just two users name now... how do u know how much likes you got?
"A reason for change. Good fundamental concept, however algorithms of the users are getting out of hand and should not track our data in the methods that they employ"
"Seeking Instagram Support - Flaw in their security code. I have been using Instagram for 10 years and am a huge fan of the application. I was logged out of my account for suspicious activity (which was a result of me logging on from my computer). In order to access my account, I had to verify a security code to my email. I have access to my email and am not receiving a security code. In the help center, it instructed me to check my spam folder, verify the email address, check with my domain provider, wait a couple hours for the server and log on via Facebook (I did not connect my Facebook due to privacy concerns with the Cambridge Analytica scandal). I checked all these methods numerous and nothing was wrong on my end . My presumption is that Instagram blocked my email account for some reason.  I reached out to Instagram which I presumed would get back to me because they are an established company, however, have yet to receive a response. I am very upset that I am unable to access my account of 10 years due to a flaw on Instagrams part. I have built my personal and professional  network and my social network will suffer. I hope that Instagram rectified the situation and I am able to fix this"
Make a version for the iPad. Facebook is content with having one of the worst UX in all of digital design. You think by harvesting hundreds of billions of dollars in illegal data they would be able to pay their design team more. I guess the Zucc is content trying to buy Hawaiian land away from the natives instead. :)
"its a great app but i NEED help. it wont let me open the instagram app, ive tried resetting my phone, logging in on my safari browser, offloading the data for insta, and even deleting and reinstalling the app i dont know what to do"
"Add to Instagram . Opinión- Make a new option in settings where you can adjust who sees your followers, custom wise you can pick who can personally see whos following you or who you are following. Another thing hiding your post from others but not archive them so that everyone else cant see them. This is a way of not really blocking someone completely just having a little more privacy"
Never got back into my temporarily locked account. My account got temporarily locked because someone hacked my account and I proved to Instagram I was the owner of the account multiple times and reached out multiple times through email and nothing was done. There are personal pictures on that account that I cant even get to now because you have done nothing to help me regain access. Not having a human to answer the phones makes it especially difficult because I do not believe you understand my problem
Not working. Instagram wont connect to any source of internet. Cellular data or WiFi will not work to make Instagram load I deleted it and reinstalled it and still nothing
"Two problems. Ive always loved Instagrams concern over the privacy of people, but Ive begun to notice two problems in that field:The first one being that whenever theres an update, and theres added features to the app, the option usually stays ON until the person notices it and turns it OFF, which is disheartening if the person notices it a bit too late. Take the show activity status for example.The second one is the about this account feature. Just like the problem I mentioned above, this should stay OFF unless the person chooses otherwise. The bigger problem is that this doesnt even have the option for us to choose whether to turn it ON or OFF. Some people mightve started their account when they were young, and having people see their former usernames (picked by their young selves) is simply embarrassing. I hope some change will be made regarding this issue. Id also like to thank you for all of your hard work. Instagram has always been one of my favorite platforms since I was young"
Horrible. Im not able to contact anyone to fix my problem on Instagram. Ive been having the same problems for MONTHS. Instagram wont allow me to change & update my bio or change my privacy settings or my profile picture
Help needed. Ive had no problem with instagram I honestly love this app Ever since Ive downloaded it on my new phone I stopped getting notifications. I checked on Instagram settings &amp; normal settings. Ive tried almost everything to even contacting Instagram themselves. Overall its a great app I just have a personal problem with it
"Disabled accounts. Im a small time entrepreneur and fashion designer, all my pages have been disabled and Instagram went as far as disabling my personal page, this is so frustrating and I dont know how Instagram expects me to conduct business or do anything when they keep disabling my accounts, I have so much information stored on my Instagram and they just unkindly took my personal Instagram down, this is disheartening honestly"
Photo access. Why does this app need access to all of my photos if I only want to post one photo? I gave access to a folder but it refuses to work unless it has all of my photos
Wont let me like or follow but commenting is fine??. Instagram wont let me like or follow anyone which likely means they suspected me of spam despite NOT being a spam account but yet they let me commenting which is how spam spreads anyway. No logic at all. I get spam comments constantly and they didnt do anything about that but somehow Im suspicious on my personal account
"Wont let me log in. I recently created an account I was going to use for my small business, but it wont let me log in. I havent been able to access it at all not even when I first created it. Every time that I log in it states that instagram will review my information and it will take approximately 24 hrs. Its been more than 3 days and I still cant access it. Now, I cant even move pass the log in page. I cant even access the help center or report a problem because I would need access to my account to do so. I am very disappointed at this service"
"Fix app. So my biggest con about Instagram is that when youre logged into the app and it shuts down on you, it will not let you log into another account Its so stupid Also another huge con is that unless you have access to the email or phone number on file. Youre screwed with getting back on the accountZ they should make it to were you have security questions to answer and find other ways to verify your account. Even a trusted friends account to verify you They make it sooo hard to get back into your accountTHEY ALSO DONT HAVE ANY WAY TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR HELPWhich is utterly retarted. NOT a fan of Instagram"
"No way to recover my account. The Reports+ app hacked my Instagram account. The email address, phone number, and user name was changed. I contacted Instagram help, and the only information I got was to do password resets which I obviously cant do if the resets are being sent to an email address thats not mine. When typing in my username, its no longer recognized because it changed. I cant send for a phone related recovery because my phone number was removed.I have browsed around Instagram support for over eight hours, and theres no additional support that will allow me to contact Instagram to prove I am an authentic person to recover my original username. My whole account is deleted and 10 years of NBA and NFL dancer memories are gone.Its almost as if Instagram refuses to listen to you. Browsing through existing articles should not be the limitation of the support because obviously my problem still exist and none of your support is helping from an article. I am trying to show you that hackers got to me and I cant even send an email or call an 800 number to explain my problem"
"What happened to this app. I used to absolutely love this app but now it feels like we are being manipulated and privacy constantly invaded, as well as listened to The ads seem to be non stop, and feed controlled.Plus mic is turned off yet sponsored posts are very personally focused. Wish there was a competitor with integrity and security. Its such a shame"
Bad. Instagram made it hard for you to post and a lot other and you cant like nobody pictures .or comments and someonething all ways pop up ever 2sec its a bad app at this point. (1year later)And I have good WiFi and my phone is one and its not letting me get on my page 4weeks later ever thing is fine but on my iPhone I cant make any videos or anything but on my iPad I can yall really need fix this and then yall got nerves to tell me my username is wrong yeah okay to be honest no body should use Instagram and Know yall telling me my password is wrong YALL wrong
"Ive been out since October 2019. I looove Instagram. Is one of my favorite apps and I always use it. I use it for personal things only and I have not violated any guidelines. Unfortunately since October 2019 every time I try to log in it says error. I have tried everything, emailing support, entering via facebook, with my number, everything My account works in every other device I have but not in my phone. I dont know what else to do :(?"
"Linking Instagram and Facebook. Ive been trying to share our podcast trailer that I made and posted to Facebook.  Everything online says that it should be able to cross post, but Im not seeing it at all, and of course I cant post the trailer from my computer where the trailer is saved.  Then when I go to link accounts, it wont let me link it to our podcast page, it just wants me to link to my personal Facebook.  Its been driving me insane"
"Horrible experience from customer service. My account was hacked on January 23, 2021 I have had this account since 2013 no problems at all I received a Dm opened it it stated I had 24 hours before they close my page so I reported it to Instagram no feed response whats so ever I looked up to see if there was another way to contact customer mmm lets just say you cant speak with anyone you can email all day I sent them screen shots of the someone contacting me from my own page requesting I send them money and guess still no reply so I created a new page to see if my page still up still up they changed my BIO all my pictures still up but cant do nothing about any other Instagram hit up on a daily saying you violated policy now you need them no were to be find smh my original page was c.h.i.n.o_strong I want my page back"
"Some functions not working. Very frustrating that i am unable to support my friends brands due the fact that I am unable to share posts on my story. It works for my photography profile however not for my personal. This is very frustrating, and has been an issue for months now"
Hacked account. Someone hacked my account to the point them deleted my email and took the entire account. There is no sipport no one helping instagram is poor how can they allow this to happen and no one be helping me my identity has been stolen and no one is there for aupport to fix the issue this is horrible and instagram shouldnt be allowing anyone to use there app if this can happen
Bug report. This app doesnt even recognize you read the message. Lack of privacy anything you post is subject to Mark Zuckerberg making a profit off your post and images.This is still happening Mark Zuckerberg its 2/26/2021
"Hacker Friendly. Instagram has let a hacker take my account, steal my identity, photos, and friends. A friend started posting a couple of pictures about Fortex trading, when I private messages them to say it was cool they told me that I should get with their mentor, and that it was really safe. After a couple of days they private messaged me saying my mentor wants to give $500 to all of my followers and asked me to change my email address in my personal settings. Not realizing that they were trying to hack me I did as they asked. After a couple of minutes I was logged out of my account and could not get back in. They were very pushy and what they were asking. Both my friend and I had private accounts. This happened December 7, 2021 and Ive been trying to get my account back ever since.After they took my account they then extended the exact same hack to my followers, and I can not even warn them. I made a report to Instagram and they are not doing anything about it, and I cant contact Instagram to get help. Update: I finally got my account back. Instagram did recognize me as the original user of the account. I do not think that it shouldve gotten this far though. I shouldve been able to get my account back almost immediately and been able to report it to Instagram"
"disappointing & frustrating. Instagram has lost its value for me. We all know the annoying fact that they&#39;re more ads than posts and that you don&#39;t see the posts from the people you want due to their AI trying to tell me what I want to see (like it knows more on the topic than I). Now I can&#39;t even chose what I want to post because it won&#39;t even allow me to select the images I want, it just shows me one album with no other selections to choose. All this money they&#39;re making from our data and they can&#39;t even get a working app delivered"
"Terrible management. One of my favorite accounts kept getting brigaded by extremists, and Instagram would leave the extremist comments but ban users for responding harshly to them. I was banned for quoting one of the extremists who put his personal information in his title, and was falsely accused of doxxing him. The rules are supposed to protect users, not the extremists brigading them. The system defends the people it should be removing"
"Personal info. Suggest when registration you lie, fabricate, because they sell your info to anyone that pays them"
wont let me on the app. when i click on the app to access it it wont let me in it it forces close and doesnt even let me access it. i want to respond to dms but when i go on the instagram website and use it that was it says my login information is wrong. i just want to be able to get into the app
"Nonexistent tech support. I have been trying to revive one of my Instagram accounts for months I have over 100 photos and a ton of followers and I cant access the account. Its oh my dog so I know its follows their community guidelines or whatever. I cant talk my account got hacked or what. Every time I go to the account the screen pops up and down and I cant tap on anything Ive tried emailing Instagram, Ive tried reporting problems, Ive tried troubleshooting Nothing works And they still havent gotten back to me. Whats going on here Instagram? Can you please help? Very frustrating"
Cover your cameras. I dont believe for one second that we were not being spied on before these new terms and conditions came in to affect today its just now they blatantly tell us they are to our face. Cover your cameras
"Down bad. App used to be great and fun. Ive had since I was in 8th grade, Im a senior in college now. All it is now is a bunch of advertisements I see everyday 12 times, I dont see any of my friends posts because of the algorithm, and the new updated privacy policy is super invasive. IG needs to fix its business model before we all get bored and leave this app"
Meh. Too many adds. Too many posts by people I dont follow. Not enough privacy
"Add yours. So Ive been waiting patiently and I still dont have the add yours sticker, Ive updated my Instagram app as well as my phone itself. Ive logged out and logged back in. Ive also deleted the app and downloaded it again multiple Times. I still dont have access to it can someone help? I also cant tap on it when someone posted it"
updates. I have two accounts my personal and my private but only my private gets all the updates it's really a bother since I use my personal much more
"Caring is Resharing (Stories). My friends have been unable to reshare my stories to their stories, even when appropriately tagged or mentioned, for 6+ months. The whole point of Instagram is sharing Super annoying and everyone asks daily why they do not have a sharing option anymore. One day it did not work after I changed my profile from public to private. I have updated the app, cleared my cache, triple checked my privacy settings, troubleshooted online and reported the issue to Instagram. No hope and no fun"
Invasion of privacy. Beware there are people who have porn webcam site and will include you into a site without permission and there is nothing you can do. Profile hacking is normal. You can report infractions but management will not do a thing. Out of control
Having some problems. I love Instagram But lately it hasnt let me post groups of photos. It keeps telling me that itll post when theres a better connection but it never does. Doesnt matter if Im on good wifi or data it still says it. Then I have to delete the whole post and I lose all my work Its getting really frustrating. Please please please fix this. Thank you
"Control freaks. Not only will they censor anything that goes against their political agenda but they also make in incredibly hard to delete an account, change information and constantly spam you with notifications and will not really let you get rid of them"
Some small improvements. I like the creative content that others post on this platform which is why I prefer it from any other social media form. I do have some dislikes/suggestions that could be fixed. When posting a story (or sharing a post to your story that you are tagged in) it becomes really tedious when you add a GIF or wording and the objects get lost continuously behind the post. Maybe this could be fixed. Other than this it is great. I like that you cannot see likes or what you have liked so it provides less anxiety and promotes privacy. Really great and positive improvement
Privacy=0. Uhhhh. This app needs some help. We have no privacy pft
Over 18 but cannot select allow all content. Personal information shows Im 34 but I have no allow option under sensitive content. I didnt want this feature in the first place.  Searched online for answers but found nothing 
"Refuses to show certain accounts posts on my feed. Instagrams algorithm has always been controversial.  I remember when they first came out with it, and people were pretty universally unhappy, and wanted chronologically organized timelines.  Over time, we grew more accustomed to the algorithm, but recently Ive begun to notice something.  There are some accounts that I follow, and have followed for years, that dont come up on my feed AT ALL.  These accounts are active every single day, and yet I forgot that I even followed them at one point.  Today, I got a message on my home page saying Im all caught up and that Ive seen all new posts from the past 3 days.  And yet Ill go and search for these profiles, and find a post from that day that was never shown on my feed.  Instagram needs to fix this bug (it might not even be a bug, it might be some version of their data control), and give us at least the option to have posts shown in chronological order"
Its meh. Im not trying to have Zuckerberg steal my info
"Hackers are in my husbands account. My husbands Instagram account has been completely hacked. Theres someone pretending to be my husband thats messaging our friends and followers asking for their phone number. This is a true crime. My husband has spent hours on the phone with you guys and you wont do anything about it. As artists, we have come to rely on Instagram for business and I hope you help to protect this business. My husbands name is Steve Mumford"
"Update. During the last update, I wasnt able to see my personal profile. When I click the bottom right module, the screen turns black and the only way I can get back into Instagram is to kill the app and start it over. I havent been on my personal feed in more than a week or so. It may be the fact that I have a iPhone 11, I heard they were experiencing problems. Overall Ive used instagram for a long time and its a good social app. I just hope this problem isnt eternal"
Too much invasion of privacy. Get out of my messages
My Instagram has been hacked and I need help. I have been contacting Instagram about my stolen profile and have received no help
"Too lazy to write an iPad version. Disappointing that a company as large as facebook can&#39;t write an app for iPad.  All ipad version is, is a blown up version of the iPhone app, which makes the photos, the whole point of ig, look like crap. But I guess I can&#39;t be surprised, their product isn&#39;t the app, its the user. Can&#39;t wait for apple to disable their ability to profit off my data. Maybe then they&#39;ll have to step up their game and write an actual app"
"This was the best app at one point, is now easily the worst. This is a copy and paste of Facebook with bigger pictures. Since they made their partnership with them (sold out to them) this has been the worst app Ive ever used on my phone. The single worst feature ever added to an app is that when you scroll down your FOLLOWING feed (main feed) after you see all the new posts it automatically brings you into suggested posts. That is literally the worst feature of all time. I am not scrolling through the for you page, Im scrolling through MY FOLLOWING PAGE. I WANT TO SEE POSTS FROM THE PEOPLE I FOLLOW. And how you gonna take away likes? Im the only one I know that cant see likes, whats the point of doing it to some accounts and not all? Why am I being penalized by not being able to see like count, a very basic feature? Listen, if youre young and looking for an app to get started on THIS. IS. NOT. THE. APP. No cap go to Snapchat twitter tik tok even FACEBOOK for gods sake. Ill be deleting my Instagram and never going back on. Take care you god awful app, hope your coding goes wrong and the app fails like no other app has ever failed before"
"Went Downhill FAST. Instagram used to be soooo good Now, its a joke They just randomly got rid of a ton of the filters. They completely changed their layout so that you can only find shops, but trying to find the upload or search buttons is ridiculously difficult. Now, my notifications are full of erroneous branded content notifications that have no info included. Why on earth are they making these terrible changes?? No wonder everyone is leaving Instagram for Snapchat and TikTok. What a shame that theyve fallen so far"
"the problem with instagram. I have lost multiple accounts due to hacking, disabling, and apparently not following community guidelines. Like so what I like, comment, post, edit profile, follow, and unfollow too often it doesnt mean you have the right to deactivate a account. I had amazing memories on my first account, especially text conversations. I even got followed by famous ppl. I think I have had about 4 personal profiles, 3 private profiles, 1 meme page, and 2 fight pages. They have all been deactivated. I think it is horrible. I&#39;ve been active on Insta since 2017 but my current account has only been active for about 5 weeks. FREE THE MEME PAGES "
"Easy. Easy to upload pictures. You can have multiple accounts linked to Rachel other. So you can have a personal account and then one for pictures of your cat, weight loss journey, or whatever"
"Get rid of the bots. Mk. I love insta and all, but there are SO MANY BOTS on popular meme pages and celebrity pages, and most of the bots are inappropriate. I do NOT want to see a woman wearing revealing clothing while scrolling through the flex tape man&#39;s comments. Also, can you stop restricting people from liking posts? It says I was temporarily blocked from doing a certain action. All I did was like the post. Isn&#39;t that the point of instagram??? I didn&#39;t even do anything or comment anything wrong And lastly, my friend @notesbysophiaa was hacked by someone and once they went into her account, they started following random indian people or some people from south asia?????? BOTS We had her email and we weren&#39;t able to sign back in/recover it bc it says we kept being logged out. GET RID OF THE BOTS You know, as a multimillion dollar company, you&#39;d think that&#39;s one of the top priorities... but of course not. It&#39;d probably be copying other apps to be better than them and make more money."
"Update. New update is horrible and this data collection is crap. When Zuck bought IG he ruined it, and has only made it worse with algorithms and the inability to connect. So now we cant even trust the app, because its being used for propaganda and to spy on us all"
Locked out of account. I got a notification to verify phone number on my Instagram account. Once I did a page saying with review &amp; verify my info and I can request help with 24 but its been 5 days same message on page and I still cant access my page that I have had for years No way to contact to find out why
"Horrible security. Your security is horrible. It took me weeks to get the confidence to open a new account after your horrible security allowed a hacker to take over my account despite my multiple attempts to report it and you still allowed it to happen, allowed the hackers to take over my account and they ultimately deleted it after taking it over for 3 days. They had plenty of time to keep my photos and videos and who know what they are capable of doing with my photos and videos. I lost all my valuable photos and videos. Valuable to me because they hold sentimental value and they are lost forever. I really hope you do better. Four of my friends accounts were hacked during the same week. You must improve your security measures for everyones safety. It was a horrible experience and a violation of my privacy and I hope to never go through it again"
"Sharing posts to stories. I used to be able to share posts (my own and other peoples) to my story and one day, this feature was removed for no reason. I cannot even share my own posts from my feed to my story. I do not even have the option to turn this on or off in my privacy settings. I have reached out to Instagram for help three times and included screenshots and have gotten zero response. Awful customer service"
"Current version issue. No matter if im connected to wifi or data, the app will not update the feed or load any photos, except the messages (excluding the photos)"
"why is this now an  in app purchase ?. For personal reasons I deleted my app not knowing of the change and when I went to reinstall it, I couldnt because I have to purchase it. What if someone so much as just wanted to restart the app? or deleted all social media to start fresh and come back to find out they gotta pay to have it back? What if someone purposely deleted it off of someones phone behind their back and now that person cant get it back because they are not old enough to buy it? I dont understand why this cant be free like how it originally was. Its a great app yes, but it would be by far the best social media app ever if teens or unpaid adults could use it. You already know that if it was free more and more people would join it so why change and make it purchasable knowing not much people can afford or are of the age to buy it? Please reconsider what u are doing right now"
Ads. I download ONE game I saw in an ad on Instagram and now every fifth post is some stupid ad for a stupid game. I have personalized ads turned off so theyre still collecting my data and bombarding me with something I clicked on ONCE
No help on hacked acct. I have reached out to instagram for help recovering a hacked acct.  a strange was able to access my info without my knowledge.  The steps instagram has to recover MY account are useless  They have not helped whatsoever
"New update??. Instagram just updated the app to include a shopping feature as its own entire tab where activity used to be. Instagram you already make money off of our data stop trying to push products on me too. I was fine with it being mixed in on the explore page, but an entire tab dedicated just to advertise to us is extremely annoying"
"Buggy updates and no customer support. Bugs in the update My business account all of the sudden cannot share or repost anything to my story. It was working fine until a week ago. I know its not my account cuz I still can share things on my personal private account. I searched the internet and people say its a bug with the iOS version. Since then I have contacted customer support three times and no response from them. If Instagram feels so confident that they no longer need live customer support to fix any issues they have, they should make sure that their updates dont cause any issues. Not being able to repost and share to on my business account is frustrating. Many people had to hire a  hacker to help them solve the issue, which I dont see why they need to if Instagram is more responsive with their support requests"
Hacked. I didnt have much hope my account could get recovered but after the help of my bf and the steps to follow for Instagram I was able to. I would suggest that they get a better account recovery system of customer services workers that can answer the phone because the hackers can operate to fast for the authentication needed to recover ones account
"Hate the new update so much. Having the activity tab disappear was not a great decision Having a business page on Instagram I love that page as I can see exactly whos liked my pictures and whos followed me... but now thats completely gone, I guess Ill have to get used to it but that was the first thing I tapped on when I went to Instagram business or personal account"
Account Problems. Instagram is great. Im just really sad that you cant contact Instagram to help with your account.I need help with mine. Ive tried submitting request forms and searching around the Help Page and nothing. I really want my account.I know my email and password but it wants me to verify a phone number I lo se access to. Sorry if this is too personal to post. I just feel really desperate and this is seriously stressing me out mentally
HACKER. Ive been hacked once or twice and im afraid that it will happen again. People always text me my address AND my phone number ON INSAGRAM and i never give that personal information out to anybody. Please deal with this instagram
Why cant we upload from computers?. Im starting to use this app and I have projects on my computer. But I cant upload my pictures from my computer onto Instagram directly and have to try to find some other way to do it? Why? Why bother having a desktop version if you cant upload pictures directly on there? What is the point? Im seriously confused about this decision and am thinking of deleting the app because I have no use for it now because I cant get projects from my computer onto my phone. Fix this please
Cannot refresh feed or connect to Internet. I need help to fix this problem. Ive had it for quite sometime and doesnt work on my wifi at home. Same goes with Facebook. Ive contacted Apple and followed their steps and still doesnt work so my final attempt is to come here and ask for help. I run my business at home through Instagram and have been using up all of my data and paying more  $$$ just to use Instagram. PLEASE HELP
Someone hacked into my account. And Instagram isnt doing anything about it
"Stolen account. Someone stole my original Instagram account and is still using it They  Changed my  email, password, phone etc. I have no access to it. I spent months trying to get help from someone on Instagram. None came. Very disappointing theres no support system"
This new app update is absolutely horrible. I use Instagram to see my friends posts...I dont give a shot about seeing suggested other content in my feed. My feed is personal and it was already annoying with occasional ads thrown in there. I would literally pay to get rid of this new suggested posts. There is already an explore tab for this kind of stuff. By far the absolute dumbest update and I really hope they reverse it 
"Poor customer service. My account was hacked, I took the proper steps and I have all the prior account contact information and most of the information hackers information. The hackers are now trying to scam people out of money. I reported everything to Instagram but they were no help. Im loosing 10+ years of photos. Some of which I do not have saved in another location"
Garbage. Screw the algorythm and false COVID info floating around everywhere. Disgusting deceptive company. No privacy and forces to submit your phone number one way or another to use the app and fakes \strange activity\ to grab it if you don\'t provide it immediately. They also release frequent \updates\ but never say what they are. Can\'t wait until this phases out
"Awful. Its impossible for an artist to get even slightly popular especially recently. Blocking hashtags was incredible cowardly and overall just destructive for all people- There is no report option for things like ableism etc and you cant provide proper reasoning as to why youre reporting someone. Overall, this is an awful excuse for an app and clearly you just want to create a new facebook. Grow up and stop being cowardly"
"It tracks conversations we had sitting at home. So I was at my friends place and we talked about 2 food items , I never searched about those 2 food items and never talked on phone about it too . 5 mins after my conversation I saw an ad of the same 2 food items . Then I un-installed the app and checked after a week and none of the discussion I had at home appeared in apps , that proves it . Doesnt mean I will stop using through browser , but it just freaked me out"
"Explore in my feed. Why are posts from accounts I dont follow showing up in my personal feed? My feed is for accounts I follow, theres a reason explore is separate"
"Fight back Suggested post cr@p. Until Instagram LISTEN to their users, fight back and mark every suggested postas SPAM - that should keep them busy ..no chronological feed... this app is cr@p .. Zucherberg takes over and ruins another, previously good forum"
"Why?. I dont understand why you need to drag my connections on LinkedIn to Instagram. The only explanation I can think of is your app doesnt respect privacy  Also, why was I given a threat for account suspension when I said Biden was a hypocrite?"
"Locked out for no reason and cant get back in. I posted to my story and six hours later, Instagram said I needed to contact support to regain access to my account. I did nothing to violate community guidelines or anything. I have no idea why I was locked out of my account, its a personal account, and the link they sent me to fix it didnt work. I cant get in contact with anyone now. No one is responding to me. This is absolutely ridiculous and I am furious. This company and this app is a joke. For all I know my account was hacked, but I have no clue since NO ONE WILL RESPOND TO ME. This is completely unacceptable"
Account Hacked. My main account was hacked and I have not heard from anyone on Instagrams end to help. I have followed all of suggestions online and still nothing. The individual who hacked my account completely locked me out of it and is spamming my friends and family. It is an invasion of privacy. The fact that I have not received any support from Instagram is baffling
"SPAM. Their are too many spam messages going to over 1200 followers each day. I am not direct messsaging 1300 people a day so their is no way it is me, their is no way anyone else has my password or anything . My page is solely for me and my own purposes. Not for advertising nor for spam messages. It is harassing me and my followers . Please fix it before a lot of people resort to a different social media app. During this pandemic their should only be positivity and these messages that are sending to my people are not funny and it isnt making sense as to why someone is doing anything to their pictures WHEN NOONE IS EVEN WORRIED ABOUT THEM FIX IT NOW PLEASE AND THANK YOU . I changed my password and made a new Instagram. But whats stupid is my followers are not believing I did make a new one to get ride of this now HACKED ACCT. fix all the bugs and spams THANKS PLEASE#BLM  #ALM -06/2020 -Tica"
"Fun Sponge. I came to Instagram late, introduced to the house accounts community by a very talented and deserving influencer colleague and loved the idea of a house renovation/decor community that wasnt as personal as something like Facebook, a place to share efforts I made to improve our home lots of like minded people, who I didnt personally know. But it has becomes personal, because now what you post isnt about what you post, but its subject to the algorithm that Instagram have put in place and have taken the fun all out of it. Unless you post at certain times, all the time, and like and comment on the right things then your audience is so limited that followers that you work hard to get and appreciate are lost, because your posts are hidden to most unless you comply. Instagram, not all of us want to be influencers with thousands of followers; I just wanted to learn and appreciate others peoples pride in their homes. I fear to post now to be honest... fun sponge "
"Instagram. Have had the app for many years now, unfortunately I am starting to see more and more accounts getting compromised and hackers posting spam on them. Would love for IG to fix this whole account hacking issue"
Its just not it. I have been using Instagram for years. A few months ago my account was hacked and I never received an email notifying me that someone else had accessed my account. I followed up with emails to their customer service representatives. Ive sent soooooo many emails and reports to them and I still have not heard ANYTHING FROM THEM. Growing my account all over again has been extremely difficult with all of these new updates. It seems more like a diluted and social  version of Ali express. I wholeheartedly believe they only care about the bigger accounts. Even the update that barely shows you who you actually follow on your tl instead of explorer page posts that are now combined with the posts of the people who you follow. Honestly Instagram has disappointed me time and time again
"No Instagram reels after a year. After a year of reels being on Instagram I still dont have reels on my business Instagram acc. I have reels on my personal account, but for some reason I cant get it on my other acc. Its very frustrating when reels is the main thing that Instagram is pushing an you cant even benefit from it"
Wrongly Disabled Account - No Customer Service. After 10 years of sharing photos with friends and family using this app- my account was disabled by the Instagram team and is seemingly unrecoverable as the email associated with the account has been changed. As a family and colleague-friendly account it was not due to inappropriate content and my best guess is I was hacked but I have been unable to get ahold of anyone for over a month now. Having such poor customer service (none) for an app that stores such personal and dear information is unacceptable. 1 star because I cant give 0.Quinnbri
"Instagram is ignoring me Please HELP. I have been a user since the beginning of this platform and I love this app. HOWEVER, I have been having some bug issues and I have put in like 10 service request over a year and the issues have still not been fixed. I have 2 accounts business and personal and on one of my accounts all features have been updated and I can use the new story updates. But in my personal account I still cant post others post to stories. Or use certain sort features. Pleas respond to this or one of my SEVERAL troubleshooting submissions.  I have updated my devices, updated the app, deleted and reinstalled the app several times and still nothing. Please Help"
My passwords were stolen from Instagram. My passwords were stolen from an Instagram hack. I have had to delete all of Facebooks products and change up accounts
bad content allowed. My experience with this app has just been mainly negative sometimes I would make a few friends and gain some followers but the privacy on this app and guidelines are all messed up. Pornography and child delinquent behavior is all over the place on this app. Yeah granted they will sometimes censor a photo but that is obviously still very much wrong and inappropriate. Basically this app allows child pornography to be uploaded. Truly a disgusting app. I urge you all to keep your kids away from social media and report anything suspicious. Sick world
Instagram . Hey I have been on instagram for years now it is an amazing app everyone download no viruses On the app not thing you can add to storys and you can add posts instagram is the best app ever thanks guys bye 
Instagram wont let me access my account. My account kaysannis is connected to my old facebook and I have no other way to recover it as I lost my old phone and all my passwords were backed up on there... now Ive spent about 3 months trying to regain access. Facebook says my Instagram is connected but then when I log in using Facebook it takes me to a completely different account? Please help
Corporate Spyware. It accesses your camera anytime you touch your phone or there is sound detected. Any sound at all. So unless you live in a vacuum or take the cameras out of your phone it is going to spy on you
RD. Useless Aap All Product By Facebook Worthless Facebook deleted my Account In 2020 I lost my family Photos and Videos After this I dont like Facebook and All there products either Instagram or whats App. They didnt provide me A backup and they did took lots Of money from my credit card during boost Of some posts but still I lost my data So I hate Facebook. If Copy right or any thing belongs to Facebook page then why they deleted users personal account. I hope we get more new Aap similar to TikTok I Support TikTok And All my friends and family know about it
Take out the hacker. This app is a great app but my friends have been getting hacked frime someone that sends messages saying dont get mad I changed ur profile picture of u can take him out of Instagram that would be great
"New update. . . I use Instagram the most followed by Facebook. I enjoy the app overall, however, I dislike the new positioning of the notifications and button for adding new posts. Theyre now at the top of the screen and its far lets ergonomic. I prefer those features to be near the bottom because theyre easier to access with my thumb and when using my phone one-handed. I really hope insta will consider moving the notifications back to the bottom of the screen and putting the reels towards the top"
Shir algorithms. Funny how this app alway manages to find the posts of my stalkers . Cheers thanks for the data
"Getting Worse for Creators PLUS GLITCHES. The growing and changing algorithm Im sure is great for large corporations that want our behavioral tracking data but is abysmal for any artist or small businesses that is trying to actually reach their audience. Regardless, the functionality of the app has only gotten worse as Instagram has prioritized shopping and reels over posts the back bone of Instagram. I regularly have issues with messages, using the create function in Stories and most recently, cant make carousel posts"
"2 things. i spend a lot of time on this app but two things have been really bugging me lately. the first thing is that business and professional account dont have access to all the music they used to. in stories, only personal/private accounts can share whatever music they want but for creator/business accounts they are limited to the songs that instagram gave you. the second thing is that my wishlist will not load. it has been days and when i click on my wishlist it says were sorry but something went wrong please try again. i offloaded the app and reinstalled it but it still wont load"
"Almost unusable these days. I get that these are 1st world problems and in the grand scheme of things not at all important, but Ive been having a ton of issues with instagram as of late.First of all, text stickers arent showing up in my stories unless I save the post (kind of like a draft), post the version where the stickers are missing, delete it, then post the version I have saved (the draft).  Next, Instagram has been crashing frequently to the point where I had to delete the app and then re-install.  It still crashes sometimes.I use IG for both personal and business accounts. Its annoying enough for my personal account to not work, but when Im trying to get my business out there to the public and most of my websites traffic and my customers are finding me through IG it is more than a little annoying that the app is so glitchy"
"Overall great, besides this. So I run a meme account on Instagram. But heres the thing, when I want to see views and likes on other accounts it only says only the owner of this post can see views and likes, Ive tried fixing privacy settings and everything even going on Chrome versions and it still doesnt work. Thats the only account that does this and its my main account. Can anyone help me out with this?"
"Delete the app. I had to delete the app bc they can track our IPS number and see what we google along with face tack us and film us even though were out of the app and closed it, they can also see every single picture in our camera roll. I dont agree with what theyre doing but if youre ok with it thats on you but Im out"
"No reels no help. I have two Instagram accounts, one personal and one for my business, yet only my personal account has the update. Ive requested help to apply reels onto my business account but no help given from Instagram. #gutted"
"Posts for Close Friends. I love the Close Friends option for stories, but Id love it if I were able to share a post that was hidden to those not on my Close Friends list. I think this would be super convenient for people with a large following/lots of fans, who still want to keep more private posts to themselves and their real-life friends. It also saves them from making a private account and a business account, which can be quite annoying. For example, I dont want to be a fully private account because I need as must coverage and followers I can get, but I also dont want my fans to know about my more personal posts (family birthdays, outings with friends, favourite restaurants, etc)"
"Account center. I have two Instagram pages. Personal and animal rescue related. My personal Facebook manages/admins a fb page for the said rescue. Personal fb account used to be connected to personal Instagram account, fb rescue one to Instagram rescue. However now these accounts cant be linked, why? I can link either Instagram to my personal Facebook, but it does not give me the option to connect directly to the fb page. And only one can be connected at a time. If Im on theRescue Instagram, I can go further and select rescue fb, and it will connect with it, but then I cant connect my personal Instagram to personal fb. I dont want to have to keep disconnecting and connecting the accounts every single time I want to post, please fix this"
Full of ads and now full of reels and shopping. I get an ad after every 3 posts. Its gotten progressively worse and I just uninstalled the app. It never used to be this bad. I dont care about reels or shopping and dont need it in my face on the UI. Its become less personal and more about Instagram making money. Thanks for nothing Facebook
About privacy. Now my page is private but some people can see my likes nd views on post thats very disappointed please change it so if do nobody can see post like views please
"Cant post to instastory. Since the update, I no longer have the option to repost my picture to my instatories nor any other accounts posts(that arent private). It is only giving me the option to send it in a DM.HELP"
A Waste of Time. Dont waste your time. They steal your data
"worst platform. the censorship of palestinians voices and bias toward israel will no longer be tolerated. Their support of israels genocide and ethnic cleansing of palestinians is clear for all of us to see, and i will not stand for it. i have stopped actively using instagram years ago because of its numerous controversies like the ones related to users privacy. and if instagrams targeting of palestinians is not new, but it has been escalating and its gone on long enough. censoring palestinians posts, disabling their accounts and pages, and sharing their information to israeli intelligence are just some examples of what instagram is doing to these people. instagram claims to support freedom of speech are false if they do not allow palestinians to share their struggles under the israeli occupation. their stance is not neutral, it is on the side of the oppressor. as long as that is the case, i continue not using the platform and encouraging everyone to do the same"
"Wont allow me to share stories. I have a private Instagram account with a Close Friends list that I update on my daily life vs. spamming my entire list of followers. I can no longer share any posts, public or sponsored, to either my regular or close friends stories.Ive logged in/out, deleted and reinstalled, logged in from different devices, contacted Instagram directly through their Help section, toggled on/off privacy settings. NOTHING has worked.Im convinced its a glitch and I want my account fixed badly. Im 39 weeks pregnant and my family/friends want updates on labor/delivery/baby and I cant do that nearly as effectively via text as I could with just sharing a post to all of them.Very annoying"
"Music Access Changes. UPDATE: A majority of us have now gotten a message that our music access has be purposefully removed. We are all very confused because as creators a majority of us are not using the music for any kind of profit. It limits us as CREATORS rather than BUSINESSES to use music to express ourselves in any way. I find it unacceptable that we barely get a response after 20+ hours. If I happen to see any large creators still have access to this type of content (licenses music), then Im going to take my social media elsewhere. Something so small can drive many people away. Why do this now? Weve had access to this for a long time as creators. I get if it were business accounts using it for profit. But creators? Even when we switch to personal accounts this option has been completely removed. Its still very inconvenient for the fact that we cannot see our insights if we switch to personal, which is very important to creators. PREVIOUS:A lot of people that I know of on Reddit are complaining that theres something wrong happening with the music. Were getting random and obscure artists offered to us and when we try to search up artist names, nothing shows up.I would understand if it was because I am in another region but, no, Im from California. I used it yesterday and everything worked fine, but today, its all completely changed"
Hey facebook you greedy is showing. Literally replaced notification area with a shopping section. Who tf shops on Instagram. Swap this shop area where you currently put the notification thing
"Personal Opinion. Please Fix. The Instagram app is great and personally one of my favorites. But I cant seem to understand how you guys can block me from unfollowing all the people that dont even follow me back. Not only did I get blocked from unfollowing people, I also got blocked from liking others posts. Why?.. I feel like this is a problem that needs to be fixed because its my account its like I dont even control what goes on. If its a problem let the people I unfollow complain and then take those measures but other than that why block me from cleaning my own account"
this app should have more privacy especially for teens. like tf this app be making people feel bad about them self and wanting to kill them self like it doesnt have a lot of privacy a lot of people be exposing people and stuff
I love it. Ive been using Instagram for the past 4 years and I have 3 fan pages and a personal and private Instagram page and I honestly love it it is the best I mainly use it for posting edits but it has never failed me it is my favourite social media platform and I recommend it to everyone
"Story Settings. I sometimes take pictures with their camera and save them to edit them and post them later on , but I DONT KNOW WHY it automatically posts WITHOUT my permission , or sometimes it even posts twice with the original picture/video and my edited one , you guys need to fix this , i dont find out until later on that the video or picture got posted and look stupid that i posted things twice or unintentionally . If you guys dont fix this i will sue you as this is my privacy and you guys are not respecting it"
Censor. Use to love but now they invade privacy and censor everything
"Horrible Customer Support. After multiple attempts to regain access to my personal account which I had deactivated myself, it has been impossible to reach support for help. I went through Facebook support and was contacted by Instagram support to reply with a picture of myself and my information and a code written on a piece of paper to confirm I was the person on the account. I have received no resolution or reply since. I no longer have access to the # I signed up with, but I have all the information including pictures for my account and I have two-factor authentication with Duo Mobile. When I enter the code from duo, the Instagram app gives me an error. This is horrible service and unacceptable considering all the ways of authentication we have"
"Still Hacked. Been trying to get my Instagram back from being hacked. Sent the info you asked for. How long does it take to get it restored.  Shouldn&#39;t be this hard. Says sends code to my e mail, but I never receive it. Sent my picture with the instructions from you.  Still nothing"
Sharing fun. I love taking pictures so Instagram has become my personal share space. It also keeps me in touch with those closest to me. I try to tell a story sometimes in pictures and sometimes with words and Instagram never fails me. It is always quick and easy. I wish I could share more than 10 but its telling me dont overdo it
Instagram is getting worse by the day. Posts are being hidden. Hashtags dont work. How can followers engage? What is even the point anymore???  Its just becoming a personal photo album. Feels worse than MySpace
"Customer support for Instagram is virtually nonexistent. I got locked out of my account because I broke my old device and when I went to go log into the new device it said I needed to use a authentication app that I only had access to on my other phone in order to get in. When I expressed this through Instagram support they said that they took two factor authentication off of my account and that I should be able to get in, I tried again and got the same message about the authentication app. I tried calling emailing back and emailing other emails I found online to no avail. This is the second time Ive lost access to an account that Instagram support claims to have made accessible to me again, but this time its much more disappointing because this is my personal main account that Ive had for years and now no longer have access to my favorite photos :("
FIX THIS RIGHT NOW. me myself has never been this mad with Instagram . I am so mad  and just so done . Im. Pretty much BANNED from following anything  And liking anything It says action blocked for nothing  This is not fair at all and Instagram needs to get their fricking act together I will keep writing very mad and well worded emails this is very annoying and rude that the app is worked like this . PLUS THEY  need to stop giving notifications for everything stop using so much data is very annoying I just deleted the app because the way its acting  VERY ANNOYING IM SO MAD THIS  probably one if the worst apps tbh and until they fix this Im not downloading Im about to write a crazy mad email . DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APPS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ITS STUPID AND SLOW AND ANNOYING AND YOU WILL WISH YIU NEVER DOWNLOADED IT
"I noticed the past few days. What I noticed on Instagram across all devices (iPod touch, android and tablets) is that its slow when looking through and filtering the followers list. I noticed it on my iPod touch first then checked my s9 then my Tab A 8.0. Its obviously on your end since its acting up across multiple devices bothWiFi and data. Might be something to look at"
Please fix this before I just not use Instagram anymore. This app is super frustrating Half the time it wont work. It says Im not connected to the internet every time I try and use it. I am both connected to my WiFi and I have data on my phone. This is the only app this happens too
Love insta but. I love Instagram. Like love it. But recently Ive noticed that even though I have unlimited data of all apps this is the only one doing this- it always says no connection and is so terribly slow. Like Instagram you can do better
"Spam, spam and wait for it... more spam. Instagram has a SERIOUS spam bot problem. It doesn&#39;t matter how many times I report a disgusting video on the explore page, it comes back tenfold from hundreds of other accounts. I&#39;ve watched the same giant, pus-filled pimples getting popped over and over again, it&#39;s absolutely disgusting. I get tagged in giant message groups for NO reason except for some spam bot to promote their other bot/spam accounts and I also get tagged in porn bot/porn related photos constantly I don&#39;t go looking for these kinds of accounts, my account is locked for privacy reasons and yet here I am still dealing with the same crap day in and day out. I used to love Instagram, but I&#39;m so sick of the bot problem It never gets resolved I&#39;m deleting Instagram indefinitely at this point. I know this issue isn&#39;t exclusive to Instagram, but they absolutely have it the worst"
No Support for Hacked Users. Hey Instagram Respond to my emails and help me get my account back from someone that has taken it over and is pretending to be me  I mean youre all over cyber bullying but is this not another form? Stealing someones identity on social media land holding it hostage??Why do you not have a support contact for hacked users? You dont take internet security seriously.  I would appreciate your prompt response
this site is a dump. too many ads tell mark zuckerburg if hes gonna sell personal data then the users whos data is being sold deserve a dividend. and work on weeding out fake accounts it seems you guys have absolutely no grasp of the concept of how to prevent fake accounts from being created. its a joke really. thats why you get one star. my 6 year old could weed out spam better than you guys
IG needs to add the feature how to remove when I last active. Idk why it needs to display when I was last active on my messenger or if I have seen the message. I would like a little bit more control on what I want it displays to others. A bit more privacy control. Cool app but the Ads need to stop coming up on the feed. Its now becoming like Facebook which I no longer have an account. Theres needs to be an option to complete opt out of Ads
"instagram Please read. I had my account posted as business because i liked the general/primary feature and the little thing in my bio i thought it was cute. I recently saw that i cant post music anymore becayse i am a business account, this has happened on all of my accounts. Ive switched back my accounts to personal and still dont have my music back. if youre reading this please respond My instagrams are xxdesolation.rowxx and xxdestr0yaxx. I would like my music feature bsck please"
Pretty disturbing. I cant believe they allow women to show almost the whole personal parts. Even make a video. But yet wont allow me to open up an account because I wont open up my contacts or pictures to them
"Unreliable. I used to love insta but I feel so bad as they disabled my account without any reason. I had a clean account with all my friends and family, no unknowns added all my personal posts which are all gone now as I dont have those photos and memories anymore. I never got any warnings about anything but they decided to disable my account out of nowhere. They wont even have a valid reason why they did that. Totally unexpected and dismayed"
Invading personal privacy. For the terms and conditions on December 20 they will make it so when your using the camera they can see through it and take records of it. They can also see all your photos on your phone. Once its 20 of December they dont give you a choice
"Doesnt work at all. I just got a new phone and Im trying to make a new Instagram account,my WiFi is perfectly fine and working greati put in all of my personal information my gmail,phone number ect. And then when I got to user name it wouldnt let me make the account even though the user name was available.then it had said it suspected suspicious activity from my account and that I had to confirm I wasnt a robot,I did that,made me put in my phone number and then put in a code,I did that.guess what it said after.unstable internet connection and my WiFi is working perfectly fine Im really disappointed instagram"
"Cant update info. I cant edit my profile or update my personal information. Ive tried everything. Updating app, software, restarting phone, uninstalling the app and reinstalling the app and nothing works. Its very frustrating"
"Hacked. It is ridiculous at how slow instagram is at getting rid of scams. My account just got hacked yesterday. They changed my email, phone number and password on my account but not my username. Now the hacker is using my account for ransom and using my account with my picture and my name for bad things. I have reported my own account  so many times and I have reported that my account has been hacked and have still not heard back from instagram about how I can atleast close that account. Now all of my personal and quite private conversations and all of my memories are all out in the world and I cant do anything about it. This pisses me off to the max. If I could I would speak to the creator of instagram myself on this issue. But that is 1-1,000,000 chances. Fu_k this app"
"Instagram. At 1st I loved this app till I was scammed n my acct hacked n taken over this morn by Amanda Thompson at email:companyf5999@gmail,she took over my whole acct nPersonal info n Im not able to retrieve my acct n as of right now,nothing is bein  donee Im still unable to recover my orig acct so I had to create a new,so thx Instagram,bc I cant even login 2 even delete that acct n report her to proper ppl"
Hacked account. My account was hacked I have reported it instagram wont delete the account they are now posting videos and pictures of my 13 year old sister and telling people to scam them in bitcon I want the account deleted I have gotten people to also report it but it is not getting deleted they are now texting people from the account I need the account deleted and the pictures deleted
"I love Instagram. I think Instagram is a awesome way to chat with friends, meet new people, and a great way to entertain Instagram is also very protective of others privacy and I like that. I will continue to share it with others. Thank you for this amazing app"
"Garbage app, about as free as soviet russia. Free conversation is impossible, prepare to be censored and demonized at the slightest offense. Not political, not even typically offensive. Saying shut up can get you banned because the little rats running Facebook dont like freedom of expression. Also have fun getting more data stolen from you than a Chinese diplomat.0/10 - comparable to a wet diarrhea fart"
Wont work. For whatever reason my Instagram will only work when I am on a wifi network. When Im trying to use Instagram off of cellular data nothing will load and the app always says that it Cant Refresh or its will say No Internet Connection when I have full bars of LTE. Super annoying because I really enjoy the app when it works properly. Please fix this issue
Ig messed up big time. Instagram added a terrible feature that basically ruins this as a platform for keeping track of family and friends.Now Instagram refuses to let you scroll back to revisit recent posts of people you follow. Instead it forces you to look at stupid ads for other accounts that they think that you are going to like. Its incredibly demeaning
"Add to your own story. All of my friends happen to have the feature that allows you to share someone elses post on their Instagram for over a year now. I still dont have that feature and it can be frustrating at times. Ive updated my app several times, checked my privacy settings but I still dont have the feature. Is there a way to remedy this?"
"Terrible/nonexistent customer service. My account was hacked during a data breach, and within seconds of the breach my account was disabled. With no number to call and no email to ask for help, the only help offered from Instagram is through their FAQ page. Even through requesting help through the app all I got were automated responses. I lost my account and Instagram/Facebook did absolutely nothing to help"
"Most recent update. Until recently, I have been able to share both of my Instagram accounts (one personal, one for my record collection) to my personal Facebook account. The most recent update no longer lets me do this. Boo"
"Instagram. Love the name, love what one can do, dont like all the privacy I give up to have it, but dang it, lol"
"Absolutely Love. In the beginning I didnt know how this whole thing worked , but I discovered you can find anything on here and its amazing  I love this app a lot and the filter  And also you can have a private page too Im using this for my game app and my personal life too Better then Facebook by a long shot  Minor glitch but its okay "
"Account Locked for No ID. Instagram soft lock my app upon opening my account of 6 years prompting me to enter my date of birth, after entering a fake date of birth (as you do on the internet to protect personal information), I was greeted with a message that informed me my account will be blocked permanently unless I submit proof of my age with my GOVERNMENT ID All to prove I am over 13 years old. I HAVE A FULL BEARD AND A HOUSE ON MY IG, what else do you need?"
My account was hacked and Instagram wont help me get it back. Hackers got into my account and changed my password email and phone number.The emails I received from Instagram to retrieve it had broken links and there is NO WAY I can find to contact Instagram for help. My page is also a business page.If any developers read this please contact me HELP
No more authenticity. I want to see chronological posts .Lol I see the same ppl and its harder to get out there..marketing is marketing and Im sure selling info and all that other bulls hit is great but at least let me see what I want while you do it. Im in my last IG days
"Love Instagram... Can\'t use it. I use Instagram daily, both for pleasure and for work. But over the last 6 months it\'s become literally unusable. For a few months, it locked me out of my account on almost a daily basis, asking me to reset my password. I complied and kept using the app (quite normally mind you, liking around 20-50 pics a day, sending a few dms, and adding maybe 2-10 new accounts a day). I believe they tried to fix the problem recently by adding in a face recognition captcha which was way easier and pretty helpful. But then the dreaded restriction 49 error started. Literally daily. I can\'t use the app. I\'m \shadowbanned\ I believe? I use the app normally, no spamming and nothing out of the ordinary. I didn\'t get hacked. I have no 3rd party apps. I made my account private. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I changed my password multiple times. Nothing works. I get blocked daily. I use the app for a couple of hours after I\'m unblocked, and poof: restriction 49. I don\'t understand an app that punishes you for using it lol. Can anyone help? There is no way to contact Instagram and the error notifications do nothing. This app is now garbage"
Good. Because you can Explore Speak ur Peace Share an Obtain info
An application without privacy. An application without privacy and Racist
"The new insta?. Its been 5 days now and I am not able to see recent   activity. I also noticed that the app itself is extremely slow. Dont get me wrong, I use Instagram daily But these tiny flaws make me want to delete. Ill be thinking my phone has no data or WiFi but nope Just the app Its weird"
"Bug fix. Please update or fix instagram as Im not able to see anything on my personal page (my photos), while I can browse through the other pages without any problem.. knowing that the app is updates to the last version"
Messages. This is ridiculous Ive been blocked from my messages for a week now. I use my Instagram for school and work as well as my personal life so messages is something I actually need. Ive sent a report every day to Instagram and yet nothing has changed. This is ridiculous. Until this has changed they have my lowest rating
What is going on??. What is up with the bot spam messages from my followers? And why isnt it letting me change my profile picture whenever I want?
"Ruin your privacy by this app. Very addictive with no real value, by using this app you choose to ruin your privacy and make yourself more alone"
Post Orders. I love Instagram its great. I am having a bit of a hard time getting visability but theres also  millions of people who use instagram. Something I think would improve the app by FAR is being able to re-order/ move around your personal posts. I hate re-uploading or deleting posts because it doesnt match the aesthetic and it would be so much nicer if I could just move some posts around. Thanks. Really hope this gets put into consideration
"Im locked out of my account. Instagram locked me out of my account for no reason. Its saying that Im too young and that if there was a mistake, I should make an appeal. Ive made like 20 appeals but My account is still locked. So I tried to download my data from my account since they were saying they were going to delete my Instagram. Its not letting me do that either. Its telling me that I should re-login to my account so I could see my file or whatever and once I login again, it takes me right back to saying Youre not old enough for an account and that if theres an mistake to make an appeal. My account is about to be deleted but I really need it back. I dont know what to do"
"Hacked Instagram. My Instagram got hacked over a month ago. They verified the account was mine, but still send the security code to the hackers email. This means I still cant actually access my account. Youd think theyd have some work around for this, but they dont. This company is so poorly run. Its all tech and no real people"
"Instagram removed my account with no reason. I had used Instagram for 5 years and all those 5 years of memories just disappeared in a second where or I was messaging to my friend. It logged me out without me pressing the button. It didnt let me in at all until I put in the confirmation code for what. I didnt logged out. No confirmation code was sent to me. I asked my friend to see if my account is still there. And nope its gone, completely gone and disappeared forever. I tried everything, I waited 3 days to try again and nothing. This made me so angry because no warning and its like they delete u for fun. I didnt do anything wrong. It was just a personal account. I created a new account and now it says restricted limit I havent been on the account for a minute and it doesnt let me like or comment people post anymore. I deleted the app over and over again and nothing. Whats the point of contacting customer support when u are least likely to get a human interaction. Theres no point. Its frustrating. I never had a problem with instagram for the last few years and it just happened to me now. I have seen on reddit and those other website that this had happened to people and just not me. And help doesnt solve anything aside from if u have been hacked which normally they will alert u in your email but nothing. "
"Probably clam down with the new updates,or fix this problem. Ok so kinda ever since Instagram new updates its been acting up Period because like one minute it be good but then like when I try to take a picture using the filters that I SAVED be gone so then I have to restart my phone and delete the app and reinstall to be good again, another problem is when Im taking a boomerang pic using the filters and then going to SAVED THE PICTURE Instagram says couldnt saved. Instagram doesnt have photos access then I got to my setting and MY PHOTOS ACCESS IS ON. So idk what it is but Instagram is a good app I had it for so long theres has been some up and downs just please fix it"
The Best. Except some people steal our pictures and use it to create fake accounts
Hey. Hey today if to my account hacked by someone in Nigeria sadly gave me no choice to make a new account and one thing I have to say is instagram needs to hav a better security even though I put it wasnt me trying to log in to my account it still got hacked it need a better security and better way to recover a hacked account
Toxicity. Yall should do a better job on spam fake accounts and get rid of more trolls ... other than that Instagram is 
"No support. Ive been having issues with my account for weeks and theres no way to contact any one for help. Ive reported the problem multiple times within the app, Ive checked the entire help tab on the app as well, and Ive DM-Ed the actual Instagram account and have no help fixing the problem. Theres no contact info and I haven&#39;t heard anything from the app about my submissions. Its extremely frustrating to keep trying to find information on how to fix my accounts problems with no help from the actually app"
Unable to re-share my own post. This has been going on for about a week and a half Im unable to re-share my own post let alone anyone elses in my story. My page is also a business page makes it totally difficult for me to share Content. When I make a Reel now im unable to share it to my story and post hey new post. Everybody knows that most people that youre looking for to track insights engagements are based off of what you sharing your story. I went to my privacy settings everything is the same I dont understand how the app just completely took out me being able to share even my own post. This needs to be fixed. Instagram name @nerylb sincerely fix it
mark zucc get out my business. stop spying on me babe if you want me just say it u know i want that facebook money 
Not working. I havent been able to change my bio my profile picture or link my Facebook account Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app Ive tried deleting the data but nothing still works I dont get notifications and I cant see who likes my posts or follows me it keeps saying unknown server error every time Or unknown network error
"What has the world come to. Ive been using this app for a very long time. Since it started. I believe its contributed to my mental health problems, as well as many other peoples mental health problems. I plan on deleting it someday, when I have a chance to download my data. Its sadly addicting and horrible for the world, in my opinion"
Censorship. Freedom of speech exists in America and Im sick and tired of anything surrounding covid or conspiracies to be censored. It is ridiculous and go against my constitutional right to privacy and freedom in the land I call home
"Instagram account hacked, cant get it back. I have an Instagram account which was hacked. The number, email, and password were changed and I cant use the face recognition due to my profile picture being me from 2002 and I posted zero feeds. Ive only posted stories. I tried I cant get it back. I dont want this hacker spamming my friends horrible messages and hacking them. Instagram needs to improve on this"
locked out of my accounts. it is refusing to let me back into my account even tho i have my password and access to the email i signed up with and my facebook thats connected to it but no matter what i do it wont let me in without a code its sending to my old phone number i got a new phone with a new phone number and now i cant login to my instagram that is also connected the my photography/business instagram and my second account please help me
"too many thot bots and scammers. IG has pretty much hit the point where there are more thot bot (likely scammers/bots/catfish) account that display very inappropriate and honestly vile pictures with links to porn sites and cash apps to pay them. scammers or real wh0res, its disgusting. but it doesnt stop there. i get so many follow requests from people selling weed products and so many other illegal drugs. IG has the audacity to review 90% of these accounts and decide its NOT against their community guidelines and will let the drug sales and thot bots continue to bait people. cant forget the hundred of messages i will get in my request box (always links to explicit sites) from yet again, a thot bot page, or scammers requesting to contact them about being some brand ambassador. thats not even all of it but what you can gather from this is all i see is nothing but scammers and these thot bots making accounts, bait comments and the spam messages. been done with facebook for 5 years and sad to say IG is next with the amount of garbage i see there daily"
Buffers constantly. Every video and story I try to view it buffers every other second and nothing ever loads. It is NOT my internet/data connection because Ive tested other apps multiple times. Honestly sick of using it and about to delete it. Also theres an AD every third post. Instagram used to be nice to use and now its just gone to crap
"I cant update. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled Instagram, Ive cleared half of my storage, restarted my phone, switched from data to wifi and my Instagram still doesnt update, my friends have the update and I dont and they also have an iPhone XR like me"
Annoying Algorithms. Algorithms set to work around business accounts ruins the enjoyment of personal account users. Its harder to find decent people willing to interact now and hashtags are now pointless as I get barely any likes from them. I dont always get shown who likes my photos till five or ten minutes after the fact
"Still like it, but. I like the app, I have been on it for about three years. I had (still have) two accounts. One personal, and one public. Well, my former public account was hacked, and even though I tried to do everything Instagram told me to do, the hacker still has my account. The worse part is that you have no place to turn. Theres not an email, or a way to inform instagram that the account is hacked. I have reported, send the videos that prove that I am the rightful owner, but nothing happens. Theres no response from instagram at all. This lack of accountability from Instagram, and Meta is frustrating. This hacker is using my account to scam people, and Instagram is allowing this. Shameful"
The bestest app out there. So IG (insta) (Instagram) is awesome I like how you can make it personal
"Unfair Censorship. They will ban any account that is slightly right of the Overton Window while keeping up accounts that wish for death upon major world politicians, threaten murder upon individuals, doxx (reveal private personal information about others) users, and even accounts that blatantly show the cruel killing of animals and people. Otherwise, Im a fan of the user layout, though it took me a while to find out how to upload Reels"
"IG was much better bitd. The personal TL is so full of ads and suggested post now its hard to see the actual accounts you follow, I thought this was the whole point of the discover tab, its disappointing. Also when will users in Europe get reactions in chat like the US users? why is this an issue, how are emojis a data protection risk??"
action blocker. why when i try to login into my instagram on my personal phone it doesnt let me even if i try to make an new account .soo instagram is actually being a bad app
"iPad App Now Plz. Facebook needs to make a proper iPad app.  Its unbelievable that a $780 Billion company doest have a working app for the iPad.  I have multiple devices for work and personal purposes and its crazy to think that the only way to truly experience IG is on a mobile device.  People are getting iPads as substitutes for personal computers now for a multiple of reason and the fact that the forward thinking company that is FB/IG hasnt created a iPad app is mind boggling.  Plz fix, thx"
"Instagram not working. Instagram isnt working for me right now. I dont know what happened but I havent been able to load my feed, see peoples profiles, or see my dms. Im getting annoyed because there are several people trying to reach me, DM is the only way they can, and I cant respond or see their messages. Can you please fix this ASAP. It is clearly a problem with instagram because my wifi and data are fine; everything else on my phone is working perfectly. PLEASE FIX THIS"
Turned for the Worse. App is very intrusive and tracks a lot about you.  Like a scary level of tracking. Also advertisements increased a lot to an extent that you&#39;re almost seeing the same amount of advert content to content posted by people you follow.  This app lost its value proposition for me and it saddens me since I have used it for so many years
"Suggested pages to follow. The suggested pages/people to follow on my personal feed is annoying. Having it on the explore page is fine, but my personal feed should be for the accounts I have followed myself"
"Newer update . Instagram is legit, but this new update is irritating. I dont want to see explorer feed stuff on my regular personal following feed. Suggest pages to follow on the explorer when Im seeking new things to watch. With the way it is now, my entire regular feed is cluttered with random accounts its suggesting to follow and I dont even have enough time to scroll down long enough to get to see my actually friends and families posts"
"My brand new account got disabled again . Ive been making new accounts because you disabled my main personal account for no reason and I didnt violate any community guideline terms, but every time I make a new Instagram account it keeps on getting disabled. I had two backup accounts, but Instagram disabled one of them even though I confirmed the phone number for that account. Now Im down to my final account where I went to my personal information settings to confirm my phone number. If my last account gets disabled again. I will no longer support or use Instagram and delete this app from my phone. Instagram just lost a customer for their strict unfair ridiculous platform"
"Hacked with no cares from Instagram. My account has been hacked multiple times by someone in Saudi Arabia. I have had my password reset 3-4 times by Instagram to get my account back. I have asked for information on why my account is being hacked, and still no answer. I have put in a request for support for the past few days and have heard from no one. As we speak my account is hacked and my personal photos are free to do whatever the hacker decides. These are photos for the past ten years that I entrusted to Instagram. I believe the least I deserve is a response from an actual human on why my account is compromised"
"Ads are being so annoying. I have made another Instagram account and trust me the ads I see based on the accounts Im following having no relations to the ads. People should be able to decide whether they want to see ads or not. Instagram should not be able to assume something. If we do look at a certain app or account that still shouldnt give Instagram/Facebook permission to invade privacy on certain things to use to advertise on our accounts. Not everyone is ok with advertisements. I dont want to be seeing a clothing, Amazon, Hulu, that I saw from a different app to appear on Instagram. If I wanted to see it on my page I would be following them. Your algorithm is also completely wrong. I havent even been on a related app to whats being shown on my page and it appears. Ever since they got with Facebook its been the worst ever"
"Hacked??. So I was just scrolling on Instagram and then a gray picture of Instagrams logo popped up and told me that I needed to enter a security code and my phone number, so I did all of that and the code didnt come. My friends cannot find my user but they can see that I am still active? I dont know whats going on so please help me"
"Please make it so people cannot see your followers. Please please please give us the option to make it so other people cannot see who we are following. So many bad things can happen because strangers and friends have access to your followers. If we had the option to protect them from others, then that would create much more safety. Please give us that option in the privacy settings"
"Absolutely horrible. Instagram has treated me horribly. Theyve action blocked me for no good reason and there are many problems with stories and privacy. Random people can message u and on my stories, the words sometimes dont show up. Instagram please fix your freaking app Quit action blocking innocent people who are following And also stop action blocking people who are  unfollowing inactive people that dont even use instagram anymore I know this wont be read by instagram but even if they do read it they need to take it into consideration that people are unhappy with action blocks"
"GET CUSTOMER SERVICE. My account was hacked and there is no way to recover it and instagram have 0 customer service, I have been trying to regain access to my account for 2 months and keep receiving unhelpful automated emails"
Account Recovery. My account was hacked and the hacked removed my email address and changed the phone number and password on my account. Instagram says that when this happens they will ask for permission from the original email but I never received such an email. After following all the steps on the help center I still havent been able to get back into my account
"Hacked. A couple days ago, Instagram was down and someone was able to hack my account during that time. When I finally was able to get back on, I noticed someone posted a picture on my page and I deleted it right away. I sent out a request to change my password but didnt get anything until 2 days after. The person who hacked me also sent out spam messages to a bunch of random people I dont know. I deleted/unsend all of the messages that were sent out, now my account has been disabled for because of the actions of someone else and the app security wasnt helpful at all. Id like to get my account back with all of my photos. Please and thank you Username: Kreezuskrist"
I need help getting my account fixed. Hey. So recently none of my Instagram accounts including my personal ones are letting me post like any kind of video. Is there anyway yall could even just get my personal accounts (ashlynhartsell97)&amp; (ashlyn_petsitting)  back up and letting me post videos of my dogs and stuff?
Good. Can instagram add back the section where you can see all the pictures and videos sent in a private chat? It was easier to find pictures and you don&#39;t have to scroll back into the conversation
"Issue with this app privacy need to be fixed. There is only one problem I see with this web based application app which is privacy has to be added ( who can see my following list and my followers list) this need to be hidden in a why only the number of them shown, but no one can view my lists)"
uh?. why are u in my dms removing stuff from there? thats the only privacy i thought i would have but apparently i dont get out my business
Agenda pushers. Covid pushers and privacy violation
Poor connection / new updates. Constant new updates about suggested posts and not people I follow. Have good connection with WiFi or data but instagram is the only app that doesnt work?
"PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM. My instagram account and facebook account linked without me knowing and now i cant get it back. Those are two completely different things for me, and my work and my personal life should be separated. Even with all the research i did, i still could find how to do it, or reverse it. Facebook/Instagram: FIX IT"
"Sick of being unable to share things to story And my friends cant share my posts Full of BUGS. This app is badly built and doesnt work Half the features just disappear randomly with no rhyme or reason And nothing to do with updating the app as my friends having same issues when trying to interact with my account from their appsIm trying to share my friends story and post that he tagged me in to my story, and the add to story button just doesnt appear Additionally, my other friend friend is trying to share my latest video post to his story and similarly the add to story button does not appear And yes all the privacy options about people being able to share your content are completely enabled Absolutely ridiculous especially if you are relying on people sharing your content"
"Gone Downhill. I remember when IG was fun. Now, they are riddled with porn bots and trolls and when you report people who violate the terms, 9 times out of 10 they write back saying the account or post didnt violate the terms, though it clearly did.To top it off, I decided to make a new account for a specific subject and after about an hour of using it, following 45 people or so and making maybe 20 comments, my account was deactivated. They made me send a photo of myself holding a picture of a code and Im waiting to hear back, but this is honestly ridiculous. I didnt violate the terms at all, unless commenting and following people is a violation of their terms, rather than the whole point of Instagram.Tl;dr They let alllll kinds of stuff (bullying, porn, hate speech, etc.) slide but if you comment too many times (?) from a new account you can get deactivated"
"terrible help support group. Ive been using Instagram since 2013, Ive always loved it Until 2021 when my account got deleted for no reason .. and when i appeal for it , i never get any response ?? I have years worth of photos on there . That Ill never get back , pictures of me and my deceased friends I dont have access to any of that anymore .. thanks Instagram"
"Branded Content help. I have a personal account and none of my post are branded content, but in my activity page it says Branded Content and when I tag a location it says Tag a Business Partner. I cant find a way to get rid or to turn these settings off on my personal account. Any help?"
"Scammers. Instagram needs to put in more effort on costumer support. They also need to work more on hacked accounts, scammers, hackers, and identity theft cases. My personal information was changed on my instagram and now its too late to revoke the change or get it back. Now i have someone impersonating me in order to sponsor their scamming business and there's absolutely nothing i can do about it"
"Still spying. Heres a headline from July of 2020: An Instagram bug showed a camera on indicator for iOS 14 devices even when users werent taking photos.Below that: The company says its fixing the issue. Well, its still happening. Either they never fixed it, or it was never actually a bug"
Reporting if a friend got hacked. So on someone hacked my friends account. I know this for a fact. I call my friend and they are away but Instagram is being difficult letting them in. So I decided that Ill report it to Instagram and theres no way to do that. The account itself isnt a fraud someone who isnt him is using it. On other social media platforms I can report that the account has been hacked but not on Instagram. Seems dumb
"Instagram music. Why is it that on my personal IG, the music works but not on my business page? Bogus"
"Terrrrible update & design. What the heck has happened to this app??? In all seriousness, this app used to be AMAZING &amp; now its barely a meh. This is not a app or social media for users to share images with friends anymore. Just one big AD for companies with money. The same thing that happened to fb is going to happen to this app. You developers &amp; designers are doing such a bad job I wonder how these ideas crossed your mind &amp; were approved by anyone. Whoever decided to add a shopping button where the notification button used to be I hope the worst happens to you. like WHY WAS THIS EVEN IMPLEMENTED??? Now when I go see my notifications I click on a stupid wish shop wanna be area that I literally could care 2 f about. I have other apps for shopping. No one asked to combine these 2. If ppl sell on instagram through their small businesses LET THEM No need for this shop button at all. Please get rid of all the new things youve added. Soon NO ONE will use your app &amp; weirdly cant wait for that to happen. On the lookout for the next new social media picture sharing app now"
"Love the app. I love the app but after my account got hacked and I got it back, I havent been able to change me Instagram profile picture"
"Update broke cell data. Cant use insta on cell phone data now. All other apps work fine. Insta will only work wifi now, please update w a fix"
Insta love. Since 2017 Im insta fan I love it The app is like my diary and my work and life documentary of my professional and personal life Thanks for all the hard work on this amazing App To all the team and founders my admiration and respect  thank you Instagram we love you
"HMU Guys,. I was trying to log in everything what I need but some of reasons they easily hacked to breaking in also I dont understand why they got community restrictions to take over your acc that not allowed some to take a posts it easily cause ppl feel frustration about it if you got refuse allowing them to take whatever what they want then this Instagram rank will rise goes down until its very lower. You have to fix and upgrade with these problems. So I like to add something for this Instagram. Why not add these in Instagram to make more interesting and rise rank highly? Like these to add in Instagram:listen long musicplaying video games while youre on video chatsedit the videos or pictures like Funimate or video edits stuff like thatsetting more gifs than few gifs trying make it look like google or something like that.and many more as you can think ofSo anyway I just advice you for these in the Instagram app that way ppl can being on more ppl and no more restrictions over our own accounts cuz it easily make ppl leaving Instagram accounts even more than just few. And thank you for reading these and have a great day :)-Random person"
Please help insta. This is my personal Instagram account. I am not getting the option of Instagram reels in my account. So please enable Instagram reels option in my account
Cannot get in app. I have been having issues with this appI am no longer able to get access to my InstagramI have resettled and even changed my phone. Yet it still tells me its having issues allowing me onIt brings up my information yet no access. Please help. Thank you
Unable to log into account. MY personal photos and information are on Instagram and someone in NIGERIA logged in and has stolen it. They changed My email. Instagram needs to fix THIS This is bullying. And illegal
"Too much. I dont write reviews often but when I do, its because Im extremely satisfied or extremely disappointed. Instagram you guys are doing too much changes to this app which Im extremely disappointed with. You guys and this new update are very useless. You might as well just turn the app into an online shopping app. Its no longer for pictures and enjoying videos which is what we liked. I was dealing with losing the chronological order but yall are seriously losing your brains and cool points. Its too much Also please come up with a way that we can see who unfollowed us so we dont have to use other apps that can hack into our account.Signed: Soo_safiya"
"Privacy Issues/ suggestions. The terms of service are way more invasive; so I would advise anyone getting this app/update to read the terms of service so you know what youre getting yourself into. Another thing is the update with search history; Ive accidentally clicked accounts I dont know and have no interest in, and now they show up in my suggested or feed all the time and its really obnoxious that I cant clear them. Note to the developers:If you want to make customers happy let them have some choice in what content they see; at least let them clear their history so they arent bombarded with ads they arent interested and stuff in their search history that they didnt even want to search for. Its just obnoxious and is becoming stressful to use. What if my interests change? Clearing history lets you start over and it feels more organized so you dont have a bunch of junk or accounts you dont follow anymore showing up in the search tab or recommended. Even Google lets you do that to a certain extent"
. Love it... I like to share pics.. but I like my privacy
Hacked account. Recently both of my Instagram accounts were hacked and Instagram isnt doing anything to help me gain access to my accounts again. I wasnt the only one hacked it has happened with other people. Im asking that Instagram do better to stop these hackers from stealing others accounts and using them to scam people
Hackers. Somebody keeps hacking my account and I keep reporting it and nothing is done. And hes gotten so far to them having my personal information and harassing mean also off the app.  No one seems to care
"New Update. The new update is absolutely annoying. I cant see recent posts without having to click on older posts from people I follow. And if I dont click on that it just displays ONE new picture from someone I follow. Every time I get on this app all I see is that. Which at this point has gotten on my nerves. Just that one recent picture which is 7 hours old now. Even if I refresh the page I dont get an update of recent posts with other people I follow. Before the new update it changes constantly and I know some people that I do follow post on a daily basic. Change the format back. I rather scroll on my feed to see post of people I FOLLOW. Not the stupid suggest posts on my feeds. Change it back to how it was. This is incredibly stupid. Its more stupid having another button to see older posts on my personal page. Stop putting explore page videos/posts of people I do not follow on the personal page. I get on Instagram multiple times a day and I do use the explore page a lot. Keep the personal page separate from the explore page. That is beyond ridiculous. Why are you changing the format? I dont want to see suggested posts on my personal page. Change it back to where when I scroll on my personal page, it just displays posts from people I follow. Stop including the explore page on the personal page. KEEP THEM SEPARATE. Literally have a personal page button and an explore page button for a reason. Keep it that way"
Suggestion. I love the app yet I see it should be like fb from the privacy perspective of who youre following and who is following you. It should be an option if I want to hide them and only the number appears or be hidden as well.Looking forward to see this option
Awesome. After a long time of begging my parents I finally got it its great for sharing with your friends what you are doing and it works great on cellular data
"Give us the old layout. Im not a business account. Im a personal account so, why do i need the shopping cart? I never use it and im sure a majority people dont use it either.  It wastes space on layout. Also the reels, i dont want to use tiktok on instagram. At least keep them in the feed not on the screen layout. These are horrible changes and we cant even change it back"
Disabled my personal account for no reason. Ive had this same Instagram for 5 years never had any issues and now my I cant even log into my IG the worst part is that they dont offer any customer support
"App Inconsistency to help. My account been temporarily disabled for me trying to defend and protect myself. Instagram dont care, they dont look at the problem at hand before concluding if someone should get disabled or not. Its so annoying its been weeks almost a month that Ive been logged out of my Instagram and cant sign back in. I also cant log into one of my other pages on the app but can do so on the website, this is irritating. If u do decide to get a account your on your own, cause if u get hacked or harassed u cant do nothing. Because Instagram dont help"
"Sht app. Ive been on Instagram for years and had no problems with the app until now, the app recently updated and now its completely unusable. Videos freeze up after 2 seconds, I know its not my WiFi or data cause every other social media app works fine"
"Not The Instagram We Knew. The new changes to instagram are really disappointing, and honestly the majority of people I know and myself are finding ourselves to use instagram less and less recently. The chronological ordered feed has been gone for a while, but I feel like I see advertisements more than the posts of people I follow. The filters are mediocre, and the new update also replaced button placements. So now, when you go to see who liked your posts youre more likely to click the shop category. This was obviously a thought out idea because instagram is just about making money now. Its just not fun anymore. The atmosphere of posting for a scrap book type aesthetic is just gone. Its not about making memories or friends. Its about making money for the owners of instagram. Its really sad because I grew up on this app. The only plus side of instagram is the good privacy settings (hence the two stars) otherwise, this is no longer the instagram we once knew and loved"
One problem. Instagram is good and all but for some reason I cant change my profile picture no matter what. Yes I am connected to wifi and I have full bars for my data. Help I cant change my photo please
Hacked account. Ive been locked out my ig account for 3 days now Ive followed all the steps to regain access to my account but Instagram or Facebook wont help me at all. All my information has been comprised My account has been hacked all information has been changed and Instagram sees the changed on the account and still wont help
Insta tv and music option on story post. I cant upload to insta tv because the image isnt there for me to click And I also cant play a music track over a story recording How can I fix ?
"Hands down worst update in Instagram History. Why on earth would Instagram, a photo sharing social media app, replace the notification button with a shopping button?I don&#39;t want to shop, I need to see how my posts are doing, I&#39;m running a business that doesn&#39;t have &#34;merch.&#34;  On top of that on my personal accounts, none of my friends or anyone I follow is selling anything, so instead of having a useable section, I have a blank void to keep falling into every time I want to do the thing their algorithm has programmed me to do... check my notificationsThis is madness.  Please change it back, for the love of God, at least give us the option This is pure, unadulterated garbage.You&#39;re better than this"
"Idk. How come every time I reset my phone (bc sometimes it acts stupid) I dont get any notifications from Instagram, if I wanted to get notifications I have to un download it and get it again and log in..but other then that I love it,"
"My instagram hasnt been working for three days. I dont know what wrong, nothin will load on my feed personal page or search page, its not the internet Ive checked and Ive al really deleted the app and reinstalled it but I still wont work"
"Logged me out cant get back in. Instagram wouldnt let me change my phone number when I tried, then eventually locked me out of my account. And it wont let me in because I dont have access to my old phone number and no one has it and I cant locate it. I hate this app so much because Idk how to contact my friends anymore"
"App bugs, glitches and suggestions. Hey Instagram team, the app is great but theres just a couple things that could be fixed. First off, there are many times where I go press the volume up/down buttons on my phone and the instagram app will just silence the entire video Im watching, and i would have to tap on the video again to activate the sound. This has been happening for a year or 2 now and its across multiple phones so yall should definitely check that out.Secondly, at this very moment, the app keeps freezing and it is VERY annoying. Please fix this. It has been noticed my thousands of users by now and Im surprised it hasnt been fixed yet.Another issue I seem to be facing every now and then is the connection status every time Id like to change something in my bio/profile. For many years now, instagram hasnt been letting me and probably many others, change anything in their bio or username if they arent connected to wifi. Do not confuse this with cellular data. Theres been many times where I have a strong cellular data connection but Instagram says it needs connection for me to change anything about my profile. As soon as I connect to wifi, I am able to make such changes. This is extremely annoying and should be fixed asap.There is one suggestion I have that I think is subtle but the issue happens enough to many people that I think it would be beneficial. This suggestion is to have a feature that lets the user load what was previously showed on the explore page before they refreshed the explore page. There are many instances where users refresh the explore page on habit/instinct and before the explore page refreshes with new content, they (myself included) see a piece of content that intrigues them/wed like to see more of. However, we cannot click or go back to see the piece of content because we refreshed the explore. So maybe add a pop up notification feature that asks the user if theyd like to load the previous explore page results. Thats all I have for now"
"Horrible security. My work account formerly @hairbykristenball was hacked. It was reported by dozens of people, and Instagram did zero to try to recover it for me. I had the account for 7 yrs, and the hacker deleted all of my work pictures and videos, priceless personal and professional pics that I cannot recover. I have lost clients because they can no longer find me, and my new account gets no views because it has so few followers. It was completely devastating and no one at Instagram did a single thing to help. I have no respect for the security or support for this platform anymore"
"The recent 2020 updates are awful. I used to love using Insta for my art account and my personal account, but ever since Instagram added Reels, its SO much worse. I dont have access to a Discovery Page anymore and they keep switching crucial buttons that become muscle memory (such as Like/Follow Activity) the app used to be enjoyable but now its just difficult to use and not as fun"
Further invade my privacy? ffffudge u mark. Deleted app. My account was frozen apparently because of new tos. I havent jumped thru hoops to log back in and not sure Ill be able to. This just further reminds you they own your content and now they want the right to steal all data in your device and computer. F u mark
Privacy. Please stop asking access my contacts every time
"Disappointed. I have been using Instagram for the past 10 years. However, I have been incredibly disappointed with their customer support, or lack thereof, over the past few months. One of my accounts was hacked and turned into an OF account back in January. The username and profile pictures were altered & the account wad interacting with various people. When I found out, I quickly re-set everything to how it previously was, logged any foreign devices out & enabled 2FA. However, a week or so later, Instagram decided to disable my account and I have actively been seeking to communicate with them and submitting multiple complaints on the app in order to get my account back over the past 7 months. Though, I have yet to receive a response. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of response I have received, would give 0 stars if I could"
"Deleted My Account and Dont Care. My account was hacked along with my fb. Insta deleted me for violating terms and just flat out ignored my messages and appeals. I lost memories and my life has been so much harder without messenger to contact business associates and friends. I am ashamed of myself for trusting them with my data, never again. If anyone cares my handle is njrr_brian . Please give me my account back"
"IG. Account getting Hacked. Instagram,i&#39;m really upset at your services and customer service. My instagram account got hacked the hacker has access to my instagram right now,has changed my email. I didn&#39;t recieve a text code. I tried google authentication code and even recovery nothing worked. I sent so many messages on your instagram app even on fb and nothing.You didn&#39;t even help me. So many other people this is happening too. This is very bad for your Reputation"
People arent treated the same. People with more followers have less restrictions. They say they support art but each individual  person at IG uses their own personal idea of what art is to them judging everyone with a different and non standard policy
"Used to be the best..All they care about is money now. I Used to love this app, sharing memories and photos, artists & creators sharing pictures of their work. You posted a picture, people saw it , it was simple. Now all they care about is collecting data & making money . If you use this app for work you will be left feeling frustrated. Their algorithm of late is designed to make you feel like you must spend money booting your posts in order for it to be seen. Its truly lost what made it special and turned into just another £ hungry business"
"Disabled my account. Instagram unfairly disabled my personal account that I had since I was 13years old, and only because supposedly I was pretending to be someone else but I never did that. And I wrote them and they havent give me back my account"
"Ridiculous privacy settings. It is very confusing how to remove my Instragram account from google search, its like a maze  Make it easy"
"Account hacked, threatened etc. NO HELP AT ALL from IG. My accounts were hacked HARD recently. Snapchat, Yahoo, Google, and Apple all helped me within days. I have all accounts back and secure except Instagram. Ive had my account since IG started and the hacker changed the email and phone number associated with the account. They have freely posted my SSN, drivers license, inappropriate photos, and threatened me and my family for money. Everyone has reported the account, Ive left voice messages, reported in every way possible and have been working with police. I cannot imagine the damage that has been done to my reputation and my life because of this identity theft. Instagram has been silent for almost two weeks. Police cannot get a hold of them. I am so shocked IG has done nothing to support me or help me through this. Unbelievable"
Account Deleted. Someone hacked my account. Instagram acknowledged my reset attempt but deleted my account instead of letting me regain access. Talking to a live customer service representative probably would have made things a lot simpler
Those permissions?. Im surprised they havent asked if weve brushed our teeth every time we turn our phone on.  They track just about everything else
"Cant like or follow. Instagram has been running smoothly for me for the last 6 or 7 years that Ive had it, but 3 weeks ago my account got restricted and I can no longer like posts or follow people and it is very frustrating Keep in mind that I have a personal Instagram account and I am not behaving in any way that would require me to be restricted (liking too many posts, commenting too much, etc.) I have done everything to fix the problem like delete and reinstall, stop using the account for a week, and report the problem to Instagram and yet have still gotten no help. I actually do not know what else I should do and I dont want to recreate a new account. @instagram PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM"
"WHAT. Whats happened??? With this latest update, the only page thats showing up is my personal profile. I have no home page, no explore page, no way to post a new photo, no notifications tab, nothing. Just my profile. I cant see my friends posts anymore. Whats going on Instagram??? Its supposed to be social media, and the only thing I can see is myself"
Latest update for Instagram. I lost all my dm messages and not getting any notifications and I have them turned on also I got hacked and other people are getting hacked
"Being hacked and had no help. My account @t_lovey_dovey was hack this year and they have been stealing my new post on my new account @marbleclaws_ . The proof is in the recent post that they stole from my account. I reported the account. Instead of disabling the account to make sure no one else can get hacked; Instagram said, This act was not against guidelines for the app. Which I think this is identity theft. I do not appreciate that lack of enforcement and care this company has for there account members. I am very disappointed"
"No Help At All. Hi, Ive been having issues with my Instagram for 3 years now and have gotten 0 help or explanation for the problems Ive been facing with the platform. I cant even sign in through the app it doesnt say my account was disabled nor does it say I violated any terms it says there was an error with your request I never did anything wrong this all happened when I took my old account down and deleted it because I thought someone hacked it 3 whole years ago so Ive been using Safari since then on my other account that was not disabled and had nothing wrong with it accept for whatever reason not being able to sign in through the app, its repeatedly locked me out for suspicious activity for looking at photos and using my Instagram and thats it. Tonight it locked me out again for looking at a clothing page and made me send a video of my face to prove Im a real person. Please help this is so sad that I cant have a platform like everyone else my age does and I didnt even do anything. 0 help whatsoever I fr tired to even make a new account and it said I violated guidelines which I fr never did it just doesnt want me to have a platform. I tried everything thanks Instagram for 0 help or explanation I guess Im just not good enough for a platform"
"Few issues. Instagram is so much fun, I really love it. I have some less pleasant parts I would like to share: - far too many ads in the feed and in the story. A little creepy that ads are pulled from websites I view in safari... story ads are every 1-4 stories for me. Its too much about shopping and less about personal relationships, especially when we rely on Instagram to keep up with friends during COVID. - really missing the following page to see who likes what posts. This is how I found new people and accounts to follow- timing of lyrics and songs sometimes off in stories"
"new update/terms of service. your new update and your new terms of service are HIGHLY questionable. the new update in question targets sex workers, and will directly harm and tarnish the people who make their money from sex work. also, the new terms of service states, essentially, that we give you permission to access our data - our call logs, our background apps, etc. this is a violation of EVERYONES privacy. the terms are so loose on purpose so that you can create loopholes, and so you can claim that you cant be penalized. do better"
Can't take photos or send photos. It says to update my privacy settings but then does not give me the option in settings to allow access photos or camera or microphone
"Wisdom. Best ever app to receive and share information ,it cool to use"
"Story Post without Mic and Camera. I updated the app and now I cant post photos or videos to Story without giving the app access to microphone and camera. I dont want to do this. Nor is it necessary. There is no reason to gray out the photo selection button and force you to enable microphone access unless you are trying to collect our data. This is not an update. The new feature takes away, does not add. I am now considering deleting Instagram for a healthier life and more free time after wasting 20 minutes googling around trying to figure out how to post without giving microphone access"
"Loosing touch. Instagram continues to go down hill. The loss of likes, not bein in chronological order, not being to see previous data posts, every third post being an add. Its not made for the consumer anymore. On top of that the marketplace option that we all hate and there not bein an app for the iPad? Instagram just isnt enjoyable anymore"
"Too many hackers on the platform. When I first got my instagram account, I didnt have a problem with it until like recently and I had the other page for years. Hackers are hacking in accounts and using it for trading especially for Bitcoin. And thats ok that you want to get the word out and have clients but Instagram doesnt let you get your account back or at least verify if its you once your account is hacked. The creator of Instagram should have a security feature where Instagram freezes the account until you verify it so that hackers wont change all your information in matter of seconds. Im still waiting from Instagram to take down my havked account because its using it for Bitcoin and it still has my old followers and my highlight with pictures like Instagram has turned into an easier way for Identity Theft because of all the hackers getting easy access into accounts. Im really disappointed and angry Im so close to trying to delete all my accounts and taking down Instagram. Do better Instagram"
"Ads. There are wayyyyy too many ads. Before I typed up this review, I saw a total of 6 ads in one minute. Also, the new privacy policy is really weird. Make sure to read it"
"Please help to reactivate my account. My Instagram account : kayleeexo has been disabled without clear reason. Ive been following the terms of use, only used a third party app, its not clear stated in the Terms of use that we cant use third party app. I started using my account since 2011, I have lots of personal information, photos and videos in the account.... Its really important to me Please help to reactivate my account"
"Susan. I signed up for instagram for the first time because of the boredom due to the epidemic. I enjoyed the live dJs and all of a sudden on Thursday May 28, 2020 Instagram said there was suspicious activity when I was just browsing through the makeovers and the Christian preachers that I enjoy. Instagram asked me for my ID and I did so and they threw me out of instagram. I went by the name of susan5afroboriqua and after waiting 24 hrs. they deleted my account with all my personal pictures how dare they What sort of platform does this? I think this is horrible. I demand a explanation"
"Internet connection. I have unlimited data on my phone but every time I go into my Instagram it keeps saying not connected to internet and wont load anything. Ive updated, reset my phone, and even tried to connect to my internet, nothing seems to be working"
Way too many Sex bots that they refuse to take care of. Theres literally hundreds of thousands of fake accounts that constantly tag you in random Inappropriate posts. Theres tons of spam accounts that add you into group chats to Take their pants off. If you report them instagram wont take them down because they would like to focus on Things that are actually harming the community. So annyoing
Really need this update. I use Instagram everyday for personal and business use. I would put the rating to 5 stars if theyd just remove auto updates. I cant count the amount of times Ive been in the middle of reading a post and Instagram has decided that I need to see a fresh new set of posts and then completely remove the post I was trying to read from my feed
"messages. there should be an option to unsend all media you have sent to someone because exes and old friends having pics of you that you dont want and stuff takes ages to go through, and deleting whole conversations from both inboxes as private conversations between you and other people are there forever"
"Bugs or account getting hack. instagram is great to keep you entertaining. Unfortunately, My account was logged in from another device which I do not own. I know this happened because I received a verification code on my phone which I did not requested for. Ive been logged out 2 times within months. (Apparently, your system has a bug or Ive been hacked many time.) I did not log my account anywhere but my own devices And had to reset my password again and again Which I already did. Please update ur security system"
My account was hacked and there is no one to help. My account was hacked 3 days ago. I used my account for business and made money I also spent money on Instagram app. And there is no one to help I hate Instagram
"No profile pic. Help I cant download a profile pic. Instagram keeps telling me I have a poor internet connection, which I dont, and Ive tried using my data and I get the same message.Ive deleted the app, reinstalled it and updated. Still no luck. Please fix"
"Cant see the views on my story. My view count will say 40+ people viewed it and only let me see 5. I logged in on my laptop and I can view them there, but not on my phone. I contacted Instagram several times and they have not given me a response, so Im just left with a broke app. I already did everything I could. Delete reinstall, clear data, restart, nothing wrong on my end"
Stop selling my information. My intsagram experience goes alittle something like this*my Feed- post- post*Advertising -post * more Ads-post -post *ads baby more ads
Wouldve been 5 stars but. My business IG page is fine. No issues. But my personal page feed hasnt updated in over a week. Ive refreshed. Ive done a hard reset on my phone. Ive deleted and reloaded the app. Same.Crap.on.My.Feed.For.9DAYS. Ridiculous
"Satisfaction survey. My account was hacked a while back, so I reported it, blocked the account, and told my followers to do the same. I got a notification back from Instagram saying they are far to busy to look into my claim and to block the hacker of I didnt want to see the notifications. Mean while the fake account continued to hit up my followers"
Awful application. This app is awful because it doesnt respect to users and uses their information illegally
"Selfless. After having an account with instagram since 2012, I have completely lost my account, my connections and friends made over the years. Instagram had become so popular that we stopped asking for number and only instagram names. As a daily active user, I was extremely bothered by the fact no one can help me get my hacked account back. Two major factors that have lead me to the decision of not using it ever again were as followed. Their help center is pointlessly a dead end, you will get no help. Leads you to countless instructions that you can not do or simply are not even available. The second factor, instagram allowed a change in my personal account selection for an email that does not exist, and a number that does not exist. Not only that, whoever the hacker is continues to use the same fake email and number on other accounts. Prior to FB buying Instagram this was not allowed. Stick to snapchat they know their value in what they have created. Instagram, just like facebook will be something from the past as a better secured app will appear"
"bad merging. some people have their instagrams so that they can have maybe a facebook account for just family i think that this is a extreme invasion of privacy and this honestly may cause me to be forced to disable my account , keep the platforms separate thats why they are different apps"
"Instagram doesnt care about bullied disabled people. I am a person with mental and physical disabilities. Despite all that I had an amazing and supportive following of over 8000. And then the harassment started. The impersonations, the threats, the hacking... I had this account for maybe three years and I went from wanting to die and give up on all my hopes to feeling like maybe even I am capable of anything, even healing somehow with all this support... to being disabled. My account is now disabled. Just. Like. Me. They said my account had strange activity and that I was breaking the rules. The fact I was hacked and brutally harassed so much in the passed four months (or more) means nothing to them. No one was ever blocked. Fake accounts with my personal name and images of me stayed UP. I plead my case and they have kept it disabled from me. I showed them IDs with personal info, I showed them pictures of me. Nothing. Back to no support. The bullies have won and hurts my heart so bad. Instagram isnt safe, I guess. I really hope that they put things back, but... it doesnt look good. I feel so damn alone. I guess no matter what you do, no matter what you try. It always gets taken away"
"IG Ignores My Reports. There is an account pretending to be me and I have reported it 22 times and my followers have also reported it numerous times. This spam account is soliciting personal banking/credit card info from my followers and its killing my brand as other accounts are confused. For this reason IG as a social platform gets 1 star, if I could - it would get no stars"
"My Account got hacked. I really like Instagram, its my favourite of the social medias but my account got hacked and I got locked out. I then realised I hadnt updated my phone number or email and cant receive the security code. Would anyone be able to help with getting access to my account?"
"Instagram deleted a button for me. When my followers tagged me in posts, I used to be able to share it on my story, and visa versa. This never was an issue, even with private accounts. But all of a sudden, whenever I get tagged, or I tag my friends, no one can share. When i check my settings, my Instagram privacy setting looks different - the allowing followers to share your post and story post is missing. I wonder why? Ive even deleted the app, and updated it but still to no avail"
"Stop the Updates. Since the new updates this week I am unable to access my edit profile options. When I click the button it times out leaving me unable to change my bio, contact info, or anything else. My contact information has since changed leaving people to wonder why the phone line is not working. Instagram needs to have a support number/email that is actually in use to deal with these issues. The report an issue button does not help when it remains unfixed and unanswered"
"Dear, Instagram. Hi Instagram team, I really love this app its a fun way to make new friends, meet people, build strong relationships, pictures, hear about stories, watch our idols, inspirations, memes, influencer stuff, see our crushes pictures and vice versa. LITERALLY EVERYTHING about Instagram is gorgeous but I do have something that I really want the Instagram team to have for particular reasons it would mean a lot if you guys added a new feature. I was wondering if by any chance can you add a hide your message feature for privacy purposes so no one can snoop and read your DMs like to certain purposes. My mom read mine and my boyfriends dms by accident 2 weeks ago and it was embarrassing so same goes for all the couples and people who may need it. It would help a lot. Thanks for hearing me out Hope you and the Instagram team are having an amazing day.  thanks again"
"DELETED MY IG FOR NO REASON WTH NO WARNING. Instagram deleted my account on the middle of a video chat call, saying that my account has been reported for suspicious activity and to send a code to my phone, never sent the code after trying multiple times , when trying to log in my username isnt found but I cant sign up using my email address because its in use  I DIDNT DO ANYTHING. But they let porn accounts stay and all other inappropriate accounts Probably stole all of my personal info. I wish I could give 0 stars for being a piece of crap app and no kind of CS"
"Why is this app hot garbage?. Not sure when it started but the images do not load if my WiFi connection is anything short of perfect/fast. I have cellular data turned on for this app, yet I cant get images to load for longer than 5 minutes on the app before I get the Could not refresh feed error, or the images are just greyed out. Seeing as the images are the entire point of Instagram, its fair to say that its not doing its one job"
"APP IS TRASH. The Instagram app keeps crashing and glitching Every time I go to open the app it closes and take me to my homescreen. Also, every time I do get a chance to get on the app I have to use my data because it wont load the feed or anyones pages at all using my very good WiFi only while using all my data. This needs to be fixed"
"Feedback_required. How can you fix feedback_required on app? I cannot use it i cannot log in, keeps on popping out. Could you fix that please. I have my account but my teens only access my phone to use social media its for their safety and thats our family rules. And when they tend to log in or i log in tru my account keeps on saying feedback_required What is that means. Please fix it. Thank you"
"Was ok, garbage now. Today they forced an update that turned my personal feed into an infinite suggested page. If they dont give us an option to turn it off, Ill be deleting the app. I use it to keep up with friends, not see a thousand posts my strangers. Dumb update"
"No app support whatsoever. Ive had Instagram for several years now; however, when I have come across serious performance issues (I.e not receiving push notifications despite them being turned on everywhere  both on ig and my phone), Instagram has been no help to resolve this. They havent even bothered to reply to my ticket. Ive also experienced issues where you like (heart) something via direct messages and then they disappear from my end, but Instagram has also refused to assist with this. Awesome app when its working. Poor customer service with little to no help. Highly disappointed"
Love. I love this app as long as we can have privacy for every person
Hacked. Instagram does not help with identity theft. Reported account off of many peoples phone to get help and Instagram declined them. MAKE A LIVE CHAT  A hacker is posting ME MYSELF ON MY PAGE. Upgrade your stuff Instagram. Highly disappointed
"Upset. I got an email from Instagram asking if I was attempting to login to my account. I knew it wasnt me so I clicked on the email and it took me into my account. It stated someone from United Arab Emirates attempted to login to my account. I quickly changed my password. Before this, My Instagram was hacked before where the person who hacked my Instagram changed my username, profile picture and password but I was able to gain my account back because it was connected to my Facebook. This time my Instagram got deactivated. I tried multiple times to gain my Instagram back. I kept getting an email stating that my phone number on my account was deactivated so I was not able to get the code to log back into my account and get it back. I sent Instagram a request support and I got an email stating before we can help you, we need to confirm that this account is yours. They want me to reply to the email with a picture of my self holding a handwritten code they gave me, my full name, username and to make sure my face in the picture to see if it matches my pictures on my account. I did that and then I got another email stating, looks like your Instagram was disabled because it didnt follow our terms of use. I did understand why because all the pictures on my account was mines and Ive never posted anything that can cause my account to get disabled. I completed a term request stating why I think my account was deactivated by mistake and I got no response"
"it couldnt get worse. i cant believe after using this app for years its become *this* toxic. the new ux update finally does away with your friends photos, pulling the explore page onto your feed. older photos are banished to another page. they capitalize on your muscle memory by replacing the notification button with a new shopping feature, and the new post button with reels. all of the features that are actually still useful are crammed in the upper right corner. behind instagrams ugly new face is an even uglier algorithm. untenably their algorithm has swiftly proven to be riddled with insidious biases that separate users instead of bringing them closer together. save your phone data and sanity"
Cant fix their app. Been using this for years and always have the same problem of my news feed not loading. I see whats typed a d thats it. Pictures on everything g refuses to load all because they cant take the time to read what we tell them and fix their mistakes
Ideas to make it better. The ad marketing could be improved by letting people list to you what ads they want to see info for. More specific and geared towards a persons own needs by allowing them to choose the nature of ads they see. Put a cap on what types of ads they will see based on their specified interests. Not what you data collect. The human condition will fill the perceived hole of marketing driven by subversive avenues in data farming. Go more natural with your marketing. Let them tell you exactly what they want. Give them the power to open themselves to marketing that feels right. They will accumulate a greater capacity for engaging ads by removing certain psychological blocks that seemingly arise during unsolicited marketing. Empowered marketing gives you an extra step forward to the mind by eliminating excess barriers. You do it a bit. Jump full in
"This app is about ads now. So basically everything FB touches turns it into personal advertisement app. It tracks my search history and keeps pushing ads thats tailored for me. I see an ad every 3 posts, this app is less than 1star and its a garbage app. I deleted fb and now its time to delete this trash too"
Add to story option unavailable. My account doesnt have the  add this to your story option. I am not able to share any public post to my story. My Instagram app is up to date. My other 2 accounts have the option available. My main personal account is the one that doesnt work. I have an iPhone. When logging into an Android my account has the option available. Please fix this
Privacy Concern. Tap on Following and Followers Remove SUGGESTED FOR YOUUnder ACTIVITY REMOVE SUGGESTED FOR YOU
steal your info. give you no privacy with the new update
"Getting worse constantly. Ive had multiple Instagram pages for a long time, it has always seemed to have issues with tagging people on a multiple post. Recently I deleted a business page and then after a month created a personal page, ever since Ive got it Ive had problems with it blocking my posts (hit report every time) or refusing to let me add tags (again reported everytime) Ive made several complaints, linked my Facebook to prove Im real etc but its still doing it, they cant seem to sort this issue but every day Im getting comments from spam bots or messages from fake accounts. Was way better before Facebook bought them"
Awful app. All privacy is lost this app went downhill when fb bought it
Please remove the suggest posts feature. Why do the users have to look at things that they didnt sign up to see? If that was the case then why did the app allows us to choose who to follow and not? This just take away the whole point of electing to chose whos posts to see if everyones post is just going to be put into the personal feed. I can understand ads in personal feed but putting other unfollowed peoples posts?????
"Reels are damaging society. Get rid of instagram reels. Theyre like a cheap version of TikTok mostly used by slime accounts, MLM moms, fake fitness influencers, and religious fanatics. Does no one else see the incredible, damaging, mind numbing impact that TikTok has had on our society? dont you think weve had enough of this endless scrolling? Instagram is trying to get you addicted to it once again by copying other social media platforms. And stop with this Shopping thing to make money off of exploiting teenage girls who feed into overconsumption and microtrends. Cant I have a place to share my pictures in peace, without this advertising, market scheming, addictive technology? Who is holding zuckerberg accountable for the detrimental impacts of all the bells and whistles on this thing? No one, thats what Im saying"
Instagram needs to be fixed. Before I go on Instagram my data will be working fine but as soon as I press Instagram it comes up with  no internet connection  and is not letting me see my messages and notifications. Also why do some people have purple / blue messages while some have grey
"Not loading and refreshing. Instagram is a great app and I've been using it since 2012 or 2013. But I'm having this issue where it says couldn't reload feed and no internet connection. I have never had that issue before. I cleared the cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled, logged out and logged back into my account, and I even turned my phone completely off and back on and it's still doing the same thing over and over again. I even updated it the other day and it's still giving me problems. And it started doing that to me ever since last night. I'm all out of options of what to do at this point. And it's not my data or anything because my telephone bill is always paid on time and I don't go through my data like that and my phone has a strong connection to data where I live so.... even my Messenger is messing up and it's like it's stuck on the title screen"
"Could not refresh feed. I don&#39;t know what the issue is but I keep getting &#34;couldn&#39;t refresh feed&#34; whenever I go to my profile or other people&#39;s profiles. Therefore, I cannot see their photos or my photos. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the app, tried going to my phone settings, turning off and on my data and it&#39;s still not working Very frustrating and it&#39;s been 2 days like this. Of course I have proper connection as I don&#39;t have any issues with any of my other apps"
"Profile info??. I cant update my profile info, change my picture, change name or bio since the last update"
"Issues. My DMs on my business account havent been able to load for over a week now. Instagram has literally ZERO support or help. Ive refreshed, deleted and reinstalled, logged in and out, restarted my phone. Nothing. Still cant access my DMs. Instagram is always glitching and messing up and no two accounts have the same features. What used to be a great app has gone to crap"
"Horrible Update and Deleted My Account Without Warning. Ive been using Instagram for years now and today when i opened the app it said that my account had been deactivated for violating community guidelines. They claimed that I was impersonating someone which is not true because it was my personal account and pictures of myself and friends. The support team has done nothing to help and I have tried so many ways to contact them and get help. The update has so many ads and just shows suggested instead of my friends thay I choose to follow. Instagram needs to fix this problem because i have so many friends who&#39;s accounts for deleted for no reason as well, give us back our accounts"
"Reporting. It doesnt matter how many times I report my impersonator, you guys dont do jack shit to help. Theyve texted multiple people in search of personal info and for nude photos and acted like they were me and you guys HAVENT EVEN LOOKED I can tell you havent even looked because all i get is an automated message saying theyve done nothing wrong well if they havent done anything wrong, then when i find who did it, ill have to do something wrong... you guys at instagram are ridiculously stupid"
"Sorry there was a problem with your request. Apparently you could be banned for not following the privacy policy &amp; the community guidelines, or they can mistakenly take your page away. Me, Im still not aware as to how I cant login my account. The way this error works is no matter how many times you change your password or attempt to login, it will forever argue Sorry there was a problem with your request. Now with this error it allows you to login online, however it will not let you login on the actual app. You could also login on another person&#39;s device. Instagram, please fix this error"
"Hacked. Hey IG... do better at your security measures I dont feel safe about my stuff if people can go in a hack, delete my messages and take my information"
. PLEASE get this because you liked. Crap OUT OF MY MAIN FEED I follow who I follow for a reason. I dont want all this extra stuff in my personal feed. This is so annoying. Every time I update this app I seriously regret it. You are destroying yourselves
Instagram notifications. Well for me everything works perfectly fine but the notifications wont pop up in my phone. I just think that theres a bug-fix they need to fix right away because someone can spam my phone in instagram with messages and I will not notice until I go in the app and check
deleting accounts. i love instagram but i have one big problem with it and its the fact that i cant delete second accounts and its so annoying and stressful and takes up my data so please instagram let my delete my account on the app itself and not some random webpage that doesnt work
Im crying. I live off of my income from my business Instagram page @gypsy_revolution. Suddenly my post werent being seen by my hashtags then slowing my followers audience got worse. No one is seeing my beautiful handcrafted art. NOW it happened to my regular personal account @gypsyglamoure. No one from my hashtags are seeing my post nor my followers. I have paid for two ads on @gypsy_revolution and it has not helped. Even my mom cant see my posts. PLEASE HELP Im broke and I dont know what to do
"Used to be WAY better. Instagram needs to learn to listen to its users. The opposite of wine; Instagram does not get better with time.  Its almost impressive how Instagram has made their app worse with literally each new update. From removing chronological order of post just so they can hire third party corporations to use their own algorithms (which takes your data and sells it), to now hiding the likes on posts from followers. And now they have a tiktok rip off called Reels that replaced the explore page and just plays u a 15s video, oh ya, and u have no choice of what the video is of, it just starts playing. Make Instagram 2016 again #zucsucks"
"Instagram wont let me leave. Yes Instagram is a good way to communicate with your friends and thats the only reason I use it, but lets not forget Instagram is a manipulative software that uses your data and sells it to big companies. And dont forget theres no privacy. Every second you spend on a post is timed and recorded. Every like, comment, message. Everything. Lately I was trying to delete an account of mine, when every time I typed in the password their software changed it to make it much longer. Instagram wont let me leave"
"Not personal anymore. Since this recent update, all I see is posts suggested for me, when all I want to see is posts from people I chose to follow. Im so uninterested in this format"
Incredible place to keep ur memories . Instagram is an incredibly safe place to keep ur memories in form of pictures and share the joy & love of life with everyone
"BLESSED BLESSED BLESSED. This Platform has been a great tool to every single one of us., from personal to business.. ITS AMAZING HOW INSTAGRAM HELPS US GROW"
Insta. I have multiple accs on insta and whenever I get a like on one acc it says its on others and its complicated to keep track what acc has been interacted with and its glitches out way to often since the new update
FUX THIS NOW. ive had instagram for 3 years and suddenly i went on it today it said no connection and since hasnt been working all day yet i am connected to my wifi ive tried my data and everything i even deleted that app and now it just wont let me login because have no connection yet i do
Acoout hacked and instagram comunity disabled it. Hey instagram We are with u from as a family from last 5 year. It ut seems like we care each other very good and i always accept ur norms/ law to keep safe our data.                                       But now unfortunately some one which i dont now hack my account and send unnecessary and 18+ content to my family and friends through my id. When my friend call me why u send these things than i notice that my instagram account which username is (@arjun__buttar) is hacked so than i wanna to recover my id but sone tym pass and notification come from ur side that ur account is disabled. So please instagram help me i want my account back as soon as possible and make instagram more secure and stronger from which hackers dont hack our id.  So please help me @instagram Thankyou for wonderful service u provide us from last many year 
"Deleted my account with out warning. They deleted my account without warning and now im unable to log back into it worse still, i have lost a lot of data from that account and instagram have been very unhelpful"
"updating problems. okay so i do love this app, i got my business and personal but i do not have any new updates it keeps not allowing me to do alot and it&#39;s annoying how instagram changed where the share posts are ._. like why? but the updates are becoming a problem to me"
"Was better before it started to work like Facebook. Now half the things dont even work, its slow and delayed. I cant even repost my business stories to my personal page... all the settings say its on but no dice. And I really need them to build a content scheduler into this. The drafts are great but sometimes I lose work when I set it up and then back out so it will save the draft"
"Share stories. I have 3 accounts, personal- business- art.On my personal one I cant share any stories even if Im tagged. I tried to reinstall the app and the same. On my business account I cant buy adds  and today I noticed that I dont have the option to post reels. I use an iPhone 11 Pro, so I dont think that the device is the problem. Same issues I have if I use Instagram from IPad or computer"
Amazing best app. Instagram is the best app its different tools are amazing for either personal or for a business account I would 100% recommend it to all my friends :)
Whats Going On. The ability to share the posts and content that I like from others stories is not available in either of my pages currently. I used to be able to do it from my personal page and now neither of my pages allows me. Im not sure why this feature has been taken away but isnt the point to share and interact with other people and now some of us cant do that? I just want to be able to use the app and all of its abilities. Also why cant music be played through all day 3 of the stories recorded and not just one?? This makes no sense
"Ever since the Nov 9 2020 app update, Ive had problems. Ever since the app update last night, I have had problems getting current IG info  I have deleted the app several times, rebooted my iPhone X many times and still have problems with my Instagram not updating my newsfeed or stories for those I subscribe to. Everything else on my phone is working just fine &amp; I have a ton of empty space on my phone. Help please"
Invasion of Privacy. New Terms of Service agreement is a horrible invasion of privacy. JP Sears makes a great parody video that outlines the worst offenses
"Stop spying on me Zuck. I like using insta, but using my phones microphone 24/7 and using my browser sessions to spam advertisements is creepy"
Cant post popular songs on my story . Instagram said  my business account had access to their personal music haha what a joke. Just count it as a stream and keep it pushing... Already switched to a personal account but its useless I still get the same warning //I can only use their stock songs. what is that?? 
"Goodbye Instagram. These latest and highly abusive terms of service going into effect 1/21 are too much to bear. I downloaded this app long enough to delete all my posts on both my personal and business accounts (you cannot, apparently, delete posts on desktop (I wonder why... c.f., JP Sears comedy video on Instagram)), and immediately deleted it as well as  deleting both accounts (which wont actually be deleted until after the new TOS take effect, hence the need to delete the posts. Congratulations, Facefail: You taint and corrupt everything you touch. Goodbye, Instagram"
Connection issue. App tells me couldn&#39;t refresh feed or no internet connection. Whether I&#39;m connected to wifi or data. Facebook and other apps work fine
no help. dont expect any help when your account gets hacked and your info is stolen. they dont care
"This app can offer incredible self empowerment resources if I seek it out and. Great for family pictures, and so many wonderful strangers helping others"
instagram crash. why is nothing loading when im connected to the wifi? i even checked with my data and nothing will load at all
:(. It worked fine until the update where it linked to Facebook now I cant change my profile picture or remove links on my info screen
"Cant log in. Somebody hacked into my Instagram account. They changed the email address and phone number. Now, it is impossible for me to log in even with logging into Facebook because it forces me to have another device approve it. But no device is logged so it cant. I hate this app. Until I get my account back, I will not give it a higher rating than a 1"
My account was hacked and theres no way to get it back. My account was hacked and stolen from me about a month ago and Ive sent multiple emails and complaints asking for ways to get it back . Send direct emails to Instagram and followed all the directions from the support page . I have not been contacted back at all . There should be a way to verify by me taking a video and doing somthing specific to get it back . If anyone knows how to get a stolen page back please help. Will rate higher if I can get a response and actually get my account back
Broken app. You guys app keep telling me that yall are limiting my activity to protect the community when I havent done anything. I went to the help center and got no feed back. I cant like any pictures and I cant see any pictures as well. Ive had my account for 6 days and Ive already been basically kicked from the app because at this point its no reason to be on it
Privacy story setting. I love the app. Just need to improve the setting system in privacy section for story. You can give an option for all where it hides from everyone so people dont have to go one by one and hide/unhide. Cause it gives an error after doing it for like 300 times
"Data stealing app with too many ads. Used to be fun app now its a psychotic time stealing, data stealing, surveillance software. So sad. And far too many ads. Do better"
awesome. ive been using instagram for 5 years now and i would like to say ive always loved the app. I have a main instagram with everyone i know where i am able to post cute pictures that i love. and i have a spam account where i can share my thoughts and feelings with funny pictures and videos and since instagram has a private feature i can use that so only my close friends can see it . instagram is a great way of communication as well and you can always meet new people  overall i suggest you get instagram its a fun social media platform 
Zero privacy. Horrible service zero privacy
Hackers. My account has been hacked and they are still using the account there is no security that protects you from this yet they have broken all privacy and intellectual property rights. This issue needs to be resolved. Imagine a platform that doesnt secure your details THINK
"terrible image quality. facebook is the richest social media platform and makes 94% of its money off selling our data to advertisers but when i upload a photo taken on my full frame mirrorless camera they look like they came out of a flip phone because the image quality gets SO watered down. why?? yall have tons of money. just post our images at their real quality. i made sure the images are 1080 pixels and it still looks awful, its like yall are also decreasing the number of colors??? ugh i hate it. so much.ugh. someone PLEASE make a new photo sharing app.also reels are stupid, stop trying to make it a thing. stop copying every single app UGH I HATE FACEBOOK for ruining this app. no wonder the founders quit"
Its awesome. I love instagram because you can edit your photos add lighting filters and funny and cute filters it makes sure you have privacy and it can entertain you for hours
My spam. Instagram is a good app but my notifications wont come  &amp; my account keeps saying couldnt refresh feed  i love instagram but this needs to get fixed ASAP
Addictive app. Collects your data and very addictive app
"Owned by face book and a number of breaches. Had this app for a while and noticed I massive amount of ads which are surpringly tailored to anything I like or post which is disgusting. I am really annoyed by this but what made me rate this app one star is the fact that I have had my private information leaked and ads tailored to all of my private life which I find is filthy, they are making profit of selling my information which is horrible"
Hackers. Stop all sharing tracking etc
No customer support. My account was hacked and I havent received a single email back from support to get it back. The hacker is posting spam stories and post under my account as me along with direct messaging my followers. Its been over a week and Instagram has given no sign that they have even reviewed my issue
No support. Suddenly I cant tag people in a picture.  I noticed this in both my personal and company accounts.  I cant get any explanation or help from IG
"Unable to access account. So my account is saying their is some unusual activity on my account. So its logged me out and is requiring a verification code that is meant to be sent to my phone Ive been trying for over an hour and nothing, I can not get in contact with Instagram and my friends have looked up my account and everything is deleted. Please help"
Disappointed. Privacy and censorship concerns
Phishing. Someone hacked my account changed my email and mobile number Instagram let them i got it back they took it back over and now i cant get it back service is horrible your privacy invasion is horrendous Instagram do nothing do not post anything with them
Able to add to highlights without having to post on our story first. Us as Instagramers should be able to add videos and pictures to our story without having to spam and bombarded our story and viewers. Easier access to posting highlights would be appreciated
"Instagram bug. For some reason I got logged out of my account. I tried to get in using my password and for some reason it didnt let me and even tho I changed the back up email and phone number it still shows up the one I had 10 years ago that I no longer use of have access to, the support page does not help in any of the questions and you are telling me that a multi million dollar company cannot invest into helping their customers into gaining access to their account?, like, all that information and that account that is me I can prove it, lost. And nobody can get access to it?, not even instagram itself, Ive tried to reach out to support and it is still telling me that there is nothing to be done. What am I supposed to go from here?"
"New Update is not user friendly :(. The new update showed me that Instagrams priorities are in making money and put very little care into the simplest details which made Instagram so user friendly in the past. Instead of being able to post or see notifications with one click, those buttons have been moved to a separate page and have been replaced with money grabbers The notifications tab is now shopping which literally who is going to use that. The post button is now reels which is basically a worse version of tik tok. This app has become less for creating content and more for consumption. Disappointing, this has been my favorite app for years"
"If you get hacked you account its gone. They should make it easier to get your account back if you get hacked or a phone number we can talk to real human, its very frustrating"
"Instagram load slow. Hello, What is happening? everytime my wifi is on instagram is slow but when i use my data instagram is normal. What is happening? Please fix this problem ASAP because my instagram is slow with wifi on"
"PLEASE PLEASE HELP. Hi,Please read this as I have no other way of informing FaceBook.On Monday 17th of August My Facebook and Ad manager account which I use for my business was hacked and was then used to create ads which had no relation my business. This then resulted in me being charged around £762 for an advert which I had no knowledge about. As I tried to report the issue to Facebook the hacker then changed my profile and cover to images which go against your community guidelines which then resulted in my account being instantly disabled. The whole situation has been very distressing as I have now lost both my personal Facebook and Instagram Business account for my brand which I have been building for over 5 years.I have evidence of the ad that was ran on my ad manager account and can provide any information you require about my business. I have also reported this as a fraud case to my local police (Thames Valley Police) who have given me a crime reference number. Please please could you help me with regaining access to my business account and understanding how this could have happened.Regards,"
Stolen identity. My old account was hacked and even tho all my friends have reported that account and me as not being me. Instagram refuses to take it down. Disappointing
stop spying on us. Stop spying on us
This update is horrible. I have 5 business accounts and my personal. Out of no where it just switches to all accounts.It goes nutsThe fb messenger thing is horrible too. I use to have all Facebook accounts connected to the Instagram accounts now it connects one but disconnects the others Hope this is fixed soon
"Lost all posts. Ive reactivated my Instagram account after taking a break for a while. On reactivating, I lost all my old posts. The help centre clearly states that no data will be lost on deactivation. Ive tried to contact the app support multiple times and reported this issue several times on the app too but no response. Terrible customer service from a company like this"
"1- Impersonation problem not addressed for months 2- TERRIBLE for business accounts. Ive been having Instagram for personal use for a long time, but since a couple of months ago, things started to go downhill FAST. First - Every single promotion I create in my business account says its approved, and still is not shown to ONE person. Ive already checked every single thing that I could be doing wrong, but theres absolutely nothing wrong. Great quality photo, right size, right content, insta page connected to the Facebook page, you name it. And that wouldve been ok, if it wasnt for the drastic change in the algorithms, which have been showing my page to its followers every day less and less. The only way to get engagement is by paying them to run ads, and even when you do it, they do not work... such a disappointment Second issue - someone created a fake account of my personal page and HAS BIKINI photos, promising pornographic videos as if it is me, and even though Ive already reached out to Instagram MULTIPLE times, and have about 100 friends who have reported the fake account, after 2 months ITS STILL THERE And following every single male in my personal account. The account uses the exact same profile photo & bio as mine, and has blocked me so I cant see it.  but I can see it through my business account.Instagram hasnt responded to any of my attempts to fix things for months"
Verification code. I love Instagram I really do but today it asked me to confirm my number and I really didnt think anything of it so I put my number and when it asked me the verification code it still hadnt sent it to me so I waited but nothing happened so I asked  for a new verification code and that one didnt send either so I went to settings and when I went to look at my personal information nothing would load and it wasnt a problem with my internet and now it has been two hours and I cant do anything on is nothing is loading and I cant see anything
What the heck. Why is the post option in the same page as stories Absolutely unnecessary and a hassle Its almost like you want to people to use features your company likes onlyUpdate notifications are garbage now and dumpster fire of confusion Can access the supposed notifications in my account
"My daughters account hacked and getting blackmailed. We have tried to get in touch with Instagram for nearly 3 weeks on Twitter Facebook and Instagram,as my daughters account t has been hacked and she is getting blackmailed for euros to get her account back or they will sell it . I am so disappointed that no one had replied to our numerous of reports"
"Good, but. I wish there was a feature that blocked out unnecessary nudity from ones personal feed and explore page"
its ok but. posting stories/actually using the app racks up so much extra documents and data that i have to constantly uninstall and reinstaill because it makes my phone run out of memory
"ONE LAST SUGGESTION PLEASE. As someone who switched over to VSCO and I hope only temporarily, I have one last suggestion. The reason I left Instagram is because I found something better for my needs. I needed an app where I can share my life and have as much privacy as I can have. I am glad that you now have an option to hide people who liked ones posts and turn off comments, but one last thing please- an option to hide followers and followings from everyone, much like how one can hide friends on Facebook. If this becomes an option, I will be back. I promise. And I bet individuals who have the same needs would be drawn to Instagram as well. I hold the view that having options/flexibility just brings in more people, in general. So thank you for listening to us and giving us more control"
why are u turning ig into a store. these new updates are SO BAD Im sorry but you cannot make the amount of changes you did and not expect people to be upset. Its disappointing and kind of messed up that you are pushing users to buy stuff this blatantly like I get Facebook bought it and thats what fb likes to do but come on. This platform is going to turn into something people dont use (just like fb turned into) if you keep on this track
Lack of privacy guidance. I seem to be followed by strangers and I dont know how to lose them
Fix it. Am I the only one whos having trouble trying to update their bio and profile photo. It keeps saying that I need to make sure I have internet connection and closing the app when Im streaming straight from my data
Privacy Violations. The amount of things this app has access to on your phone and your computer/laptop(if you use this app on those devices) even if theyre password protected is insane. Best build your platform on something else that doesnt violate your privacy to this apps level
"Something is wrong with my Instagram. I am sooo disappointed as Im having an issue with my personal Instagram page but cant find any way to contact someone to get any resolution. From my business account, when I attempt to search for my personal account it almost appears as if Im blocked showing a follow button but saying 0 post. The issue has brought to my attention that several of my friends (close) cant see my profile either stating the same thing.. PLEASE HELP I utilize this account as an influencer and for my podcast"
"Impersonation station. One of the biggest trends on IG at the moment is impersonation -people taking advantage of business owners and content creators who put their heart into their craft by stealing their faces, names (with slightly different username spelling), and content with the intent of stealing money from the main acocunts followers. This is happening in quite a few online niches, but spiritual IG is where Ive noticed it most common. People will steal a hardworking business owners pictures and reach out to their followers offering them readings for a certain price -taking a healing practice and using it to steal from already broken people. Its sick. It would be one thing if this was just happening, but its been going on for MONTHS at this point. Ive had at least 8 or 9 impersonators, but I know some bigger accounts who have had hundreds. Most of the impersonators I report never get removed, so they just erase the content and move onto the next content creator. If IG wants to be seriously considered for professionals or for e-commerce, they HAVE to step their game up to protect business owners and content creators. Its incredibly hard to grow ones brand as a business account when my follower list is be predatorily targeted by someone using my face and name. Make blue verification checks easier to get, improve account reporting function, make it harder for scam accounts to use the app, anything that will actually make a difference"
"Lots of Bugs. Maybe they just need to release an update, but there are multiple bugs that have been missed through recent updates. Volume can be up on phone, but if you go to view someones video or reel the sound dont play even when you click for the volume on in it. It is now no longer tracking link history. Have notifications on for someone? Better hope thats the only one that you get because when you click the notification to check it, EVERY SINGLE OTHER NOTIFICATION FROM IF ACCOUNTS GOES AWAY. The app itself is not terrible, but these are super obnoxious bugs that need to be fixed. I have the latest iPhone, latest iOS, and latest update to Instagram so this is nothing on my end at all. All them"
"connecting to friends. STOP CONNECTING ME TO MY FRIENDS. IF I WANTED TO FOLLOW THEM I WOULD HAVE you do not need to send out a mass next about an account i made its an invasion of privacy and its unnecessary. if i want my friends and contacts to follow me, ill tell them the account. stop doing this"
"Dont Download. Do not download this weak app you will not like it at all and thy save some of your photos for there use and thats a fact so 9 times out of 10 thy have some of your photos and selling without you knowing, you may see your photos on walls and pages and you try and think what you did but its not you its IG and Facebook selling your photos to 3rd party people"
"UNFOLLOWING PROCESS. As much as I love using Instagram, you guys need to incorporate a way for us to mass unfollow people. Also an easier way to see if someone is following back or not than having to click their page and look at their followers. I usually use third-party apps for these tasks but I guess EVERYONE is too good to allow third party apps to access their apps now. As a result of that you guys locked my account which was stupid because no one is trying to buy followers or hack anything, I just simply want to be able to unfollow multiple people at once who arent following me"
"Account Hacked. In case this happens to someone else: My Instagram Account was Hacked. The sender used a name I was familiar with. It was not that person. They gave me a phone number to call to get a Service to start a business. I was to call this number immediately. This person said they got $300,000.00 to start their business"
"Safety Problems. I feel as if I cant do anything on Instagram with out feeling unsafe. Every once in a while someone tries to hack into my account. It scared me because just today I had to change my password AGAIN. There are also so many spam things that you let into your app. And whenever Im in the process of changing my password, all I have to do is log back into my account but I dont know if its a spam. Please find different ways to make Instagram safe. It would be a shame if I had to delete it"
"Locked out if account after attempted hack into my phone. Cant get no help from Instagram period. They even have my ID on file ... clearly not a bod... ticket after ticket, nothing"
"Problem unsolved. Ive reported this issue several times and its still not solved. I cant log into different accounts, I add all my data and it simply doesnt show up. I cant change my profile picture, every time I try, it says Im not connected to wifi even if I am. I cant change my bio and I cant change my website, every time I try, I get unknown server error. Ive deleted the app more than once, restarted my phone, and the problem continues. Its frustrating because theres no other way to contact Instagram besides reporting the problem so I dont know if theyre actually doing something to fix this"
notifications. this app will completely disregard the settings u choose and spam u with notifications whenever any nobody wants to go live 
"Post orders, ads,recommend accounts. Hate the view older post feature just let me scroll down to older post in order, and hate the amount of ads now its getting annoying every other story is an ad or recommend account makes me want to close the app, no option to stop auto play videos is draining my data I cant even use this app much anymore I have 10gb of data and its using it all even with the use less data setting on"
I had my account hacked. A couple of days ago someone logged in and changed the email and password to my Instagram account. I have reported and replaced my Instagram account and I have filed WITH INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK to help me get my account back and they have denied to help me I have emailed and called multiple times to show the urgency of my situation and still no response from Facebook now a lot of my friends have been hacked too Instagram has got to start answering and helping those of us that can provide the original Information to our accounts
My account melg2021 was taken over. My account was hacked and taken over a few days ago. I had around 2000 followers. I reported a man that was stalking me and blocked him. This man is stalking me on the platform that I reported. Please remove his Instagram account. He is the one that was impersonating a bigger nice woman and really is a sick man  He is a horrible individual and then looked up my information and was calling my Real Estate Business line. We cant allow these sick people to be on here if we can catch them. He is a felon he snapped his IDI believe its in the chat Thank youMelissa GrayMel G
"New update is horrible, makes me want to delete app. I love using Instagram to keep up with family and friends but all of these new updates are absolutely terrible. They make it so difficult to navigate the app. To start, they got rid of the activity tab so I can no longer see who likes my pictures/follows me easily. They replaced this with some sort of marketplace (which I will never be utilizing). Furthermore, they also got rid of the explore and search page and replaced it with a reel function, which is basically a replica of tik tok (again another thing I will never be using). In order to see my activity or even just search an accounts name, I had to look around on the app for quite some time before finding a tiny little icon for these things on my main feed. To top it all off, they introduced the feature that says youre all caught up. see older posts, which prevents me from seeing 80% of my followings content. I am very disappointed with these changes and see myself heavily reducing my usage of this app in the near future due to its overly complicated layout and useless new features"
"Instagram is not a shopping app. Instagram was created to share photos. How is having a shopping tab adding to this photo sharing experience? You guys have decided to forget about your users and instead sold the app, the users, and their data, to algorithms to target our pockets and to gain ad revenue. This is disgusting. Return the app to the way it was"
Hacked. My Instagram account has been hacked for a week now I am trying to get it back Instagram help center need to do better because they dont have a phone number for you to call them this really bad
my account got hacked. someone hacked my account and instagram has been absolutely no help
"Poor Customer Service. Customer service is nonexistent. My account got disabled and then deleted on the same day for no apparent reason . I suspected it was hacked so emailed the phishing support contact provided on Instagram help. Every day , for 23 days, I sent emails , placed phone calls and left voice mails , and to this day I have not gotten any response God forbid you have thousands of followers and this happens to you. Extremely disappointed Instagram , Dont advertise your support email and phone number as you simply dont have a customer service center"
"Old Instagram. I miss the way Instagram used to be, a few years ago, it was my relief from Facebook. No ads, just my friends and familys posts. Now I barely see my personal posts, its all ads. I try to hide them etc, but does no good. I get that all companies need to make money, but Instagram is feeling more and more like Facebook every day, which makes me sad and frustrated"
"Will not let me share posts to stories. I can share just fine on my other account, but not on my business account. I have exhausted all my options. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling, turning off and on my phone, updating to the latest version, clearing my cache, playing with the toggle button for resharing in the privacy setting, making sure the profile Im trying to share is not private, logging into a different phone and trying from my account. It is extremely frustrating and Ive sent in about 20 inquiries to Instagram about troubleshooting and have received NOTHING from anyone. Is there anyone that can help me with this issue?"
What happened. Instagram and Facebook are slowly just getting worse and worse... I no longer see my friends or popular post. Just adds last time I was on Instagram I saw 15 adds in a row not one personal post just adds If this continues Im out of here
Hacked. Downloaded app on new device which does not have camera or microphone enabled this being a third party app hacked and enabled those features secretly but device notice icon alerted me to the hack. Please be careful with this as kids use Instagram
Bruh. Your new updates are literal invasions of privacy
Stop listening to us. Would love this platform if it wasnt listening/recording your conversation and then serving your ads based on what it heard
"Option missing on the app. While everyone has Resharing story option available, on my privacy settings its not there due to which people I mention in my story cannot add in their story, people cannot share my story even after their mentions in mine. So disappointing. My app is the most updated version still see a bug"
"Hacked account. Somebody hacked my personal account and Instagram didnt do anything to verify if that me who banned my own account. And now there is nothing that I can do to get it back and the hacker is threatening me with this account and asking for money if I want to get it back, I have the evidence of this person but Instagram doesnt do anything"
Instagram auto disabled accounts for no reason. Instagram has a tendency to auto disable accounts for no reason and sometimes you have to wait weeks or even months to get it back through the most tedious and inconvenient process I have ever experienced. Instagram makes millions of dollars off ad revenues and our data and yet they offer no customer support or email support. This app truly is the glorification of post capitalism in an app. VERY BAD WAY TO TREAT YOUR USERS
"Suggested posts. For some reason my feed says Im caught up on the last 3 days of posts, but when I click older posts I see thing from hours to a day ago that were never in my feed. I also dislike the suggested posts feature, it feels like Instagram has forced an explore page onto our personal feeds"
"The epitome of evil. They work very very hard to keep your children brainwashed and stuck on their phones for hours, all of social media has downgraded a whole generation, thats why nowadays people say they sold their soul to be famous because kids have an obsession with what they are taught as cool, this app and others take what they are teaching kids and amplify it and shove it down your childs throat constantly while they spy on their information searches and microphones so they find the right type of business to advertise towards your children. Im convinced as a 20 year old man that technology is going to have WAY more bad side affects than benefits"
"Whack. My explore page is full of stuff trending in my country instead of stuff that I like, its a pathetic attempt to make me click on reels as that is literally the only entertaining thing on there. Reels shown or featured are boring and cringey, whats the point of collecting my data if youre not gonna use it bruh"
Trouble on there. You let too many people on there who use celebritys names to scam people. The app has become not safe anymore. And the privacy does not work. People can still follow you who you do not know. There are too many fake people on there who say their someone and there not. You need to fix it to make it safe so peoples names are not being used
Chris. I so much appreciate this app for its safety and privacy
so i got hacked. there is this thingy thats going on and its where you get this insta notification and it send it to everyone and ya
I hate Facebook. Serotonin mining is getting out of hand. The ai algorithms are working too well at keeping phones in our hands. Put your phone down and have a conversation. 1 star
FIX YOUR SPAM FILTER. My brand is called @blade.us AND I CANT tag my brand in my bio on my personal page because INSTAGRAM marks it as spam. It says challenge required. started happening with the new update. Had no problems prior. Really frustrating was locked out of my account for a week until I realized what the issue was
Love the amount of likes privacy update. Great update will detract people from feeing self conscious about the amount of likes them and others get
Why cant I get my notifications. I reset my phone re downloaded the app singed out checked settings on my phone and on Instagram. Anyway yall can help
"Ruined by new update. Notifications should be put back where it used to be so its easy to access. The shopping bit can be moved to where notifications has been put if we MUST have a shopping section. But instagram is for sharing photos and connecting with friends, not shopping so it should not take priority over the notifications button. Reels is unnecessary, just let tiktok be its own app and try making something original for instagram if you need something new"
Mad. Instagram is very rude asking for my personal info not my username and password my personal info
No Good. Let this app go it is of no good they are using you and made lots of cash off you and still they are stealing your data and on let the app go youll be happy you did
"Keeps locking my accounts. Basically, these past few days Instagram keeps locking my accounts for no reason, and I cant seem to access them without using my old phones number (which I dont have) so I want to know why you keep logging me out, but apart from that I do love Instagram, and hope this doesnt happen again, ty :)"
"Security Does Not Help. I was hacked two weeks ago. I have no control or access to my account anymore. The hackers are targeting all of my friends and some of them have been hacked as well. There is no phone number for IG and they do not respond to email which is disgraceful. More accounts are being hacked now from my account and these issues will keep happening unless the security team starts responding to emails. Very disappointed. With millions of users on IG, youd think theyd employ more people to keep your account secure"
"App quality declining. New redesign emphasizes all of the worst of stores of insta. App no longer shows posts from people I follow, and the shop and reels at the bottom replace the features I use. Already removed Facebook app because company only cares about unethical data mining. Great job losing another user"
Scam. I love Instagram. But the only problem I have is getting help. My personal account @lupe_chacon_rightmyer_ was hacked. I have been trying to get help but who do you call. The directions are not clear. Im dyslexic and ADHD that makes complicating for me. Some of my followers got hacked as well because of my account. I hope someone can reach out to me other than that I truly love Instagram no drama except when it comes to hackers. I just wish Instagram would take hackers seriously because now they have private information of mine I lost all my pictures of my family and its just heartbreaking. Please have a better customer service
"Instagram was never supposed to be an online shopping center. This new update has everyone I know turning away from this once amazing app. It is now making it so much more difficult to post pictures, view my likes and comments, and talk to my friends, which is what I thought was the point of instagram in the first place. With more of these continuous unnecessary updates, people are going to stop using this app more than ever"
No HD streaming for reels on Cellular Data. Sad to see instagram with no HD option turn on for Cellular data .. Looking forward for this option
Removing profiles. I really like instagram and its my best app but in 2020 in arabs instagram we have groups that remove profile for no reasons and hack profiles and some go and take all the profile messages and private things that is to annoying and i wish that instagram can stop these things and remove only the profile that should be removed
Love Instagram BUT. I always getting blocked from liking pictures or following back my friends On my personal and photoshoot page I get blocked says Im using an APP which Im NOT  And now I have to wait a wait to like pics or follow any of my friends back please fix your system
"Highly disappointed. I am a new time user to Instagram. I have had the app for maybe a week and it has already gotten hacked into. I have already set up the two-step verification system, and have a private account. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of security Instagram has provided. I am not sure what else there is to do but delete my account to prevent this from happening in the future. My privacy is important to me and should be to you too. In NO other app has this ever happened to me"
So disappointed. It is clear that the not interested option on the suggested posts just means you will get more of those posts. My feed is littered with the same suggestions that I have stated Im not interested in over and over again. I am very close to closing down my account as are many others that I know. It is sad because it was a nice way to share updates during Covid without the drama of Facebook. This has basically turned me off the first and only personal social media that Ive used
"Do better. The account natbragg._ was stolen from me. I was hacked and they changed the email, phone number, and username associated with the account. Instagram has no way for me to contact any support to get it back. It says to submit a claim but that is not possible. Someone has all my posts and pictures of me, not acceptable. Give me a way to reclaim my account"
Spies on you - its in the terms. Spies on you via your camera. Read new terms. Perverts
"Bot-pocalypse. There are boys everywhere on Instagram, and scams galore. If youre not savvy enough to know a scam when you see one, please do not install; two frequent scams include getting someone to click a link in a story soliciting adult images, and the other one I see most frequently is from people claiming to be entrepreneurs and stock market masters who can help you get rich very quickly. 1) anyone who promises you can get super rich super quick is either lying to themselves or intentionally deceiving you. 2) never EVER give out your personal information online, dont write a check to anyone you dont know, never pay someone who is asking for money in the form of gift cards (theyre not traceable) and never assume you know who you are talking to UNLESS you actually know them in real life. If someone is claiming to be some kind of government agent, and then ask for your information (whats your name, where do you live, SSN, etc) then they definitely are not from the government. Just please be careful until Instagram starts doing better and moderating bots and scams"
"Very disappointed . My actions are blocked on several accounts as I use them from same phone, although one of if my personal account and barely had any actions on it, that one got limited for a week with others as well. It supposed to expire after a week, but even the date they have promised has passed and I still not able to use my account It is way too annoying. Not suits instagram. I dont get any response whatsoever either, even though I probably sent more than a dozen feedback. Very disappointing"
"The system. Good afternoon; I feel like many accounts that have a massive following get away with many things, which isn&#39;t fair. I was hacked about two months still haven&#39;t gotta back my Facebook or the accounts that are linked to that account. Those accounts were my source of income during this pandemic. I sent my info to get my account and still nothing"
Loved. Data
HACKED. Im really careful about my privacy on social media but my account got hacked and so did my second one
"Discriminates and bans certain Americans. From security and privacy Breeches to fake fact check scamming to discriminate against normal and innocent Americans, this company is discriminatory and uses their platform to promote lies and crimes against humanity. Wont last long"
"New Update. I was really happy with Instagram until the last update. Moving shopping and reels to the places where activity and new post used to be just seems like a way to grab money from its users, and as someone who has never bought anything from Insta shops before or used reels, its incredible annoying having the two parts I used the most moved to the corner of the screen while the shopping and reels tabs take their place"
"New updates dont come on my personal account. I have two accounts on Instagram and ones personal and the other one is just a spam account. The spam account seems to get all the new updates and new fonts for insta stories Whereas, my personal account never updates I still have the same old fonts that I hate and my personal account is always lagging. Ive tried deleting the app and downloading it again yet it remains the same"
Hey. Instagram is the best app ever I love the app nothing has happened but because I actually deleted of my phone for something my business and when I try to download it back its not letting me but Instagram is the best app ever live it
"This is ridiculous. Ive been on instagram for a few years now and one day my instagram just stopped working. Ive tried to get it back by sending reports, changing my password, etc. Nothing works. Ive also uninstalled &amp; reinstalled the app and i have to same out come each time. Every time i try and log in, it gives a message saying error there was problem with your request. All i want at this point is to log into my instagram and get all the pictures ive posted back. Ive also tried to make various accounts to see if my account was the problem but it always says the same thing. This only happens when on my phone. Ive successfully logged into my account through friends phone &amp; on my laptop. I am out of words at this point, because this had gone on far to long"
"IM STILL WAITING FOR A REPLY. this is now my 7th time reaching out to the Instagram support team and will evidently be my last. After numerous requests, Instagram still has yet to address the numerous issues wrong with my account including my inability to like, comment, make captions, and follow back. Although the may seem like minor issues, I have repeatedly reached out via email, report systems and reviews in pursuits of fixing the situation. Yet, I have not had any luck, nor have I even heard back from anybody on the support team. Instagram is my top resource for all my personal and business social needs, however, with the constant bugs and my blocked account, my accounts are now useless, forcing me to retrain myself and my staff how to use competitor apps such as twitter and Pinterest. Please help me update and fix my account"
"HACKING CHAIN GOING ON PEOPLES ACCOUNTS ARE AT RISK. A bunch of people on this app are at HUGE risk. There is this chain of hacking going on and peoples accounts are getting hacked causing it to appear that they have dmd and commented on so many accounts pages hey i have something to tell you check your dms and those hackers made it so that when you click the link that they send you you get hacked too I am so worried for me and my friends safety and i took the steps to change my password and set my account to two step verification. I hope you take this seriously everyones accounts have been hacked and its spreading VERY quickly. The link has like a title saying i made this out of your photos to make people click it and be curious. there is no thing that asks for your login info you just enter it and you get hacked. Exactly what happened to me. you can ignore this instagram but i need to warn you guys that it got sent to over hundreds of my followers and now theyre going to be hacked and then their followers and then so on. I REALLY hope you guys can do something to fix this because about half the people i know (including myself) have been hacked and i am not a fan of waking up to 300 UNREAD dms thanks,sawsane salhi@sawseysane"
"With every new update it gets worse. Considering deleting the app at this point. Not an app for your friends posts anymore but rather for you to mindlessly scroll for hours without even coming across any decent content. Taking out chronological order was a mistake, putting the explore feed into my personal feed was an even bigger mistake and constantly changing the layout of activity and dms every update was a mistake. Every other social media with the exception, maybe, of facebook, is doing this better"
Insta Messaging. I have not been able to load my message screen for a week or more and it is very frustrating because I can see that people are sending me things but nothing is loading. The messaging works on my account for my business but not personal and no updates are doing anything
Hacked. Not feeling safe when Im hacked cant see my own account. Someone says Im selling porn posts makes stories and sends them to all my followers. Its taking a while to respond to this Instagram I dont feel safe
"Problem. I love Instagram. Im having a problem with my business account that I dont have the option to add music to my story, but in my personal account its still there. Tried many ways to get it back but nothing work. If you coul solve the problem please. Thank you"
"Temporarily Locked Out. Have been removed from my account and I dont have access to the email I used to set up the account, no support email to reach out to and no way of accessing my old email. Looks like Im not going to be able to log back in, had the account for 7 years and will lose all the photos. Really disappointed in the lack of support from Instagram on this"
"Instagram features. Overall fairly happy with my 2 accounts I would really like to have all the features on both accounts of mine  I dont ...My main account which is an creator account has more audience &amp; followers does not have REELS option  My other personal account DOES have that option why? Its very frustrating  Please advise on how to fix it for tishas.beauty.bar  account I dont need it really for other account but should have on both Kindly, Tisha Simmons"
Too many ads. Super annoying. Collecting my data and too many ads
I need help. I need help my Instagram is not working for some reason everytime i log into my Instagram it says cant refresh feed. Nothing on my Instagram loads my mesages my posts nothing I dont know how to fix it at all when i log into other accounts it works just fine it just doesnt work with my account nothing pops up. I have wifi on and my cellular data it still doesnt work. I have turned my phone off and reinstalled the app and it doesnt work. I have logged in on another device and it still doesnt work at all for me. I need help
"We need real customer support. Ive been on Instagram since 2013 and its always been fun for me until this year. This year I created a page for my son (who is now one), which got hacked when it reached 10,000 followers. The hacker harassed me and held my sons page for ransom. I contacted IG support at least 50 times and reported my sons page and the hackers page to get them taken down. its been 2 weeks and I havent heard anything back while some psychopath is using my sons page to lure in the pages of other peoples children to hack them as well. Yes all babies Instagram pages are run by adults, but they dont know that some possible creep is trying to hack them and use their childrens pages for followers. I feel like if Instagram can pay for Kylie Jenner to post revealing pictures of herself, they can pay for actual customer support Instagram is always blocking people for liking too many posts or viewing too many profiles, but when it comes to actual problems they turn their heads"
No Freedom or privacy in this app. Shame on such a big app to delete anything related to the real truth Free Palestine
Censors into. Censors info
Slowly becoming a NO. I have to un install the app like 4 times this months because it makes my phone overhear to the point it blanks out everyones I use Instagram it eats up the data on my phone and makes my iPhone overheat that needs to be fixed immediately
"Instagram is dead. Ads galore, horrendous algorithms, poor design, and unnecessary features. I have been using Instagram consistently since 2010 or 2011 and I used to love it. It actually made my feel inspired and more connected to others until maybe 5 or so years ago. but Ive deleted the app for good and I plan to deactivate by the end of the year. This app is terrible for ones mental health and it siphons our data and takes advantage of our free labor and ad views. It is designed to be addictive and make us question our worthiness. The app makes billions off of our addict usage, yet only continues to make it worse and more maddening for its users. Do yourself a favor and get out of the abusive relationship you have with this app and website. Delete the app, then make a plan to log off for good"
Scamming. Shadow banning whats the point of hashtags if you hide them .Also wheres my data request .obudsman
Making adjustments. Instagram should let ppl pin conversations so dont have to bother scrolling all the way down just to text someone  but after all Instagram is a very great app and I hope it never goes away 
Hacked and account stolen with no help. I loved using Instagram and all its features but recently I received a message from a a friend I thought and as soon I clicked link I was locked out of account all my user information was changed and yes bad on me for clicking link but I had no idea link was bad. Also yes I got emailed the my info was be changed and tried to stop by the sims link sent by Instagram but it did nothing. Now I getting now replies back from Instagram and new user is posting false information on my page. Please help me get my account back
Account information. Its too easy to get your account hacked it just happened to me last night and I made another one and now the new one is tweaking out also. So I insisted on not downloading this app
Instagram new algorithm. No personal account gets any likes any more on posts. I usually get about 500 views on my story. And now it dropped to 100 over a span of 12 hours. Not one story post got over 112. This has NEVER happened to me before. Its absolutely horrible for everyone. Whenever I post something- I get hardly any likes. I used to get about 270. Then I gained about 500 followers and now I get 350 if Im LUCKY. I dont know what Instagram did but it absolutely ruined my account. Every person I know also complains about this. If this is algorithm - its a horrible update. If u want a way to make teenagers self conscious- this is it. To drop their likes and views. Social media already pressured us and here is Instagram making it worse. Ill tell you right now. This is not fair in any way to those of us who do not have business accounts. We have personal accounts and this algorithm is not helping at all. Everyone I know is ready to delete and leave Instagram and I might myself. This is unacceptable. I have reported this issue about 7 previous times to no avail.
"Messages and usernames. Please change the message settings back to usernames. I go in my messages and dont know who anyone is based on their name in their bio because why would I have that memorized?? And then when you have conversations with 5 Allies and 6 Jessicas, its too hard to keep track, and the profile photos are too small to actually differentiate profiles without clicking on them. This is already proving to be a major inconvenience, and it just changed today "
Instagram. Stop following. Tracking manipulating.?.. maybe.??.. Stop Now. Dont be a BULLYY
"Account hacked and no customer support. So my account was hacked and the hacker changed me email, phone number and password. Therefore, making it impossible for me to get into my account. The bigger issue that I have is that there is no support from Instagram. Ive tried googling ways on how to contact Instagram and on how to recover my account with no luck. Ive tried to find an email or a phone number to contact to report my issue, but nothing exists out there. Now the hacker has my account, information, stole money from me, and now is trying to scam my followers. Instagram support and security is very poor and is causing me a lot of stress"
IT DOESNT EVEN LET ME USE THE APP. Hey Instagram I cant log in to the app I think its my phone how can I fix it I cant log into my iPad but not on my phone
"Too many adverts poor ux. Its a shame this platform is overcome with adverts. I get a feed advert every 4th post, mostly irrelevant - contact lenses/glasses despite not using any, adverts for parenting (god forbid). Uses FB ad data but none of the selective user interactions (eg. Dont show alcohol/gambling ads). Really lets the app down.The latest update shifted the most commonly used functions into the hardest to reach area of a screen. Posting a story is no longer intuitive. Whos bright idea was it to stick the Instagram logo top left and replace the activity icon with a shopping icon?"
Bad Cant see pictures of people you follow. Your new view suggested posts is not good What is the point of the search section if youre going to put it on my personal feed I can only see the 5 same accounts every day on my feed because of your algorithm of not letting me see ALLL the people Im following posts based on the time that they posted but now I literally can only see 2 of the accounts I follow when it tells me Ive seen all my friends accounts (which is 10000% false) then it tells me to look at strangers posts
"Uhmmm. Why is it showing ppl i dont even follow and the ones i do follow i can never see their post .... like come on and i have message i can see put it shows i have some  Come on with this new update , i hate that you cant mute this Video calling part because i get ransoms ppl calling my phone ... ppl just dont believe in personal space no more"
"Stop Changing Things at Random and Errors. I have 2 insta pages, one personal and one business. With all the hype about reels it seems to have disappeared from my business page while still being available on my personal page. Additionally, Instagram no longer allows access for me to create a store and yet continues to send me notifications on how to fix it. When I begin the process, I get an error message"
TERRIBLE. I can't gain access to my Instagram account it was hacked and no one helped me
"This app is driving me insane. I upgraded my iPhone a month ago and since then the Instagram app has not worked properly on my phone. I can use every feature except if I click on the button on the far right on the bottom to go to my profile, the entire screen goes black with some sort of glitch. I currently cannot use my business page as intended because I can&#39;t see of that data and tracking info. I can use instagram on the web but that feature isn&#39;t available on their mobile site. It&#39;s definitely the app because if my phone is charging I can still see the little green icon at the top of a black screen. This is infuriating"
Needs better support. Ive never had such a bad experience with an app before. My account has currently been hacked and I cannot get any help whatsoever on how to get it back. Ive been jumping through a million hoops for the last 24 hours and still nothing. Ive done everything thats on the help center and its not working Im so upset because Ive had this same account for over 10 years. It has memories of my family members that have since passed and photos of my children. My account was very private because I dont want just anyone having access to photos of my kids and now some rando has that access. Its a severe invasion of privacy and Im super upset that theres no support or anything to help get my account back. Yall really need to DO BETTER FOR THR SAKE OF PEOPLES PRIVACY Im so sick to my stomach and will probably never use this app again because of it
"Business Accounts are a Complete Waste of Time. Instagrams new moderator does more harm than good for small businesses on Instagram. One of my business accounts was disabled for an unknown reason. They do not give you any information on how to resolve thee issue, they will just shut down your account and you have to completely start over. I spent hours trying to get this account back up but nothing worked. They had absolutely no useful information on how to troubleshoot or resolve the problem. I gave up on that account and created a new one. After losing literally months worth of content and hours that I could have been spending making money, I came across my next problem. Setting up a new account and attempting to gain followers is a nightmare. I attempted to follow the accounts that I already had on my personal account and after following only 288 people in the matter of 4 days, I was action blocked. The block was suppose to last two days, which is ridiculous all on its own. To top that off, the action block still hasnt been lifted. I have lost countless hours on Instagram attempting to lift this off of my account and I have lost a ton of business because now people think I am a scam. On top of all of this, Instagram no longer has their own customer service. You are suppose to fill out a form and theyll get around to your query eventually, but just to kick me while Im down I am not even able to submit the forms Instagram is only out to line their pockets and they are attacking struggling small business owners for their own personal gain. What a joke. Update: since writing this honest review the action block on my account has been extended 3 more days. I suspect it is in retaliation considering the extension occurred while I was still action blocked. I had no way of breaking the guidelines a second time around due to the restrictions, so I am clearly being discriminated against"
Login Activity. I dont know if my account is being hacked or if its a glitch that insta has that it says Im somewhere Im not on login activity but I dont have other devices connected it says this phone but another location
App doesnt work. I dont get push notifications nor can I share my story to Facebook Ive done every hack for both and they dont work 
What is happening to my account?. It shows as if I have a personal account rather than a business account. After the update I have to refresh my profile several times to see the insights. Today I have tried multiple times to refresh and it still shows it as a personal account
"Performs poorly on wifi. This app does terrible on wifi. Things just dont load after a while. I have tried uninstalling the app, checked for updates, turned wifi on and off, etc. Paid attention to time of day.... It doesnt matter where I am, what time it is, it simply performs poorly on wifi. Doesnt matter which service, router, etc. I cant use cellular data very often since all of the videos automatically play, though I have not noticed any loading issues when I use data. Ive upgraded my phone, used other peoples phones, and it still performs poorly. The thing is, other apps dont have this problem. Only Instagram. Plus... the whole algorithm is bollocks. I want an option to see only lesser known people, not the same 3 people with millions of followers"
SERIOUSLY? Im in tears. Ive been a loyal insta fan for MANY years now. Recently my account was hacked. I only knew cuz my friends were telling me (on other platforms) the account was sending spam. I contacted IG and was advised that there was nothing they could do but I should change my password and setup Duo (2 factor ID I use for work without incident). I did both and since then was never again able to login to my account. Try multiple times to contact Ig. Account hacked still and apparently still sending spam. Told account PERMANENTLY DISABLED. Will lose my pictures of my son I dont have anywhere else FOREVER for violating repeatedly rules. I have NEVER in my life NOT ONCE violated the rules of this app or any other for that matter. I have a chance to plead my case by responding to email to tell story of what happened. I do. Over a month later NO reply. I email again. Get instant reply IG/FB no longer accepting communication by this method. Try our help page. What? Help page? That helps NOT AT ALL. After some time I try to cope with my sadness and make new account with different email so at least can follow some friends during this difficult time. Account immediately disabled. Unable to verify codes. What? How? I didnt receive any Maybe its a problem with my phone number? Try again with a 3rd email. Put different phone number.  Suspicious account activity. Verify before we shut down your account. ALL I Did was setup an account. Y is that suspicious? Why in a time of social distancing when everyone keeps saying well at least we can stay in touch thru INstagram cant I have an INSTAGRAM? I am seriously clinically depressed from this. IG/FB u should be ASHAMED to treat a loyal rule-abiding patron of years like this
"Why do i feel like i'm on a shopping app,.?. The whole point of the app is to share pictures and videos, so why on earth has the notifications tab turned into the QVC website? why is there a shopping tab? i have never bought anything off of an instagram add, nor will I ever because quite frankly, the adds and sponsored posts are extremely annoying. not to mention the &#34;view older posts&#34; change. obviously if i&#39;m scrolling through my feed, i want to see what&#39;s on my feed. if i wanted to see random posts from random accounts who i DONT follow, i would go to my explore page. isn&#39;t that the whole point of it? I don&#39;t understand the changes and it&#39;s literally making the whole app annoying to me and i&#39;m becoming such a twitter person because of it. U used to post all the time and use the app frequently bc it&#39;s so full of things i don&#39;t care about now, that u rarely go on it even once a day for 5 mins"
"GOOD APP , BUT WE DONT LIKE THE NEW UPDATES. i would like  to be able to access my data"
"Blocking someone. One thing I loved about Instagram is that when you block someone the whole conversation disappears. Now, you can still view it and its extremely horrible Blocking someone can be for various reasons and when the conversation is still visible, it can trigger bad and negative emotions. Please fix it"
Stealing my data. Stole my data
"2 issues: Likes & Notifcations. I am using an iPhone 7, iOS 14.1 (latest software update).First issue -&gt; I cant see the count to how many likes I have, I thought that was a pilot. PLEASE DISCONTINUE THE STUPID TESTING, cant run a business without seeing my likes, I hate having to go to each individual post tapping into the likes just to see how the post is doing especially when EVERYONE ELSE CAN SEE MY LIKES and their own BESIDES ME.Second issue -&gt; I dont get ANY notifications for anything Instagram related unless I go into the app and it with shows me either badges on the profile page indicating that one of my other accounts has a notification, or the badges by the messages/activity sections with dots under each section. My accounts tell me to Turn on Notifications every once in a while and when I click it, it takes me into Settings but theres nothing there to adjust notification settings like other apps.. no banners, no badges, nothing Please fix, these are crucial factors to be able to use this platform effectively for business and personal use"
Reels - no response from Instagram. I have inquired multiple times (for months) with no response. Ive tried everything under the sun and still cant access reels on my account. It is available in my area. So frustrating. They want paid content but cant even access the info I should be able to
"The ads are starting to stack up. Still a solid app, but the concentration of ads is really beginning to add up. There are sponsored posts every few images now and rarely do they contribute anything positive to the feed.Also please stop stealing all of our data"
"Notifications. Absolutely love the app. Its incredible for me as a content creator, but the notifications are really buggy It will show that I have notifications on my accounts when I just simply dont. Theres gotta few some explanation/fix for this"
"Missing features. Its pretty frustrating that I have add post to story missing on my personal account. I used to have it before until it disappeared. My account settings have not been changed. I cant share the posts from my business page to my personal account.  I can add posts to story on my business account. Ive googled missing add posts to story IG and theres a ton of articles some dating back to 2017 explaining that Instagram is buggy and theres no real fix for it. Some articles suggested to restart the phone, delete the app, logging out, disabling the account or even starting a new IG account. Ive reached to IG support and have not heard back. This is a known problem and they havent done anything to fix it"
"Spy Wear. Be careful, terms of service state they own allYour data, and have full access to all data on your device, including microphone"
"What is this?. Ok, so this app seems really good, but it has one GLARING issue. You have to put in you phone number, which wouldnt be a problem. However, it is supposed to send a verification code to you through SMS. However, I never get sent this code. Then, when I ask to to be sent it again, it says Sorry, there was an error, try again, despite me have excellent both Cellular Data and WiFi. And while if I could I would absolutely give my phone just so I could USE the APP, Im also left wondering why its mandatory in the first place, considering Ive already given my email, and surely that should be enough to contact me since I check  it regularly, but NO, I guess they just need MORE of my personal information, dont they? Classic FaceBook"
Unclear how to use the app and its actual value and use. Please give me more information
"Beware the new Terms & Conditions. Boycotting in support of Instagrams new terms of use as of Dec 20th 2020 which harm sex educators, sex workers, and anyone who cares about privacy protection, and will use them to continue its discrimination against disabled, fat, nonwhite, femme, trans, and otherwise marginalized bodies.Use Mastodon instead "
"Highlights privacy. Instagram should create an option to hide or show highlights ( like a ghost mode of certain highlights that we still want to keep, but we just dont want all people to see)"
THESE BOTS. had to put my profile on private because I would get spam messages and I still get follow requests from bots every other day. they would tag you in random stuff photos too. Please do something about this
"Issues. Both my personal account and my public account are blocked from engaging. When I try to like, comment, post a story, follow anyone etc, I keep getting a pop up saying we restrict certain activity to protect our community ???? I post pictures of my cat. So how am I a threat??I cant get any reply from sending in forms in the help section. I havent gotten any reply from email or messaging Instagram. I havent done anything scandalous. I havent harassed anyone. I dont post offensive content. I dont write rude comments. If this is a program glitch. Fix it. An explanation would be very much appreciated"
"New idea. Can you please add an update where you can control what specific people can see on your page? There are people I dont want to make them unfollow me but I respectfully dont want them to see some of my posts for personal reasons. Yea, theres archive, but I mean an update where you can still have the post up, but you can block any specific person from seeing it"
"Unbanned my account I havent violated any rules. Hello  my personal Instagram account @shayyhazel has been disabled for almost 3months now, I have tried so many ways to appeal through the link that were given on the website but  it doesnt seem to be working , and I have also try other way to recover my account back through another link but I keep on received same email over and over again. Note that I have also reported an impersonator account , this account @nnuralieyaaa (note that she keep changing her username) has been using my picture for inappropriate purposes, she been scamming people and sending inappropriate pictures and texts. And I have also lodge a police report against her for my own protection. Please I need to access my account back, I would really appreciate it if you could help me retrieve my account back"
Hacked. Been trying to get my Instagram baxk from being hacked. Sent the info you asked for. How long does it take to get it restored.  Shouldn&#39;t be this hard
"Privacy infringement. Bias towards Israel, censors content relating to Palestine "
Instagram do not help their users. My Instagram has been hacked and now some stranger has access to all my personal information Ive tried contacting Instagram multiple times with no help at all from them What a waste of effort and time I have put into my Instagram account. Very disappointed Definitely will not be signing up again. Unsafe and helpless towards loyal users
"Hacked. Ive been using Instagram for a while and to me its 5 stars, Im only doing this 2 stars so you guys can see this review. Pretty much there are too many spam accounts and recently my account got hacked without me knowing I got an email saying my 2-factor got turned off and my number on my profile was changed and my password and that my email was removed from the account, I followed all steps to get the account back but it was pretty much gone so I texted my friends to report the account cause they told me that it started spamming forex and DMing people I follow and my actual friends spam stuff I guess and I dont want anybody to get tricked into thinking thats me still even though they can kinda tell its not but even with all the reports of the account, the account is still there and thats whats annoying, I made a new account not a big deal its social media Im not gonna cry but if like 30 people are reporting the account you should actually review it and take it down if you did review it and saw nothing wrong well then good luck to you all"
Horrible service. I have been using Instagram for years and have had the same account for as long as I can remember. Recently my account kept giving me notifications that there were unrecognised login attempts so I changed my password and continued to use my account as normal it was then completely inaccessible and had no explanation for why i had been blocked from accessing it. Now nearly a week later Ive been told that it was disabled due to my behaviour?? I have done nothing wrong and have had no warnings I had made several appointments and purchases through my Instagram dms and now cant even access them Im fuming and have been trying to do everything asked of me including explaining the situation and also sending a photo of me with a number etc but still no access to my account. I wont ever be making a new account as that one has all my memories and contacts Ive given up on the concept now. Instagram seriously need to work on how they manage accounts as I have not posted nor dont anything to deserve this criminal treatment yet accounts showing all sorts of things that are prohibited are still allowed to be up but my personal account isnt?
"Please please fix my account. Ive been on Instagram since it came out when I was in the 11th grade (Im 24 now). I cant share any posts to my story. None. No matter what I do. I literally dont have that capability or option. I have looked up every help &amp; hack on the internet and have come up empty. Its not about the privacy, I will see my friends share a quote from a public account and I try to do the same and I cant share it. Theres literally no option that appears of add post to story. Ive reported it hundreds of times and keep giving up but maybe you will see it and actually fix it"
PLEASE PLEASE FIX. Ive had my Instagram for over 5 years And loved it until I got hacked and Instagram isnt doing anything to help me get BOTH of my accounts back I was hacked and I was disabled from BOTH accounts  The ONLY way to get it back is from Instagram sending security code to THE WRONG NUMBER . smh because I have a lot of important pictures. And this is the SECOND time this has happened my other account I had since 2014 I lost all my pictures and videos ( my phone that had the original pictures was stolen). I got hacked or phished and I cant access my account because it has my old number ( I cant get security code) I cant even open the app because it has been disabled . I cant log in because my old password was changed by the hacker and I made a new account and Instagram locked me out of my new account also . After I was hacked I was still able to access my old account because its saved to my phone(remember password) please help . My account was a animal account and I would be so devastated if I lose all my years of pictures
ADD FACE ID TO INSTAGRAM. I really would love for Instagram to allow Face ID to work when you need to get into instagram.I think Instagram should allow us to use Face ID before going to our page. Just incase people want to keep their account private and not let others see their account if they let someone use their phone.It would be cool to already be logged into Instagram but use Face ID to open instagram
"Glitches?. I have no idea, but Instagram has been glitching for me. I do not know if this was just me but I asked my friends and they did not have the same problems. It would not let me like anything saying it was blocked for me and it was to help follow the guidelines. It had never done this before so I was really confused when I checked my feed. Also besides this I wasnt able to change my password, I was very aggravated and I wanted to change it for privacy reasons so when it said to go check my messages and I could change it right after. I assumed it would work, it had not and I was very confused. Besides that the app is fun, if you use it correctly and that is why Im giving it three stars"
"Good adding app but far too many ads. App is working and efficient for browsing but too many ads, far too many... and obvious violations of privacy through cross-apps user tracking"
"REALLY UNHAPPY AND DEVASTATED. My account got deactivated for no reason and with no warning. I havent gone against any term of use, conditions or guidelines so it is definitely a mistake and an technical error but Ive been trying to get it back for 3 weeks now before it gets deleted Ive sent emails, made reports and had very little response. Instagram emailed me a code to take a picture with nearly 2 weeks ago and still no response to the point Ive had to do it over and over again and still no response Its my personal page that Ive had for many years (over 3 years) with pictures of me and my family and friends growing up Including that had pasted away (like my older sister) I cant get any of those pictures back its really upsetting and depressing even I love Instagram and usually use it for hours daily and have even found family all across the world and only have contact with them via Instagram. I am so upset and disappointed and am devastated that this have happened because Ive done everything I can to try and get my account back but it potentially could still get deleted because Instagram hasnt responded or helped me"
This isnt ok. Hello people of instagram Im Jordyn i am a 15 year old user who has been using this app since 6th or 7th grade and Im a high schooler now. And my account has been hacked 3 time and the last time I was hacked out of my account and now unable to access that old account or a new one and its frustrating me because my pictures my texts my information is now out of my control and others now have it understand that Im not blaming u for somebody elses careless decisions just know that I am saying it shouldnt have been so easy for this to be a secure app for teens and up thank u for your time
"Hope your account never gets hacked. Over ten months ago my account was hacked. Since then I have been asked to provide confirmation codes, photos of me holding codes, both forms of my identification, email addresses, phone numbers and Ive yet to be granted access back to my account. My handle matches all of my other social media accounts and have friends who have passed away still on my friends list so I dont want to start a new account. Until my account was hacked, IG was my app of choice. I now have got to the stage I get email notifications about my account. I think its just to spite me at this point. Or perhaps just to remind me of how I dont have access to my account. Still no access. The word help just isnt in their vocabulary. I recommend using Twitter or snap"
"Privacy for posts, too. Please make a way to restrict someone from seeing your posts. Its like that for stories, but not posts?"
"Connectivity. Having a lot of connectivity issues. I dont care so much in regards to my personal account, but this is definitely tough for a business account to be down without connectivity for extended time. All this coming after the day long outage that was reported via twitter and not in an email to users. Looking to get the issue resolved, would definitely love for these types of issues to be prioritized. The general platform creates so much accessibility where it has never existed prior, though, so keeping it within context Ill keep the rating high. Im sure this is less an IG problem and more who yall work with to provide internet access. Thanks yall for always doing your thing and making IG work  "
"Lack of response, inconsistent. I have a personal account and a business account. For some reason issues keep coming up on my business account. I depend on user engagement but how can I do that when I cant engage with my audience? I cant share my posts to my story. I cant share their content to my story. Ive tried everything to reset the functionality but nothing. And trying to ask IG for help? A joke"
"Very poor personal app. I dont understand why in the world Im blocked from posting on my story... Im not able to share things from other peoples page Which is weird because on my other account I am... Ive done deleted this app try to see if it needs to be updated But for some odd reason its literally not letting me post on my story Which is so weird This issue can not continue, it needs to be fixed What is wrong with Instagram? I will leave a poor review until you guys figure out whats going with my account. Im not able to share things to my story I would at least like to be informed why not... but respectfully please look into this"
"very disappointed. hi. ive been trying to get my account back for a week now after it was hacked and then deleted by instagram. I have filled multiple forms and also even sent a picture of my face with me holding the code that I got sent, but I just got a response saying that I got disabled for not following the rules. you can tell how passionate I am about this account and Im not going to give up until I get a response but at this point its just very tiring. I have carefully read rules and regulations of instagram and I understand and implement them as well, but my account was recently hacked without me knowing and any recent activity on the account that violates the rules was 100% not me. I dont see how I am at fault in this since I got the account back right before I got deleted. I have not done anything wrong. I understand the rules and I will absolutely follow them in the future like I always had before. I ensure you. please reactivate my account. it means a lot to me. thank you"
A great app. Hi I am a self-employed personal trainer. Ive been using Instagram for a while now and its great for work and for connecting with people. Great for learning things so thank you for what you guys do it Instagram
Hidden friends and #. This app is my favorite but I dont like the privacy. I would like hide my friends and # . So please help me with that
I need help. Okay so my Instagram says Ive been compromised trying to advertise my account to get more followers when my account is on private and Ive never done that because idc about followers. No one knows my personal info and its not letting me log out to try to reset it. Please if someone is having the same problem and knows how to fix it please please PLEASE tell me
Poor customer service. There is no customer service or support to help you. Ive had a previous account hacked and stolen and no one at Instagram will respond to get that old account back. The algorithm changes are also a nightmare to keep up with and hurts engagement. Please help me get back @toyhypeusacom
Censorship overload. IG is only worth being on if you like flipping through boring magazines. Theyre gaslighting testimonials of people with reactions to the V. They are in cahoots with corrupt agencies and should be ashamed. Literally anti-science as they HIDE AND DELETE DATA that is needed during these trial phases
Bugged. Couldnt post anything on my accounts it said to check my connection so I turned my phone off and on and my connection worked on all of my other apps along with my data so I deleted the app to see if my phone didnt update it and now I cant log back into Instagram because of my connection
10stars for Instagram. I love Instagram I use it for work and personal use 
10stars for Instagram. I love Instagram I use it for work and personal use
New update. I have been using Instagram since it was brand spanking new day 1 every time they did a update I never was happy .. but then I got used to it. Anyways I dont like this last new update Im sad we cant see what our friends like no more but I assume thats a privacy thing. So I respect that. I dont like how the reels have a part on the bottom I dont care for them I dont care about shopping for items either . Why is my likes on the left its so confusing frustrating I wish they moved it back its just too much at this point
Instagram is great so far. I like Instagram a lot so far. Its like your own personal magazine
"Absolutely no support. Theres nobody to contact or get help with anything. I lost my phone and forever lost access to my account as far as I can tell. I have the email address linked, but whenever I try to log in, it just tries to send a text to my old number/phone. No way to recover. Real smart instagram"
"Recent update issues. I absolutely hate this new system of posts on the feed. I dont want to see recommended posts on my personal feed. I dont follow those accounts for a reason: because I dont want to see them. Absolutely awful decision, revert back to the original so system immediately"
Hate that Instagram wont help. My original Instagram account was hacked and stolen by Sophia.lee.tt. I had over 1000 followers and even more pictures. I have proof that it was my account  Ive tried to contact Instagram but they do NOTHING
Violation of rights. Selectively and deliberately blocking content is a new level of lack of autonomy and privacy. You cant choose to sensor some voices. #freepalestine
"Instagram Business Horrible. Ive been trying to contact Instagram theres not a phone number insight It started when I tried switching from business to personal because I wasnt able to link my Facebook page, then switching from personal back to the business account is when this nightmare started. Im now receiving error messages that An error occurred and Instagram is working to get it fixed. Ive emailed and no response from Instagram. Im weeks in and still unable to switch my account from personal to business this is Horrible and Instagram needs to do better"
Show us who is also following private accts again. Why did you remove the ability for us to see who we can forward a picture to??? Yes we know some accounts are private. And we used to be able to forward pictures amongst ourselves on top of a notice of the account is private to certain people that also follow the account.  it is exceptionally annoying trying to remember who is also following the account. Why are you making us go to their main page and check if that person is also following the account. Going to stop forwarding peoples pictures. Way to cut down engagement. 
"Terrible at fixing problems. I am one of few people who have a problem with My account, have reported it at least 30+ times in order to try and get the problem fixed, as it is a problem with my business account I am unable to share other peoples posts to my stories Even my own personal posts that I have tried to post to my business Instagram story (for example, my personal Instagram isnt private therefore anyone can share my posts to their stories) So its not because peoples accounts are on private  Have no had a response at all and it effects business. Main take away: needs to get better at responding to individual issues on Instagram as its a joke.... 2 months of reports and still nothing has been done and no one has contacted me to say anything"
Why?. Every time Instagram makes an update is manages to get worse. I personally never even click on the shopping tab. I found and shopped for plenty of things from the trending page. Posting stories and keeping track of your photos is a horribly difficult now. Disappointing
"This app is terrible. Im unable to login my Instagram account on my iPhone,if I should on Instagram cellular data and switch to Instagram app the Instagram cellular data I on will have go off ,and this is disheartening..please find something to do about it in time.thanks in advance"
Hating Instagram. Im really starting to HATE Instagram. I really hate how they make it IMPOSSIBLE to delete and ACCESS your accounts. I have changed my password to attempt to delete one of my accounts I made for a job. Now I cant access my PERSONAL account. And I dont have the 8 codes for the two step verification. I cant get a code via my cell for some reason and my third account was either hacked or I cant access that one either. I NEED HELP and I cant even get HELP. Im so done
"Big Tech Overlords. The recent changes to the terms of service are a violation of our basic rights to privacy. But big tech doesnt care, and they arent held accountable. Mark Z is more interested in snooping into your life in order to cancel or censor what you stand for if he doesnt deem it acceptable. Time for a boycott"
"CHALLENGE_REQUIRED ISSUE. Cannot log inI know all my log in data, its also connected to my Facebook & has the two step verification set up. Its all completely USELESS. Im having a Challenge_required issue. I enter all my log in information and then I sent to a page saying get help logging in when I click this I am prepared to give more identification that I own the account but NO. From there Im then taken directly to the Instagram help centre, this does not help me in anyway to verify that I own this account and after nearly 2 months I still do not have any access. Its a never ending loop, no matter what device or anything that I try. I am absolutely appalled. Ive reported this issue so many times - all to no response. Horrendous PLEASE FIX THIS (@Lydia.f.baker)"
Woaw. Cant believe this app gets worse every time I open it. Since Facebook took over the app its only gone downwards. Can we expect anything else from the same company that sells data to make money?
"Sensorship/hacking. I cant access my own feed. Every time I click on my feed, it turns black. No one else has this issue. So, what is this? Even after deleting my insta and redpwnpoading it"
"Still havent heard back from Instagram support team about my hacked account. Ive recently been hacked & have been trying to send proof to Instagram support team that my account has been taken over by someone that isnt me for the past week but have yet to receive a response back. Please Im begging for help I have a lot of sentimental content of my baby brother, whom recently passed, on my account . Please , please , please help me"
Spying. Stop spying on me
Love It. Love the variety of pics and people to follow Something for everyone and also a good way to keep up with friends  But when youre hacked and lose your Account - say goodbye to all those conversations
"No Privacy & Unlike Post Issues. April 05, 2022 review - Issue from previous review still not addressed and here is another one. Why is it so difficult to UNLIKE a post now? You can only unlike a maximum of 30 posts per hour but yet you can LIKE hundreds per hours, doesnt make any sense There is a glitch that says you dont have any post to unlike so you have to life a random post then go back to see your other posts just to unlike them? Also, the posts you like come up in a weird format now and it take a long time to even load up in the first place.December 04, 2021 review - Its almost 2022 and Instagram STILL does not allow you to hide who youre following from the people that follow you This is a feature that has been available on Facebook for YEARS Seeing how Facebook has owned Instagram since 2012, I assumed this important privacy feature would have been added by now. There is no valid reason for Instagram to not have the option of not allowing your followers to see the accounts you follow. People dont want everyone to see the account they follow for multiple privacy reason. This is especially important for female users Please update Instagram so you can hide who youre following for all followers or at least certain followers, thank you"
Hacked account / No support. My instagram account was hacked. Ive tried several times to regain access with no luck. There is no way to report or contact a human being for help. So now the hacker is using my account to hack other people. The hacker changed my phone number and email so I can not do a account recovery
"Love it. Great for sharing your photography and for personal fun use too. I love instagram, wish there were more options for showing off top photos and customizing your profile, but I do love Instagram"
Disabled Account for no reason. My account has been disabled for no reason or someone has hacked my account and caused it to be disabled which now I cannot even log in and all of my friends are telling me the account shows user not found this account is my personal Instagram account and I need it back The Instagram help centre shows nothing that can help my situation and I need it to be resolved now This has caused so much stress and anxiety that I wont ever get my account back as I had a large following and Ive had the account for over 5 years I need all of my photos and videos back I need my whole account back and restored so can Instagram please do there bit and help my situation now rather than in months to come because this has caused a lot of negativity in my life right now and will only cause even more if I dont get it back or get help I will completely loose hope for instagrams safety on users of there app and will never use it again I know that wont make much of a difference to them but this should not be happening after being a loyal user for so many years
"Trash. The recent update took away literally every song. I cant access any good music to post, its all stuff I have never heard of. My notifications do not come to my phone. I have to physically go inside of the app to see my messages, they dont come to my phone in a notification. Just a couple of months ago I couldnt even open instagram. I dont know what yall have going on, but fix it"
"Instagram Guides. Yeah, I cant make any and yet I can make on on my person? I have my other account longer than my personal"
"Main account : nasseralsalehq8. Dear Instgram management Good day i wish you retain my main account :nasseralsalehq8 since all my memories and personal photos records for many years maybe I have posted copyright video but I was not aware of it and usually I appeal for videos I post that I am not sure of with regards to copy right but I dont deserve to be blocked and If I did post it was not intentionally. all my friends and contacts  and memories are on that account I would appreciate allowing me access again to my account regards,Nasser A.Al-Saleh"
Hacked. Me and my friends have been hacked by some one and it has to stop because people are going to the link and that is just how the hacker gets your information
Keeps spamming large videos into my discovery feed. They automatically play and waste data. Massive video that takes up half my screen of the same dumb 16 year old dancing
"Ruined a decent app. Instagram has potential to be a fun social media platform for business and personal use but the new update is atrocious. Instead of scrolling through your feed and seeing all the new posts then the older posts, Insta now only shows you the fewest most recent posts then shows you promoted posts instead of older posts. Absolutely ridiculous. Makes it nearly unenjoyable"
"Enabling resharing of my stories. So, I have selected on privacy and story settings to allow the resharing of my stories onto other peoples stories. However many people have told me they arent able to reshare my story, I tried with my other account and it also wouldnt let me reshare my story"
Privacy Concern. Tap on Following and Followers Remove SUGGESTED FOR YOU
"My opinion. I used to be on Insta all the time. It was my #1. Since youre algorithm started refreshing so quickly I no longer care for it very much. No one has time to see my posts. I used to be able to appeal to audiences outside of my personal group but I no longer get very many follows or likes. My content quality has not gone down. I understand you thought you were improving it, but you were not. Sometimes it does not need to be fixed"
Idk. I literally cant use insta without wifi and I have unlimited data so I can use any apps anywhere without wifi
"Wont let me log in. Had my account for years and now every time I try to log in on my phone app it says sorry, there was a problem with your request However I can log into my account on a browser just fine. In this problem I realized Instagram has zero customer support what so ever and I have no idea what to do. This is beyond frustrating and I cant access my business page"
"this app used to be fun. the app used to be super fun to use, but at this point i want to uninstall it. its only stupid reels for the WHOLE home page. i want to see pictures my friends post, not a bunch of videos from accounts that i dont even know i followed. i was okay with reels if it was in its own separate part of instagram, but now instagram is just trying to be tiktok, which we DONT WANT"
"Instagram designed for the patriarchy. Considering your user base likely tilts female, you all should sincerely reconsider where you put most buttons for interaction. The newest update puts reels and shopping at the bottom and messages and notifications at the tippy top out of reach. My phone designed for a mans hand and this Instagram designed for a mans hand underscores the lack of women either on your UX team and the data bias in this world. Please reconsider, my right thumb begs you"
Good. Mark Zuckerberg is stealing my data
New music update. Overall it is an amazing app which ive been using for almost 5 years now. I decided to make my account a business account when the feature became available to grow my audience. With the new update i noticed that i cant add music to my stories and go a notification to why i cant use the feature. I made my account personal and private once again but unfortunately the music feature doesnt allow me to use all the song available and instead the only options are the facebook songs. please fix this
"Garbage app now. Spam me with MORE ads and suggested follows, why dont you? As if I dont have enough I follow on my own? You do realize people build their follows over years of use? Ask one of those geniuses you hire to collate data on how many followers can a person have before they cant go through their entire feed anymore and neglect previous follows due to the sheer amount of content being pumped in already? LET ME DECIDE WHO I WANT TO FOLLOW AND STOP THROWING SUGGESTIONS AT ME AND CUT DOWN ON THE ADVERTISEMENTS THEY ARE AT BOMBARDMENT LEVELS Im sure Ill get the generic response of, We strive to do the best Yeah, no s*it, but its not good enough. Im sitting there confused as to what Im even looking at at times. Im spending half my time removing content from my feed. ITS ANNOYING"
better help and support. Hey there So I love Instagram the app but your customer service needs some serious work. I was inputting my birthday when the app crashed and it set my birth year as 2020. Obviously I was not born in 2020 trying to make an instagram account. Because of this I was immediately logged out of my account for being an underage account. So I appealed this because Im 19 years old and it has been a few weeks since you asked me to send pictures of my drivers license/passport proving my age...but there hasnt been a response since. And I cant contact anyone. So instagram has my personal information just floating around and no responders helping me get my account back. If you could help me Id greatly appreciate it because I really do love the app. My username is @camille.brooke
"Dysfunctional app. In instagrams attempt to make their app more streamlined, they end up creating even more annoying functionality problems. Instagram recently updated how the audio on their reels work. You used to be able to toggle the audio on and off by just taping the reel. Now tapping the screen just pauses the video, you cant turn off the audio at all *sometimes*. Other times, turning the volume down just one notch will permanently mute any reel you watch with no non convoluted way of turning it back on. You either have to fully restart the app, or find a NON REEL video on your explore page (which are becoming few and far between for some reason), tap the unmute button on that video, and go BACK to the reel tab to hear any audio. God forbid you want to make a slight volume adjustment otherwise youll have to do it all over again. Please revert the reel audio toggling back to just a tap on or off, holding the screen was adequate enough to pause the reel. Secondly, Instagram is the ONLY app Ive ever used on my phone that struggles playing videos. I constantly have wifi and data on my phone, but so often Instagram will have playback issues where a video will only play 3 seconds before freezing. I could turn my wifi and data on and off, restart the app, and shut down my phone, and nothing will improve the playback glitch. Ridiculous for a video centered app to struggle playing videos on a modern phone. Finally, instagrams moderation is a joke. Every day on this app I come across utterly vile comments and posts that very blatantly violate instagrams TOS, or even violate straight up laws, and Ill report them. Low and behold, thirty minutes later Ill receive an update on my report saying that someones disgusting comment or post doesnt violate their guidelines. But god forbid I say something even slightly mean on Instagram or Ill face a shadow ban or have my posts and comments automatically taken down. Utterly laughable"
Keeps turning off Data when opening Instagram. Annoying keeps automatically turning off data when opening Instagram app only. This happened last year now again GRRRR
"if a bottom line was a UI Designer. does Instagram actually talk to or test their users before redesigning their UI? Has anyone in their user test groups actually used Instagram? Are they sentient? Instagram seems determined to move features that are heavily used or helpful to non-intuitive UI hidey holes, move features they think we want (we dont) to easy access points, and then ignore the things we ask for. Like maybe stop shoving reels down our throat, and give us access to user data with no time limits. Captions with in-app rich text formatting. Ability to add in plugins for what you need insta for. Ability to easily edit your grid. But nope: HAVE YOU TRIED OUR BUGGY SHOPPING THING CUZ YOU SHOULDvibes of : oh no hun wut you doing?? but x100"
"Fix this app. Ive been using Instagram since 2015 and its so bad right now. First of all, why does explore swipe for me? Ill be half way through reading a post and itll swipe for me? Second, why can I not edit my bio using data? Lastly, why do you cut my pictures. Ill post a picture of my face and when I post it, it moves the photo and cuts half my face off. Youd think an old app would know how to handle bugs, but nothing ever changes Please fix ur app im tired of getting extra mad at Instagram while looking at stupid posts"
"Instagram is awesome. I love using Instagram Many years ago, when it just came Out I thought that the filters options are incredible, but It grew in to the most amazing social networking where u can post about urself that kind creates a digital memory of ur life Post, be creative and # ur quotes YOLO so try to make it a good pic for ur friends to admire and for u to look back years later and say oh yeah that was a dope time Instagram is the best, by far Injoy it world ;)"
"INSTA NEEDA SEE THIS. So i downloaded this app for fun and a fan page And its great but please dont deleted peoples fan pages. Theyre obviously real so why are you doing that? If people dont show their identity thats fine you know, but like what if they want their stuff personal and dont want to? Then what. THANK YOU FOR READING Love this app by the way No offence lol"
"Your account Was Compromised Message. Im fairly new to posting on Instagram. Just started really posting since the pandemic. While using the Instagram app this message pops up your account was compromised.  Then change password flashed, so I changed my password multiple times trying to log back in. I manage to log on to one account but unsuccessful in seeing post, followers and whatever else in my 2nd account. . I dont  know if I was hacked or what. Tried to contact Instagram help support but have been unsuccessful.  The kicker is my account is still active. I had a family member check to see if they could see my page since I cant and they let me know its still there and active. . I just cant see it. If the developers are reading this review. Please reactivate my account or notify with instructions on how to fix the problem. The account is : eye_capture7. Im not a bot. Im a real person. Check my Facebook account and you will see. I have not have I been using any type of services or app for likes and follows. Im following the rules when using this app. I truly believe I was just targeted by algorithms. Please Help  If you need to contact me by email, Please do so. Thanks. By the way this need to be fixedIt may also be identity thief. Who knows. I need assistance"
"It\'s good..but. I really like the app.I have two account on there. My personal and my spare accounts.The app is amazing but I have found a bug or glitch were you can&#39;t like posts and it comes up with that it has been blocked.It started with a few posts but then every post Its like it comes up with the same thing.Its very annoying.I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only person who is having this problem or other people are.Also Ive found out that there are now some hackers on the app, they would send you some message and you would put your Instagram password and it wouldnt do anything, the message they send looks like its from instagram but its not, I did put my instagram password onto it and its the password or all my accounts on instagram,I kinda dont feel safe anymore,I dont know if my account has been hacked or not. If instagram could sort it out I would feel a lot safer and better when going onto Instagram. I know some of my friends have done it and there accounts have been hacked,Instagram really need to sort this out"
My profile. I cannot access my profile every time i press the button to go on my personal profile it goes blank and i have to exit entire Instagram app Help Please
Stop tracking. I want you guys to stop tracking us Its fecking annoying
More privacy. Can you please have a restricted mode where people cannot see your followers or who you are following?
"Horrible no way to contact Instagram support. My account was hacked and my password/email/phone number was changed m, Instagram never sent me any type of security message saying these things were changed I found out when I tried to log back in after being logged out. I continuously reported the account because they were posting pretending to be me, Instagrams report team or whatever it is sent me a notification back saying they see no problems with the account and they will not be removing it. I tried emailing Instagram and reporting a problem countless number of times and nothing. The account is still active and still posting even after I had all my friends also report it for impersonating someone they know"
"Random scenic photos. Every single photo for the last 2 weeks has been scenic and nature pictures. Every single one being shown to me is boring, and just simple photography shots. I dont like these things. My friends phone shows a normal feed.This is my upstairs neighbour &amp; his friend constantly bothering us through our internet devices. He blocks our Facebook account previously, he hacks into the wifi system and configured settings on our devices, installs malware on them, spyware and keystrokes, he sends nature videos, conspiracy theories, and other weird things. Its not the algorithm its not the regular photos I see on a regular basis. Its extremely annoying when I am trying to scroll through and look and every single photo no matter when I refresh it or what I do its constant nature pictures and things that not only I dont enjoy , but normally are not there. I have a screenshot and screen recording if you need to see it. My friends phone doesnt do this. It seems like its being sent directly to my Instagram account. Every single photo its almost like spam"
Hacked. Someone Easily hacked my account and go to my Facebook. No security notification once so ever
"Worst company ever, no respect for freedom of speech. Worst company ever, they track you and your data and take money from monitoring you They dont allow people tonexpress what they feel or want to say , they only keep what they want to deliver Dont use this app, "
Incredibly bad customer support. I have had an Instagram since 2012 Im an artist and would post my content every other day i had about 1.5k followers. Recently I was hacked and tried to reach out to the Instagram support team. I tried everything I could and had dozens of my followers try to report the account that had been hacked. Still no response from IG. I then decided to create a new account.  That account was blocked through IG because they thought I was impersonating the old account that I had that had been hacked. I still received NO response from IG despite emailing them through the FB help line. If you are at all interested in keeping your privacy a priority DO NOT use this app. If anything goes wrong (and it can especially with all the scammers now on the platform ) you will have no one to help you. I still have not received any help. The hacker that hacked my account is still contacting my former followers and is scamming them (some successfully). For some people this app was and is a lively hood.My own name and reputation has been tarnished because of IGs lack of customer service and attention to its own faithful users
"Stopped From Viewing Stories. I follow all sorts of influencer accounts, used to watch my favourite influencers stories everyday with no problems. For some reason now Im no longer able to see her stories or highlights at all. If I switch to my business account I can watch them on there but I dont want to do that on my business account, thats why I have a personal account. Ive reported the problem to Instagram several times, tried to get in touch with them and no joy whatsoever. A few other people have commented on her posts saying theyre having a similar problem? Please sort it Instagram"
"HACKED ACCOUNT. @instagram need a better Help center section for people who need to recover their hacked account. @instagram should provide a phone number or live chat option so we can contact someone immediately before the hacker scam more of our friends, family, and business partners. I am very disappointed with how little help is available for those who experienced password change, email change, and phone number changed due to being hacked. We have been emailing instagram and filling out the form and we have yet to hear back from anyone"
"Profile section is inoperable. Hello, For months now I cannot access the profile section of my Instagram page. Everytime I tried, the whole screen goes black and I cannot do anything on the app. I had to kill app then  relaunch it before I could access other areas except the profile/setting section. Is this a bug or what? Right now I cannot change any of my privacy setting because I cannot access the area.  I have tried deleting the app and re-downloading from App Store but the problem continues. Please sort it out. Thanks"
"Bugs on Iphone. Hi, after more than 3 month of adding new features, i dont have reals option or other direct massage options, included Ive realized that use less cellular data doesnt work too I dont check instagram app constantly but it used 35gig of data just in a weekAll of these problems seems so annoying"
"Up your security. My friend got hacked and cant get her account back. She has tried to contact instagram but nothing. They are saying that she was a fake but I literally have our old messages to prove it. I cant report the account either to try to get it taken down. Up your game instagram. She stop using it sense she cant get her account back because she upset because it had all lot of memories of her uncle who sadly passed away. And the only people that knew her password was me and her, so instagram allowed it to happen"
Love this app. For personal and business use
This is how instagram force you stay on their platform. Not being able to disable my account is unacceptable once a week is absolutely absurd this function is not right at all  due to you privacy concerns you should be able to disable your account when ever and as many times as you like and just not once a week like Facebook and if you dont feel safe and you want to keep disabling you not aloud This is pathetic you cant force people to stay on if they dont want or dont feel safe to do so or they want to take a break this so show you force people to stay on your platform even if they dont want to and the fact that you have to log in on your browser to find the disabled button is just super dodgy you want to make it as hard as possible for people to disable their account this option should amd needs to be on the app and also needs to be able to do that as many time as you like
Hacked. Someone from russia hacked my account and Instagram doesnt help me
"Deleted my account. Ive owned Instagram since the beginning and never had any issues, after I tried logging in once and they said my account had been disabled without warning and therefore it was under review, 24 hours later they tell me my account has been deleted for violating their terms even tho I had never done anything wrong and the account was just used for following 800+ personal people in my life, no email. No warnings. They didnt even tell me what part of their terms I breached, it was even linked with my personal Facebook account and was just deleted. Cheers Instagram "
"Instagram loading. My Instagram never did this but for some reason it is just loading and I restarted my phone. I thought somebody hacked it, but I ended up changing my password and it is still happening. Im confused and I still dont know what to do"
Doesnt allow story sharing. My app has a glitch. Missing the allow resharing to stories in privacy settings. Others cannot share my stories because of this
"No Customer Service. Ive been using Instagram for at least 8-9 years and had over 1500 posts. Someone hacked my account and deleted everything and I have no options to try and restore it. IG does not have a customer service department to assist. I never received a single notification from IG notifying me that someone was trying to login into my account from a new device, no follow-up whatsoever or safety measures So now I have lost my handle and cannot create a new account because it says my phone number and email are already in use. And guess what? Yup, theres NO CUSTOMER SERVICE to ask for help"
Public:private. Can you PUH-lease make an option to have posts be viewable public or private or friends of friends or friends only or just Me like Facebook has their posts? I want my account private but I want some posts to be public sometimes. Then people can subscribe/follow and not be friends
"Instagram has added more ads on your timeline. Scrolling through your timeline on Instagram and you will notice something very quick, an ad after every two pictures. This is incredible. I understand you need to advertise but there comes a point where the platform almost become unbearable"
Instagram wont get me my hacked account back. My account has been hacked and Instagram is doing nothing to help me Someone has hacked into my account changed my username password and email address to theres. It was a private account and now this hacker has all my personal photos Instagram has not replied to my emails
"nobody asked for this. obviously, the removal of chronological order was never asked for. now on top of this, I cant continue to scroll past what are deemed most recent posts without Instagram switching to a suggested feed. I have an explore page for that, not my personal feed where I want to see the posts of everyone I follow. I miss the old layout, where everything wasnt so heavily influenced by algorithms"
"Weird bug. Ive had instagram for years, and i have a main and a spam account and on my spam i hat all the new updates but in my personal i cant. im not able to interact with stories or repost things. i dont know why. ive logged out and back in and deleted the app multiple times. im getting ready to just get rid of the app all together. PLEASE FIX THIS INSTAGRAM"
Not sure if its my data plan but doesnt seem to work well off WiFi. Not sure why but it tells me I need a WiFi connection to post short clips and whatnot when Im outside off my home WiFi. Its a constant issue. And when I do get home. Everything starts posting in a random order
Mark and Ig have not integrity. Mark zuck has shown the world you can make billions from stealing others ideas. ASK APP NOT TO TRACK
"Awesome but has been glitching lately. I have been using Instagram well over 8 years, but recently I have been having trouble accessing my profile. When I click on my person at the bottom my screen blacks out and nothing comes up Ive reinstalled, uninstalled, reset info all of it, I dont know what else to do"
Security codes. Ive been hacked on my main account so I ended up making another and instagram randomly logged me out of that one and now I cant log back in no matter what I do. I tried logging back in and it keeps asking me to put in a security code that they fail to send to my phone number its incredibly frustrating not being able to use my new personal account
My account has been hacked. My account has been hacked & email changed & has all my kids baby pics on there. And Instagram hasnt done anything to help me
Hacker alert be safe. Needs better security some hacker got into my bfs account and got his email and all his info and the hacks trying to make me pay him to give it back step it up instagram
"Non-Close Friends Alerted for Close Friends Stories. Often when I post a story to close friends, non close friends are notified as if Ive posted a public story, then when they tap on my profile, they get a screen saying this story is no longer availableThis is a big problem and an invasion of privacy as people can see when Im posting on close friends. The issue is random but happens very often and appears to potentially be when a user multi-select images to story. This should be resolved as soon as possible"
Cant log on. For almost 2 years now My Instagram hasnt allowed me to log onto any accounts. It continuously says Error Sorry there was a problem with your request. I have the correct information yet it still denies me access. Ive emailed Instagram about the problem more than a few times and they say its solved when its not. Im furious beyond belief
"Instagram 3/2020. The app is glitchy, accounts are constantly hacked a bunch on spam account DMing me a bunch of links that want my password, not a good experience. - every message I get from anyone I need to question if its spam or not"
"Updates didnt make it better. Like other reviews say, Ive had issues with the app not loading, whether Im on cell data or WiFi. Stories take forever to load, only ~5 posts load before I get the cannot refresh feed message, and videos dont load within my feed. Its aggravating, but at least Im not wasting time on my phone as much. I tried deleting and reinstalling, logging back in, and updating the app, and nothing is working. No other apps on my phone are having this issue; instagram is the problem child"
Best yet. I use Instagram for several business and a few personal pages. Absolutely the best. If you are an artist or photographer it has NO equal. It can show your breath of work in seconds and show a potential client that you do amazing work. Thanks
"I wish. I enjoy the app for sharing foodie ideas and art, but I also like my close friends pages. The algorithm seems to prioritize big accounts over personal ones. I wish there were a way for users to prioritize posts from a list so that preferred new ones will always pop up first on your feed. And I still cant get that close friends thing to work. Dont care, though. What I do care about is not having to click on peoples pages one by one just to see what the algorithm missed. Otherwise you run the risk of looking like you ghosted their account. Uncool"
A few request. Why am I unable to edit my profile?? Ive logged out and logged back in Allow for a chronologically feed view. Multiple hashtag search would really help Individual photo privacy or public option
"Report system is subpar. Especially regarding people under 13. Ive seen kids around 10 on here and I cant report them because I dont know their legal name or date of birth, but they have their age in their bio. You shouldnt have to know these things to report a childs account. Just because they arent stupid enough to give out personal information doesnt mean they should be able to be on the internet. I recommend fixing this as soon as possible"
Faulty. Instagram is trying to delete my account because of copyright that I dont even know of ? I only post my personal pictures and never videos or reels . My account is be threatened to be deleted and Im furious
DELETING BECAUSE NEW TERMS & CONDITIONS. The new t&amp;cs are an extreme violation of privacy They are able to spy on people through the front camera amongst other things. Absolutely disturbing. If you must use the app I recommend to use it on your computer
"Action Blocked. Overall, I am happy with this app and I love to use it. Recently I have been getting action blocked multiple times a week for no reason. I do not buy followers, hack, spam, or post inappropriate content. I really hope Instagram fixes this problem ASAP"
"Locked out. Instagram locked me out of my personal account , and professional account due to suspicious activity. I no longer have access to the email I originally signed up with and there is no way to get touch with them. Is there any other social media site like Instagram but actually has customer service ?"
"Annoying. IG has too many ads and suggestions , plus they sell a ridiculous amount of your user data"
"All Spam Bots and Repetitive Accounts. Instagram, you guys used to be great but your platform has turned into nothing but wanna-be business advertisement pages of influencers, that all have 100 spam bots trying to sell get rich quick schemes...and there seems to be NO slowing down of it after all this time. App is really starting to go down hill"
Its good. I like this app but be careful make sure to put privacy mode on it because I actually had someone ask me questions like send a family photo whats your mobile number so be careful
FIX SPAM FILTER. My brand is called @blade.us AND I CANT tag my brand in my bio on my personal page because INSTAGRAM marks it as spam. It says challenge required. started happening with the new update. Had no problems prior. Really frustrating was locked out of my account for a week until I realized what the issue was
You can't censor me into silence. In 2021 it should mandatory in every constitution that everyone must stand up for human rights. This app censors it&#39;s users so that the image of Israel isn&#39;t tarnished. It calls into question every aspect of their data collection. Keep the oppressed in your prayers. This company is heartless
"The latest update is the last straw. I dont ever write reviews, but i literally went out of my way and searched the app just to write this one. Why would a photo sharing app replace the notification section with a shopping tab? This is ridiculous. Theyve put marketing and advertising over functionality and ultimately the experience is ruined. There is too much going on and at this point is really hard to navigate through when you just want to post a simple picture"
Reels hasnt rolled out on my business account. Ive tried to contact Instagram without any luck. Its been almost a year of waiting and Reels hasnt rolled out on my business account despite being available to similar accounts and other business owners. The fact that the algorithm now priorities Reels is really frustrating when I dont have access to it and my small business relies on my content being seen
"I literally got banned for no reason. So my account @chriiis1201 got completely banned out of no where, without warning, and without sending me a email as to why my account was banned. I have not been able to access my account for days now and every time i log in, all it says is thanks for providing your info; well review your info and if we can confirm it, youll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours. It has been more than 24 hours and i have still not received a email telling me why i was banned. On top of that, i went to the Instagram website to try to appeal my ban and surprising, THE APPEAL DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE OF COVID which honestly that is a complete lie coming from a multi million dollar company"
"Lovely Peaches. I love Instagram but Instagram seems to be doing a horrible job with these serious issues. Users like Lovely Peaches need to be taken off of internet or have their accs taken down permanently. Shes flashing at minors (Ski Jackson and Mali), eating her own poop and period blood, and asking people to dox Charli Demaleos personal info, and has done many disturbing things with minors. Her behavior has made Instagramers very uncomfortable. Please take down her acc"
wont let me login. i have 2 accounts on instagram and i can only log into one of them. i kept putting in all the right info and checked my wifi and it still says feedback required its pissing me off because i tried to change my password as well and it said feedback required. i tried to fix this for about 10 minutes but overall the app is great to make friends and socialize with things you like
". Instagram I speak to you in the most serious way possible, my love Kim jisoo wanted to upload 3 photos in her personal account of ig and it turns out that she could not and had to delete them, she got sad and had to apologize in her stories, so OR YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM OR WE DON&#39;T FIX THEM TO PIJASOS  BECAUSE I CAN&#39;T STAND TO SEE MY BB JISOO SAD .  thanks for your attention: D"
"My personal experience. A great platform for social exposure, an amazing medium for public interactionsThis app has literally changed my world, my work has started to get an uptick, cliental development, more than anything the feature being so user friendly and easy access to the global arena makes it even more betterMy genre of work is connecting me to my clan through this mediumAlso coming to the services the help desk is a great feature and absolutely safe.. Coming from my personal experience my job profile is as such that I have to conduct live sessions where I, at times come across wired trollers, but thanks to instagram its a very easy procedure to block or report the comment and they take action in literally secondsThank you instagram your true follower Amrita Maitra"
The Free Thinker.101. Owned by FB. Will censure free thought. Hates conservative personal liberty personal responsibility individuals
"They stole my first account. My first account was stolen- the people who stole it wanted money from me to restore it. I asked help to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter- no one helped , no one replied to my messages or emails I lost my account and pictures. I am retrying but this will be the last time"
Not happy with new update. I have two profiles one is my personal the other is for photography and on my photography profile you put a stupid reels button where the compose photo button used to be I dont want reels I came to Instagram to take photos and view them not watch stupid videos please fix and put it back or let me at least customize to the way I like it
HACKED. Instagram gets a low rating for me. My account was hacked when my phone was stolen. The person changed the phone number and the email. The only option Instagram gives you to recover your hacked account is to put in a email or phone number. But how can I put in my email or phone number when my account has been hacked and information changed? Now this person is using my account with my picture and my name. I have no way to recover my account I feel that this is a problem area that Instagram needs to fix. For example when trying to recover your hacked account Instagram should ask you what was the very first email you used to make your account. That way a person will be able to recover their recount no matter who hacked it. Im very angry I worked hard to get to where I was. I feel that if Instagram works hard to get a celebrities account back Instagram should work twice as hard for a normal person to get their account recovered being hacked
"My account got hacked. i love this app. and continue to use it everyday because it isnt as negative as facebook and tiktok can be. BUT. I have much evidence to prove my hacked account is mine, and they(hacker) arent using my account anymore since its been months.I have tried countless times to get a hold of Instagram. Nothing. not possible. I tried sending email. i looked for a phone number. that all lead back to the help centre. I know it is possible for instagram to give my account back to me, but no one, only the help centre. :("
Two faults. Instagram is a great app however I have found to faults that annoy me greatly.The first one is not being able to see who saved your posts- I understand that it is to protect peoples privacy however it concerns me and I dont feel safe knowing that it could be some random person who saved it. The second fault is just an annoying one- when your are on the discover mode and you accidentally swipe right you are back to the home page- it would be great if after accidentally doing that you could swipe left to return to the post you were looking at. If the Instagram creators would include theses changes in the next major updates it would be great 
"No Help. My account got hacked, after at least an hour of searching. I scoured instagram help and nothing useful. I had to create a brand new account and use the app to report it. It's been 24 hours and some dude is still posting scams with my face on them"
Suggested posts are awful. The newest update ruined the app completely for me. Its all ads and people I dont follow. Zero personal connection to my feed
Profile Page won't show up always shows a black screen. Every time I&#39;m on Instagram I can never go on my personal page if I press the page icon it&#39;s goes straight black screen every single time i can&#39;t go to my settings or see my archive stories or saved posts I can&#39;t doing anything but look at my new feeds I have a iPhone 7plus with the lastest iOS software I never had this problem before but it&#39;s been going on for weeks maybe months now
Ignores privacy settings BEWARE. Keeps accessing my contacts even though I have set to not allow it
"Hacked. Ive been using Instagram since for a few months(I got it last summer) and havent ran into any major problems while using it. However, Ive noticed that many people, including myself, have been getting hacked by people/bots. Like today, I got on Instagram to see that I had sent some type of message to over 15 people which was basically just some link that didnt even work, I dont know how it happened but it did. Since then I havent been able to see if people are active or not and people can no longer see if Im active. This has happened to many people and its pretty stupid.P.S: My account is verified under my email and my phone number, so Im just trying to understand how I got hacked"
"Someone made a duplicate account. Im so angry, a person stole my Facebook pics made an account with my name and has followers and follows people This is a deep violation of my privacy and using my images without my permission I reported it to Instagram no removal for days now This is serious this person went from Facebook to IG and made an account while my real account doesnt use my name How the heck do I get rid of that other account????? Why doesnt anyone fix this its not a joke and I plan on getting a lawyer involved there was theft on Facebook and my real name was taken to make a separate account with followers I emailed dozens of times with no response its disgusting get rid of the fake page now"
Sharing options constantly not working. Currently my settings in privacy the option to allow others to share is missing. Constantly having other options for sharing coming and going. Instagram not providing a consistent platform
"Instagram features. So recently Ive noticed new features come out on Instagram (theyre new for the Uk version) and to be fair it would be a lot better if you gave us options to turn some of these features on or off. My personal issue is if we tap on a video to mute or unmute it we just see a bigger version of the video which is really irritating because I dont care about it. Its such a useless feature because who on earth is going to watch it in that format?Oh another things, for the UK the Instagram DMs still dont have the coloured text box option for a lot of us. And i dont like the bland DMs"
"Horrible New Features. Instagram completely took out your notification tab, instead replacing it with a shop to try and sell you low-effort goods"
Why spying?. Im very disappointed to delete the app for making me feel insecure
"New update doesnt work. Since updating the app to the latest version, the instagram app doesnt work or load unless im on wifi. although i have Cellular data and before the update would work perfectly fine without wifi  all the other apps on my phone work on cellular data except this one. hoping they fix this issue"
Love Instagram. I love Instagram and have x2 business accounts as well as a personal account. Only my personal account has the option to add music which is really annoying as I use stories more through my business accounts. Please help and make it possible that music and dm options are available throughout the accounts Thanks 
"Online resource. IG is been a great online resource for sharing and connecting with the world. I started to use it with a personal account, then added a few others for commukity building and now a business one. Thanks IG"
"Give me my chronological feed back. This used to be one of my favorite apps. However, now the algorithms for my feed annoy me. I miss things from people I didnt even know still posted because I dont interact with them enough. Also I absolutely hate the suggested post in my main feed. Thats for my personal followings. Leave that in the explore feed. Algorithms are ruining this app"
Works okay. But spies on you and shows you A lot of ads
"Not satisfied with how my company is treated on Instagram. Hi Instagram family, I love this app but unfortunately I think my company is being treated unfairly. There are so many fake boutiques and even real companies that steals our pictures and also scam our customers. Every time we report them Instagram does nothing or tells us they dont see a problem. It hurts my heart. I even tried to verify my business page so that will help people to understand that we are the real boutique. Again Instagram has turned us down. I started this boutique with nothing but a few doll and a dream. I built it from the ground up. Every day I see so many people stealing my pics and removing our watermark then post them as their own. I feel helpless. Even in advertising on Instagram I see my competition selling same and similar items even the people that steals our pictures are able to advertise our pics yet so many of my advertisements have been rejected. I dont know how we can fix this and why my company is being treated the way we are. We are the original. My model works for our company only. She too is so tired of people stealing our pics and the Chinese companies photoshop other clothing on to her and sometimes make her look deformed. Even remove her head and put other heads on her body the stuff happening to us is very bad. Please help us. My name is Vicky Lindo contact number 9129964459. Thank you "
Bad privacy. Why everyone can hack my page?You must make a password that open the page by see the Real user of the page Like when the phone open with face
"Fun and no pressure. I was hesitant initially, but I like the privacy and not feeling obligated to post or comment"
Instagram. People trying to steal accounts for Instagram private to rise nope I cant login put extra password wont let me change it people trying to steal people cant I hate that
My Instagram account is hacked. Someone else is taking over my Instagram account please help
New Changes for European users?. The new changes completely ruin users experience. The private chat gallery has been completely removed (please bring this back). What privacy laws involve getting rid of the memories shared with your friends and family??? Now European users arent even able to directly dm and share a reel...this has nothing to do with the new laws but somehow it has been put in place. Please FIX this
downloading. On my brother phone he deleted instgram he tried to download it back and its asking him for his billing information
"Deleted my original instagram. I have had Instagram for several years now with so many pictures and memories which were erased because my account was deactivated. I tried to remove my DOB on Facebook so it wasnt public and it was deactivated. I appealed with Facebook and it was approved but Instagram has no customer service and I had no choice but to create a new account. They didnt communicate or approve anything when I tried to appeal, no where to upload my drivers license. My old account still shows up for people so they think the my new account is a hack. Beyond disappointing they dont have a better means of communicating issues like this"
Please help. My account has been hacked and I have no way of getting back in and this hacker changed my password and email and Instagram IS ZERO HELP.  I think I could get the president on the phone easier than IG non existent customer service. I cant delete my account. This is the worst social media app and I just need to log back in so I can delete the stupid spying app off my phone
LAG. My instagram is always lagging  Ill be otp wit somebody on insta and then it freezes and just lags or Ill be trying to take a picture an it lags so bad and I have Iphone so the problem isnt my phone  I dont k ow how many times Ive deleted and got back instagram to see if itll stop but it doesnt and points its not lagging at all but half the time it is 
"Cant believe Instagram is limiting posts on Palestine. I am going to give a one star rating to Instagram because they have been limiting posts that include information on the oppression, suppression &amp; ethnic cleansing of Palestinian children, women and men. Instagram has also been deleting peoples accounts if they have had a large number of followers- those people were posting stories &amp; information on the plight of the Palestinians and their personal account was deleted by Instagram"
"Careful with adds its practically phishing. Allowing advertisement that phishing the data from account owners is unacceptable.I followed then link in one add thinking that its trustful and now my name, email and phone number are compromised. Im getting hundreds of scam emails and have no even chance to complain. Where is you support, phone number or something. Now when I decided to delete my account I cant even do that. Seems like there is no such an option. Shame on you, disgusting"
Instagram text update. This seems to be the only way folks have gotten a response back from IG so trying here. I run a creator account as well as a personal account and a business account. My business and personal account both have the Instagram update with new text but for some reason its been MONTH and I cant get the new text on my creator account... what gives? As a content creator its really disappointing not having these new features. My IG claims its up to date as well and in version 166.1
I got hacked. I got hacked and they changed my email and phone number without consulting me at all and Instagram has been absolutely no help they cant even send me a simple code and tell me to wait a few minutes and try again before sending the same message consecutively. For such a big app they offer absolutely no help
"Very Disappointed, couldnt make account. Couldnt make account.So I finally decided to get an instagram account, and am at the point in making one where you choose your username so I pick one thats not taken, then I get a pop up saying theres an error, Im like k,someone probably just chose it at the same time as me or something so i enter a new one, then it says my accounts been deactivated and kicks me out to the sign in screen?I try to sign in with my email and password and it just says its been disabled for breaching their terms of service? I havent even been able to use it yet, how in the world have i breached terms of service?They have a link that says if we made a mistake let us know at the bottom ofthe accounts disabled thing,Clicked it, filled out information, had to try and figure out which username was the one that worked.Got an email after asking me to send a photo of myself with a number code they provided, my full name and username to prove I own the account  I did so, even though I felt very uncomfortable in doing so and have yet to get a response back that the accounts been enabledThis is NOT a good way to treat first time users, all i wanted to do was post  pics of the mediocre art i make online not send MY picture to some company I dont trustEven if my account does get enabled, I think Ill just go back to using Pinterest thanks"
"This App Went Down. Facebook literally ruined this app in so many ways. Not only the features are absolute unnecessary and useless, but yall remove posts that doesnt go against your guidelines at all. People can post animal and child abuse, fights, murder and basically porn and their posts wont ever be taken down as easily as making a statement or personal opinion that isnt hate speech. Its sickening what Facebook did to this app, I cant wait for there to be another app that has no ties to Facebook that takes down both of these garbage apps"
FEEDBACK. I would suggest adding reacts and ways to edit a specific photo out of a post thread. Also would suggest a way to repost content or share content from your friends onto feeds but not on your personal page
Great. The app and data stores so much storage :(
"ok but could be better. overall, instagram is a fantastic app but, there is a few things i would change such as, the livestream story future. While it is incredibly easy to use it&#39;s a little bit glitchy at times. Which is fine but sometimes it can be a bit annoying and i don&#39;t know if this is just a personal problem for me also, something else that REALLY bugs me is if you want to have a aesthetic, you can&#39;t add more than 150 characters.. that&#39;s very very annoying..Anyways, that&#39;s all i have to say about the instagram app and i hope this was helpful"
Too many updates. 11x updates in the last month. Is there really any need? At 151mb that accounts for 1.6gb of my data allowance
Im hacked and same with my followers. Instagram help Im account and my followers account at hacked by spam bots plz save us they might trick my followers
"No care for user feedback or appeals. I have filed a complaints atleast three times through instagrams Report an issue feature. My posts (on stories) are unable to be shared by my friends despite the fact that I tagged them. Also I have double checked my privacy settings to make sure nothing Im doing blocks this. There has been zero response from them and Im still facing the issue. When its my friends bday and we all put posts to wish her, my friend can reshare everyones post but mine. The social impact on my mind is that my friends dont appreciate my post as much (of course until I discovered this bug). Last hope to get this fixed by filing a complaint here"
Help. The all is not loading it hasnt been for a whole day my timeline wont refresh I cant open any stories. I tried changing to my data and it still wont work ask the other apps work except Instagram. Ive tried restarting my phone and deleting and regulating the app but still nothing
"dont care about their users. my friends account got hacked and because she doesnt have 500k followers they wont do anything. some jerk hacked in, changed her account info, blackmailed her and they dont have a system in place to quickly fix this and get her account back. absolutely absurd"
"Decent. I run a personal and business accountEasy to use but the thing im dying for is a upload scheduler i dont always have time to be on myPhone at my followers most active time, let me schedule it"
Problems. My Instagram is not working Nd I have spent time on this app with personal things if it cannot be fixed Im going to have it looked at with my lawyer the app haves bug problems
"Business account cant do paid promotions. Ive used Instagram for my business since 2018 and have never had an issue until now. I have a business account and I have grown organically and never spammed or followed more than maybe one or two accounts a day. Im very selective with photos I like and engage on and its usually only my personally friends accounts. I receive a error message every time I like a friends photo or try to comment on their photos. I cannot follow new accounts or write captions on my own photos or posts. I also cant comment on my own photos. Its been like this for almost THREE weeks straight. I dont want to PAY to PROMOTE my business if I cant include a personal caption. I have deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times, I have the latest update of the app, and Im not sure what to do. Any help or insight would be appreciated"
Checking who saw your video. It would be a little better if you could see who viewed personal videos
"Free speech. Yes, this is a private platform and users agree to the rules set forth by the owner. But prohibiting open and free conversations is detrimental to personal growth"
"My personal account gone. I have a member of Instagram for 8 years.I have disabled my account for a 2 weeks and was about to activated it. Now, everything is. I am not sure if I was hacked or not, but cannot access to my account anymore"
"terrible image quality and messy feed. what happened to the feed?????? i have a post from 14 min ago, one from 4 days ago, one from 2 hours ago, one from 2 days ago. WHAT??? just leave it alonefacebook is the richest social media platform and makes 94% of its money off selling our data to advertisers but when i upload a photo taken on my full frame mirrorless camera they look like they came out of a flip phone because the image quality gets SO watered down. why?? yall have tons of money. just post our images at their real quality. i made sure the images are 1080 pixels and it still looks awful, its like yall are also decreasing the number of colors??? ugh i hate it. so much.ugh. someone PLEASE make a new photo sharing app.also reels are stupid, stop trying to make it a thing. stop copying every single app UGH I HATE FACEBOOK for ruining this app. no wonder the founders quit"
"Ugh. Instagram is great however , Ive been having issues sharing my own post to my story to gain traction &amp; I&#39;ve been reaching out to support for over 4 months and they have not responded not one time . Its really weird because my personal page &amp; other business page works fine . &amp; on top of that my followers cannot share my stories even though my setting are set to allow every one to share . Ive did everything I could think of to no avail"
"Shopgate Update. Latest update is shocking I dont want to shop via Instagram Notifications, Add New and Message belong in the bottom bar, not at the top - think how users actually use their device Give me the option to remove / reconfigure icons. Why remove the ability to resize images? Please reinstate Reels ... Why? To compete wit TikTok? Let the kids use TT and raise the bar a bit ... like IG used to. Your algorithms are rubbish.  Display feeds in chronological orderI have seen some reviewers saying that their multiple accounts have merged ...If you do this to mine, youll lose me.I want my personal and business separate"
Hacked my account. Its crazy how somebody can hack my account text people using my pictures and trying to get people to send them money I reported my page they said they didnt see anything wrong but I keep telling them that my account was hacked they want remove it blocked it or anything so its ok for someone to hacked your account you reporting it and they still want do nothing my family even reporting it and they still want do nothing
"Two factor authentication not working. I deleted and reinstalled Instagram to try and fix a bug that wouldnt let me receive notifications, and it logged me out of my accounts. When I tried to log back into my personal account, it said that I needed to type the 6-digit security code in that the app texted me. So I went to my messages to check, and nothing was there. I waited a few hours, tapped resend code and still nothing. I restarted my phone, my wifi, reinstalled the app again, and gave it another day to send the security code to me, but didnt get one text. I sent an email to customer support, saying that I wasnt getting any texts and they asked me to send a picture of myself holding up a piece of paper with numbers so they could compare it to the picture on my account and authorize me. I sent a photo and havent gotten any email back. I just want to get my photos off of the account"
"Irritated at this point. Normally Instagram is pretty good for me Ive never had any issues. So, decided to make an account for my pup, and it recently got hacked and then I got the account back by myself. And a few days later they deactivated the account saying i was trying to sell things. So Ive done my part to get the account back again but seems like they really dont care to help too much. Hope none of you get hacked because they show no mercy and dont care"
"Log-In Issues and No Help Center. Instagram has no method of reaching out to them and its super frustrating. About half a year ago, a friend of mine had her Instagram account hacked and I temporarily deactivated mine to prevent mine from being hacked too. But I try to log in a week later, go through the steps to reactivate it, verify the account is mine, and I keep getting the same log-in error every time Its a very vague and unhelpful Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again. Ive tried on and off again for MONTHS to reactivate my account. Ive followed the online instructions, have contacted Instagram through their empty phone number, emails, and even reached out to the parent company, Facebook. Nothing works Needles to say, Im never having an Instagram again. They dont care about their users. If they did, they would have a direct help center and wouldnt give you an automated voice message system on their broken phone number. Dont get Instagram and dont make an account. Sure, it looks great and works well for a short amount of time, but you will lose everything because Instagram doesnt care about their users and doesnt fix their problems"
Cant log back in. So Ive tried to change my password in the past and I couldnt because Instagram didnt send a link to my phone number and I dont have a email attached to my account. So I continued trying and it never worked. It wouldnt even let me send a request for help. Now I cant log in to my personal account that has a lot of my pictures and personal information. So Ive made a new account but Im very frustrated with this issue
Privacy. Please fix so that if you have a private account  on followers can join since thats why your account is private anyway
Hacked at 11k and Instagram deleted my account. After years of creating followers base and investing thousands of money and time after my personal account got hacked Facebook decided to delete it. I was using same telephone number for authentication thats why probably it happened. Im not investing even one single penny now. Im taking my business to google now. Thank a lot Mark 
"Treats new accounts like spam. Ive had a personal IG account for years and never had any issues. I started a secondary account for my artwork about a month ago and in the past week, Ive somehow lost the ability to access my account insights and despite reporting it to the help center, I have not regained access. And just tonight, I randomly lost the ability to see any of my DMs. Meanwhile my personal account is still working fine"
Hacked Instagram Account. 3 weeks and still zero response from Instagram regarding my compromised account. Getting my identity proved was useless to me because the hacker put a backup code on my account and added their information and removed mine. My original information is there but I cant gain access. Any suggestions?????
I hate this new version. I do not want to see people I dont know Im going to delete my account if you do not change my privacy
"10000% would NOT recommend. My account was deactivated by Instagram & now theyve essentially ghosted me so I cant get my account back. For the past couple of days (almost a week) I have been trying to log back into my account but Instagram wont send the verification code to my number. Ive tried asking for a new code but it either tells me to wait 60 seconds or connect to the internet and I have done both countless of times. When asking for support i received their automated response the first two days of me trying to gain access to my account but now I have heard a single thing back from them after they told me my account was flagged for going again their terms of use. My account is for personal use and only have a few pictures of me, theres no way I violated their terms of use and Instagram is so unprofessional/ unhelpful that I cant even get a real response as to why my account was flagged or how I can appeal it if I know ive done nothing wrong. DO BETTER. There should be no reason that i might have to make a COMPLETELY NEW account because they decided to deactivate my account then not provide the support they claim to have"
"Pretty great. Instagram gets a bad name because of some of the false people on it, but the app itself is wonderfully made. As long as you use it wisely, the app is fun and an incredible tool"
"Sorry there was a problem with your request. I get this same message everytime I try logging into any Instagram page I own or anybody owns at that. I havent been on Instagram in months through my phone, I literally have to use Safari for the time being since I dont have access to the app. By using a friends phone I can easily log in no problem but my phone it just doesnt work. I need help"
Not working. After I updated my phone my Instagram hasnt let me post any videos and I tried everything and I cant seem to fix it. It keeps giving me Sorry something went wrong please try again later and I have restarted my phone and uninstalled the app and even checked my data and internet connection and still nothing idk
"So many hacked accounts and spam profiles. Its worse than spam emails telling me theres hot Asian women less than a mile away. The worst part is, IG isnt even deleting the accounts. Now theres just a bunch of spam and fakes profiles of my friends trying to get me to turn $300 into $3k "
"Hacked account. Im a 20 yr old barber I rely on my exposure from the app a lot of times for business my account was hacked about 6 days ago the support team has made zero help towards getting my account back Im extremely upset if I cant get my account back Ill mostly likely keep the app deleted  almost 3,000 followers and they will be hacked too if Instagram cant help me get my personal property back"
"Instagram. Ive been locked out of my account for almost a year now, because you all claimed that I shared my password or I shared something that was not within you alls regulations    Its says to change my password, but I dont have that email address or phone number thats attached to that account anymore and it wont allow me to change it or access my account   Now how can you all help me?? I even tried making a new account and it sends me right back to the same info. to change my password"
UPDATES KEEP GETTING WORSE. The new update is so annoying ... I dont go on instagram to shop ... I just want to content from my following without being bombarded by the lousy algorithm (and ads) I cant even find my notifications tab ??? Its getting REALLY annoying to use the app for personal use feels more like business app .......... please just go back
"My gifs wont work :). Ive had Instagram for almost two years and recently my gifs wont load or show up on my stories or in chats, even when they are sent by others. At first I thought it was a WiFi issue but I have this issue no matter if my WiFi and data is on or off. Ive had this issue for about 3 months and I dont know how to fix it or whats wrong :/"
Censorship cant even upload a picture. You cannot even upload a picture unless you grant them access to your microphone. why do they need access to your microphone just to upload a picture that has no sound?they are spying on their customers and lying about it. these criminals must be held accountable Another mass media controls to push hate speechNow they want to Join the CCP and give you a social credit score meaning if you question the Na£I narrative they can remove you and they can continue with the New W0rld order...Wake Up
Show the truth. It is a bad App because he didnt show the rally information
stop tryna spy on me . ik im a bad bish but like dayum why you wanna track my life insta 
"Good platform, but. Way too many spam accounts. Has created an unbearable experience being inundated with porn and bitcoin accounts. Had to close down my public account in favour of a private one. Very frustrating. Also, being part of the FB ecosystem now comes with constant reminders that you are part of the FB ecosystem"
STILL HAVENT RECIEVED SUPPORT. Unfortunately I still have not received any support from Instagram after countless attempts to sort out a problem with my account. For some reason the add post to your story button does not show up for my business account but does for my personal account on the same device This is an extremely annoying bug and no doubt a quick fix if I could get anybody attention 1 Star until I can get it fixed 
Hacked and deleted. This is my second personal Instagram account that I have made and has gotten hacked and deleted for whatever reasons I do not know I have personal family photos on it and I would like to get them retrieved... I believe someone is falsely reporting me... my first account was username Joey_puccio and my new account that I had made up 4 months ago username:Joeypuccio my E-mail account for both is joeyp451@aol.command my cell # is 917-517-6021 Can I please have both accounts reactivated so I can get my personal family photos thank you
"Horrible app. Very censored, had 3 accounts token down for no reason. Always lags, Instagram way or no way. They are very one track minded and platform is terrible"
"Spam & Messaging-Needs Improvement. PLZ DONT MAKE MSG INBOX OF UNREAD ONLY GO BACK 30 DAYS I have much more unreads to go throughThankfully I recently figured out that I can pin important messages in my IG *inbox*. Lets face it, whether ambassador or not, influencer or not its more efficient to be able to organize any inbox Previously I had a lot of unread messages that were grouped w/already replied ones It was driving me bonkers For people w/biz pgs I can imagine theyd like such efficiency as well. It is beyond annoying to have to go through &amp; constantly block sex *spam* and or phishing profiles Every story I post there are accounts that are complete spam W/just a booty pic, no friends, followers or posts. IG needs to improve a spam blocker fire wall or something This goes along w/privacy &amp; security. Barely this year I made my IG public again due to having to get a restraining order on a guy. Who knows, he could be creating a fake acct as a chick just to be able to see my profile. PLZ fix this ASAP. Regarding *editing profiles* I joined the IG fam in 2017, most for biz &amp; networking connections. That being said, it would be great if there was more flexibility in creating an IG title. Besides blogger, model &amp; athlete &amp; investor. Or at least being able to have less of a cap on the word count"
"The direction this app is going. I am saddened that not only has this app made itself more of a shopping experience than a social one, but that they are policing and censoring womens bodies making it impossible for SW to advertise themselves and make a living. Also major privacy issues"
"Horrible. This app is absolutely terrible. I had a previous account years ago that ended up getting hacked. I reported it before I found out that there was another way to get my account back. But then, the hacked account was shut down. Even now, I still try to make a new account with different emails and different phone numbers. But it still says EVERY SINGLE TIME that my account has been disabled for violating their terms. It frustrates me so much, and I still dont understand why I cant make a new account after changing everything. If Instagram support could actually help me for once, itd be a miracle"
Propagand. Censoring Palestine data Absolute joke of an app
"Cant update my settings. Im unable to change my profile picture, update my bio or change my privacy settings. Its been like this for a while now and Ive tried logging out and in again. Ive tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. None of which have worked. Just sort it out"
"broken. In top of not seeing peoples likes, you cant see people&#39;s activity which i found useful. AN D i can&#39;t like posts anymore. Everytime i try it just says &#34;action blocked&#34; and i dont know why. I tried closing the app, restarting my phone, but it still doesn&#39;t work. Not only that instagram frequently logs me out of my accounts and when i log back in i cant do anything. Instagram tells me i have no internet when i do, i try with my data and itstill  doesn&#39;t work. Although there are many issues and aspects that i dont lile from instagram, i love using the app. It&#39;s still good for talking to others especially during quarantine. I just wished they would fix their app"
Instagram app. Its been 3 months now that Im unable to use the mobile app I try to log back in and it keep saying unable to log back in Im able to access my account through the web but not the mobile app
"Censorship Problems. Apparently you have to be on a certain side to not get posts deleted or your account deleted. People are not allowed to stand up for human rights. We are being silenced from speaking up for the oppressed. Hashtags are being blocked. Its not a crime to stand up against oppression. I stand with Palestine. That means I stand with humans who are Muslim, Christian, and Jewish (and everything else) who happen to be oppressed by Zionists. People are being silenced for being on the right side on history. If Mark wants to create (or buy) social media platforms for all to use, he needs to put his personal interests aside and let it be for everyone"
Disabled my account. Instagram disabled my account without a warning and now I cant even request a review even after 24 hours have passed since I gave the information and followed the steps. I had that account since 4 years and its very daunting and disheartening to see how my memories have been taken away all of a sudden and I cant even download the data. I am just not being given that option
"Full of glitches. The latest update is full of glitches. Notifications arent showing and feed isnt being updated properly. Pictures are taking forever to load which takes me back to days of good ole dial-up. Web version is better but the phone one is just about unusable.Also, just because you put the shopping button where notifications button used to be, doesnt mean Ill ever buy anything through instagram.  Youre changing things just for the sake of changing yet accomplishing nothing but havinh an app full of bugs"
Fix this app . Instagram is completely broken I cannot click on it every Time I click on the app everything is black and it acts like its loading Ive let it load for 2 in a half hours and its still black Ive deleted and reinstalled the app 3 times my wifi and data is on I dont know what else to do
Absolutely disappointing. My account has been hacked with all my customers and informations and  Instagram doesnt do nothing about it
"Account disabled. I love instagram with all I have, however, my personal account was disabled due to violating terms which I havent done so I am hoping to get my personal account back"
Too many fking ads. Ads are fair enough but there are way too many and not enough privacy measures
"Great but. If youre gonna scan my data and give me ads, at least do it right and stop giving me stuff Im not interested in.On a further point if I hide an add I think it would be helpful if I could say Im not interested is why I hid it"
Old instagram. The old version of instagram was much better and thats why it was better to have both a personal feed and a explore page. I want that back and so does everyone else Im almost positive
Instagram page hacked. I have been trying for over a week to have someone close my Instagram account  dsherrillprettygirl..my account has been hacked by someone pretending to b me..they r reaching out to people I'm following..they r asking for their cash app tag.. and also using Bitcoin to get money. Please help me and close this account
"to the all sleeping instagram Customer service. My Instgram has been disabled since october 31/2020 for no reason probabley by mistake.I have tried many ways to get my instgram account back, requested through email including all my required information via my own pictures, but still did not get any respond or no further information yet.  what shuold i do to get it back??????????????????????Username : harem8_"
"Good buuuuut. I love Instagram, mostly for chatting to people, I just think that its sad that you cant access past messages easy, I have a chat with a friend with so much history in it and Id love to go through to the end, but theres so much it took two hours to get to last months messages. Now its more of a personal problem, but it got me thinking to suggest a possible thing to help access old messages for memories.Idk this was just what was on my own but I do love Instagram for what it is"
"A blessing in my life. Its only my favourite online thing ever. My Instagram is a temple of me It helped me a lot with my self esteem, and personal growth. Love"
Hi its autum. It keeps saying I have notifications on Instagram but I dont and its really annoying so please fix it. I loved the app when it didnt do all this stuff but now its kinda of annoying With all the notifications for the update I wish you would just go back to how it was not like when I was first made like to run it was good updated by with all these updates of all the spam notifications its really annoying because I have like it says I have 10 messages and then I look and I dont
"Surely time for an iPad version. Ive been using Instagram for a while on a personal basis, but have recently had to create another account for business purposes. Those posts tend to be a little longer with more tags and hyperlinks. Using a phones keyboard is tortuous, as is having to use an iPad in portrait. Surely its time to have a proper tablet version of the app?"
IPhone 11Pro Version Is bad. When are you going to update the App so you can have more than one account on the same phone I use two for business as well as a personal one and since upgrading my phone it wont work  Come on Instagram
Instagram music. I have two accounts in instagram one is for business. I have the music sticker at my personal account and I dont have any at my business one. I cannot post stories with music for promotion. Why????
Stop with these errors. So I deleted my Instagram app cause it was glitchy and I download it back and it keeps saying error check internet connection and try again later and my internet is working well its strong data right now and it keeps on saying error so please fix your app
"Update suggestions. 1. It used to be easier to add stories, itll be great to get back to that2. Itll be great to know when someone screenrecords or screenshot our stories (for privacy reasons)"
"Terrible app. Im writing this to bring the entire Facebook family of apps down in ratings.  These apps are toxic to democracy, they steal and sell an enormous amount of data about users and they allow for the amplification and magnification of misinformation and falsehoods.  I killed my IG a year ago and it was the best thing Ive ever done for my mental health.  Stay away  And FYI, yeah, Zuckerberg is truly a soulless monster"
"Ads are out of control. It was one thing to see an ad every once in awhile but I now see one after every other post and for things that I personal dont have any interest in such as guns. After the past few days, I have considered deleting the app just from how frustrated I am with the main feed. Im fearful of liking posts in fear its an ad and will keep showing up. I hope Facebook/Instagram can get this forfeited out soon"
No option to add music to stories. I can add music to my personal stories but my business page doesnt have the option? Whats going on Instagram?
"hate the new music update. so i was a business account right, which i only used to see insights, nothing else- and the music option got taken away because instagram thinks im using the music for commercial purposes, which isnt true. so i tried to switch to a personal account to see if it would change, and no, it doesnt. now im stuck with royalty free music that no one knows about and im stuck not being able to post any music on my story anymore. instagram, literally fix your stuff. after each update the app gets worse and worse. why introduce the music aspect of the app if we cant even use it. thanks. -angry reviewer"
"Needs fixing. Not sure why its happening but my account follows random accounts everyday. No apps have access or permission, its not hacked. Changed password, 2 authentications required. Messaged Instagram multiple times with no response and no fix. Otherwise Id give it 5 stars. Not sure how else to fix. Ive tried everything"
"Unable to find my account. Horrible service I have a business account, I went to check it aside frm my personal account and it was fine during the daylate night I see Ive been logged out, I get a message asking to confirm its me and not a robot because they found suspicious activity I check tht Im not a robot, I send the confirmation code sent to my phone all waiting to access my account and I get a message on the login page saying THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING YOUR INFO We'll review your info and if we can confirm it, you'll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours.WHATS GOING ON INSTAGRAM I didnt violate any community guidelines nor was given any explanation as to why my account is all of a sudden missing. Reinstate my account, thank you"
"Help. My instagram is no internet connection see but I have WiFi and data .login is error signup with no face book .why ?I dont understand. help me please ,i English language is bad .you dont fair understand but help me"
"Sharing a private account post. Thanks, IG, for protecting my friends privacy by no longer telling me if my friends follow a private account or not Super helpful, as now each share in a DM is a total dice roll. Really appreciate how you tell me its a private account though...lets me know my odds might be lower in the DM share. Brilliant"
"Instagram stories dont load up. I have 3 accounts on my Instagram business, blog account and personal accountThe stories all show up on my business and blog account but not my personal account it just shows a black screen with an arrow on. This is after update"
"Personal profile on IG going BLack screen with no access to personal profile. I actually stopped using Instagram since high school. That was 2012 when I graduated.  But even though I dont use it its still useful to me and my favorite social media app. BUT ever since I updated my phone to iOS13.4.1 it has been acting a little weird. As far as I know everything on the Instagram app works perfectly fine. But when I click on the one area that brings you to your profile, my screen literally goes BLACK and stays that way. And I lose function of the app. I have to force close the app just to get back on it and be able to use it. PLEASE HELP  Ill never take Instagram for granted again lol"
stupid update. why did instagram replace my notifications with a shipping tab isnt this a photo sharing app this is annoying
"Love it but its been glitchy. I love Instagramits probably my favorite social media platform. I use it for my personal life, I have a business account and even a meme account I love all of the features it has; especially adding music to your story. But lately, its been struggling to load the music on my personal account. I have to sit and wait 10+ minutes just to listen the song to see if its the one I want to add. On my business account, I cant get the music to work at all. I havent tried on my meme account. I close the app, Ive updated it, uninstalled and reinstalled it but nothing seems to work. Another thing is, the past month or so, Instagram keeps saying that I have no internet connection and wont load anything for hours, when my service is just fine. I dont know if its just my accounts or if others are dealing with this too but its quite frustrating; especially when trying to run a business over Instagram"
"Instagram issues. My personal account is missing Deezignlv333 Ive been trying for three weeks to get it back. Im beyond frustratedWe report it, but it goes nowhere. Ugh Dee Mangino-Sullivan"
"Love and love not so much. I love the posting and the personal portion of Instagram. However, the suggested posts are not great. They arent interest of mine. Theyre just boring people who are gram famous. And the reels are my least favorite because they are all the same The same sound and the same filters/games. I need more variety/more interesting stuff"
Hi. This is my personal Instagram account i am not getting the option of Instagram reels in my account so please enable Instagram reels option in my account
"This app used to be something. This app has been ruined by Facebook... its got worse since they swooped in... most recently , why have they stripped the chat features out of the UK version when we wont be in the EU for longer than 2 weeks and so not subject to the EU privacy laws??? Utterly utterly Ridiculous. Bring back song stickers for stories for a start. Seriously considering deleting. Utter pants"
Share to my story doesnt work. Ive tried to enable the feature many times in my privacy settings but I just dont have the feature. Very frustrating
"Updates not on my profile. I use IG a lot and I manage a few different profiles but for some reason whenever there is a new feature on the app like the 30 second reel for example my personal profile is the only one that doesnt receive the update. Its quite annoying as it is very limiting in what I can do. Another example, my other profiles had the option of adding music lyrics to ig stories and I didnt get that option on my personal profile till a year later. Still currently waiting to have that 30 sec reel option"
"Just came off Instagram. I have had enough now, I have encountered too many situations where my accounts are getting hacked into. I have deleted my account and will never be returning to Instagram againI have constantly reported safety concerns to the support people and surprise surprise they are as useless as alwaysIf anyone from the company of Instagram even bothers to read this review, make sure that there are more privacy things in place for accounts to be safe away from hackers There are too many people hacking accounts just because they are very bored and have nothing better to do in life, Instagram would be better if it was saferFrom a business point of view, it&#39;s great But however, when you have just an ordinary account on Instagram YOU WILL GET HACKED I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;ll never use Instagram again, it&#39;s just too dangerous and there are too many hackers on this platform.After years of being on Instagram, it&#39;s time for me to permanently say goodbye to this horrible new unsafe version of Instagram"
Disappointed need my account back. Iv used Instagram for years and i actually unfortently have 3 accounts because everytime iv automatically been locked out of it for whatever it reason and not been able to access my accounts back Its disappointing that Instagram does not have a contact number to call or a email to message where I will get a straight answer and help to get my account back Today my account got hacked and the only way I could verify my account was through email and mobile number The email I couldnt because whoever hacked my account changed my email to theres The mobile number is my old number I dont have access to so cant verify through that either Its so frustrating I have so many photos of my kids on there that some stranger now has access to and I cant get it back because Instagram doesnt have any way of helping me gain it back I wont even bother making another account because the same thing will probably happen all over again
Instagram stories and music. My stories wont let me play any music . Im not sure if it cause my account is labeled as a business account which I have changed to personal and it wont let me look up any current music . The music it lets me play Ive never heard of . I know it said something about copy rights but wth. I just wanna add some music to my stories:(
"1 star for being Bc Im blocked from all action. 1 star at this moment; Im very disappointed &amp; annoyed with Instagram lately because I have my personal Account plus my husbands page and my dogs page. I have had Instagram for going on 8yrs now and until recently my dogs page had been blocked from liking, commenting, following and or etc. This will affect my personal &amp; husbands page as well. I have reported the problem a lot of time dailys &amp; reaches out to their customer service by message. But No one contacts back &amp; even responds an explanation. Theyve blocked me numerous times and Im not a fraudulent account. Im very aggravated and feel like deactivating all accounts and finding something new until they fix these problems. It seems Instagram is becoming way more controlling about the normal people who have accounts. Instead of controlling the scammers. I wish they would contact me to fix my problem. Until then this review will stay. Sincerely extremely aggravated user (users). Since Im not the only one who is going through this"
Spying app Vile. Why do we use an App which spies on us This is not acceptable but we accept it like mindless serfs
"Privacy?. People can see the account information and Im not sure how they know all my past usernames and the date I joined here, I want to make it so they cant access this information. Whenever they go to my profile theres always this option about this account but its never on there for anyone elses, how can I hide mine??"
"Music. So when I downloaded Instagram I had no problems with this before so its fairly recent.But the music icon it usually gives u a variety of music choices and the most popular out right now but now its just showing these random men,background music, and just songs Ive never heard of in my life. I went to my settings and it said I was a business account somehow but I dont remember changing it so I went back to personal but that did nothing to helpThe issue. And honestly this issue is very common, and I know this because when I was tryna solve it in my own and watch videos (that were no help) the people in the comments all had the same issue as me.Is there anyway you can fix this ? If so that would be great"
Garbage. Screw the algorythm and false COVID info floating around everywhere. Disgusting deceptive company. No privacy and forces to submit your phone number one way or another to use the app and fakes \strange activity\ to grab it if you don\'t provide it immediately. Can\'t wait until this phases out
"Learning curve. Working well I think,  saving up for a desktop ,  mobile apps give me anxiety cause of all the terms and conditions I dont understand and different definition of words I believe in  I recently learned anxiety is from not trusting oneself and the removal of privacy is the 1st step for brain washing technique  anyways looking forward to running by business from an actual dashboard on a computer so I can see and understand my network  Thanks  being patient with me. I know I can be frustrating at times.  I promise its not on purpose @ developers"
"Im confused help. All of a sudden Im not getting my notifications from instagram, I deleted and re-downloaded the app, fixed the setting on Instagram and on my phones setting, restart my phone and it still wont let me receive any notifications no matter what I do :/"
NO FREEDOM OF SPEECH. An app that sells the contents of your profile to third party unauthorised organisations. Sickening censorship of Palestine. Censored everything associated with the massacre of thousands of people in Palestine in order to hide Israels acts of violence and war crimes against humanity. The app exploits your privacy. Zero respect to your freedom of speech. Supports mass murders of unarmed adults and children. Aids and abets Israel and the USA in the commission of crime against humanity. Yes Mark you are a callous scheming complicit in the genocide against Palestine and humanity
"WHY CANT I LOG IN. I got hacked. Deleted Instagram. Tried to login and its not letting me. It wont let me log in on any of my tracking accounts. I have a business to run It keeps saying Sorry, there was a problem with your request Fix it now Instagram. Its been a week. I have contacted customer service and theyre terrible I hate Instagram Im gonna take my business else where"
Hacked and deleted account with no recovery help. I have contacted Instagram numerous times to try and help recover my migraine advocacy account @lifewithmigraine that was hacked and then subsequently deleted. I have heard nothing back and still cannot even see the account. This is a heartbreaking situation as my advocacy account promoted science-based information on migraine and helped others find the newest treatment options for this very debilitating disease. I had a following of over 3000 people that was growing every day. I am so disappointed that Instagram does not have more community support for these kinds of issues
Turn off auto play. Give an option to turn off auto play on iOS to save data Makes me use Instagram less
Instagram music not working. Weird to explain but the music that comes up is very random Russian or Spanish music. There is NOTHING popular listed / I cant even search anything. It said something about copyrights and I assumed it was because of my business account. So I switched back to personal. Still nothing. I deleted app and reinstalled. Nothing. I updated. Nothing. Logged out. Nothing. I hate this cause I love the music sticker when posting stories
"Merging. How cool would it be to be able to have more control over your instagram account such as  merging data, being able to merge pages to close another, moving all your follower to another instagram page you run, being able to move all your pictures and videos to another instagram you run, to easily download your content onto your phone with a security protocol. The thought of having to reload and repost every post is cringe worthy. The fact in 2020 with all the technology that we cant do that baffles me"
"Being back likes. Seriously? You are going to push your marketplace on us? That not why we use Instagram, we want to see our notifications, not what Brittnay is selling down the street out of her basement. Stop. No one likes the update. Change it back"
"Instagram notifications. I have 2 accounts on instagram, a business one and a personal one, none of my notifications are working, they are all on, everything checked, been 2 months,"
"stop making lame changes. Why did you guys take away the option to see who viewed our stories after 24 hours? You collect all our data and make big bucks, how about you let us have access to some of it. Smh. AND NOW YOU CHANGED IT TO YOU CANT EVEN SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE. Dude so unnecessary"
"Trash. I hate it, this is so trash I made an account and it asks for my idk and many other personal info. Seriously?"
No reels??. Please help.I love Instagram. Its probably the only socials I use .But I just have one problem. So I have two accounts. One personal and one where I share recipes and cooking. I love how easy it is to swap between each account but the accounts have two different layouts. How come I have reels one my personal account but not on the other account? Surely you should have the same properties on all the Instagram accounts so that we can get the full experience ?
"My thought of Instagram. Instagram is a amazing app but it is not good for kids that are 10 or younger why you may ask? Well it is because on instagram there is a lot of dirty minded old man who try and get your information and text you but sooner or later they will start asking for nudes and personal information, so if you think that your kid is educated with those types of things then let them have Instagram if the ask for it. Instagram is a really good app because you can make new friends and text and call people but if you dont want your kids chatting with strangers on social media you can disable it and if you want to know how to do that then look it up in google. It is also good because it is like your little journal but minus writing in a book meaning you can post photos of yourself, and post cool things on your story of you and what is happening in your life.... if you are going to let your child have Instagram then I suggest you watch what they are doing and check what they are up to on Instagram because there are a lot of creepy old man on social media from me and other peoples experience.... other then the creeps on Instagram it is a great app and I highly recommed getting it"
Please send feedback. Excuse me Instagram but whenever I tag someone in my story they cant add it to theres. Is it because I have my account on private or...?
This app is not good. I cant log in to my personal account for the past week INSTAGRAM PLEASE FIX THIS
No Good. This app is not good no more like it use to be Ill tell everyone not to download this or Facebook cause these steal all your information and sell it
"Instagram. My Instagram is not letting me change my profile, and I can see my Instagram messages, also I cant switch back to my personal account and i just think this is very unacceptable. Please fix it"
"Lots of Issues and No Support. Ive created a second account for a business and everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. From the beginning, certain features werent working and no matter what I couldnt get an updated version of Instagram. Yet my personal account was completely updated. Ive reported the issues over 2 months ago and havent received any support or help"
"Terrible job: removing imposter accounts, and providing live help for tech issues. Weve reported an account that keeps posting pictures and impersonating as my friends account, just to scam people for her fake Forex business. IG only cares to let us submit reports on accounts that are celebrity imposters, but not regular people. They havent done anything, and the imposter keeps using all of my friends pictures to run a fake scheme and scamming people. I also dont like that I cant get help on my business account. I cant see the Current Story Shares on the content I post. Its just a loading wheel and never displays the people sharing my content. Also, I dont like that Im forced to only be able to share my IG posts onto my FB business account. Id rather keep it on my personal page for now"
"Questions. Did this last update and now it wont let me share posts to my story. It gives me the option on my personal page, but from my business page/skate page it doesnt give me the option anymore . When earlier it did  Please fix this  ASAP"
Worse and worse than better and better. No music option and also I can&#39;t reshare stories where I&#39;m tagged even the privacy for sharing is turned on
"Hacked and deleted. Ive had an instagram account for about 5/6 years now and randomly one day my password was changed so i could no longer get back in. I tried emailing and contacting instagram about it so many times, even payed for a tech person to help me and they did nothing. And this account has picture of me on it and i used it for my business. So eventually i made a new instagram when i really didnt want to, i had it for maybe a week and instagram completely deleted the entire thing. For no reason. And everytime i try to get a recovery code sent to my number or email they dont send me anything. This app i stupid at this point, i cant even contact someone about my own person account and they delete my other ones"
HACKED ACCOUNT. My account was hacked and Instagram failed to help me recover it.. someone can easily change your email/phone number and when you click help or this wasnt me it send you to a link that isnt useful at all my name was Dezarai.fox and now the guy changed it to Berry @ 1234567gggh8i SOMEONE PLEASE HELP photos of my dead family members on there Ill never recover 
"Unhappy. Instagram is an awesome social media platform but I cant say the customer service/support. My account was hacked/disabled/deleted without warning. I know for fact I didnt violate any rules. I initiated help and reported it via help page and no replies. I lost the whole account, pictures, chats, followers, memories and have no clue why. It was likely an error and erroneously deleted. Feedback wouldnt be great though, just like the request for this review initiated by Instagram. Im guessing theres no verification or check and balances before deleting accounts. Im totally disappointed and frustrated over having to recreate"
"Algorithm stinks. The placement of the shop button is all wrong, it should be at the top out of the way. Everyone doesnt shop on Instagram, its just a nuisance when you want to make regular posts and keep tapping it. What should be at the bottom are the normal instagram tools- post, story, reel, discovery page- keep it simple. On the top can be the links to other personal pages, shop.   Also, you should allow us to put feed posts into highlights directly (like we can for stories). It will slow for better organization of the page especially if there are multiple things happening on one page, for instance - finance, real estate, decor, etcThe algorithm still stinks- Ive lost about 1500 followers since the beginning of the year, and Ive noticed this same thing happening on other creators pages as well. Instagram is not really promoting growth which is whats driving people to tiktok"
"App lockout. Ive enjoyed Instagram for many years up until now. However, I suppose that app has decided that today I am not allowed to use it. It kept telling me that there was a connection error despite the fact that I had wifi. I tried everything I could think of: I switched to data, I closed the app, restarted my phone, and finally I deleted the app. Now I have redownloaded the app and it will not allow me to log in"
"Logging me out of accounts. Hey Instagram, I really love this app, BUT INSTAGRAM LATELY HAS BEEN LOGGING ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNTS , which i dont know why &amp; when I try to log back in it tells me its an error when all the information is correct. Once again I really love this app, so I hope you can fix this"
Smh Instagram. Usually I live using Instagram and dont have a problem but as Im reading other peoples comments Im realizing that Im not the only one with this problem. I have a personal account and I have been blocked and had to reset my password multiple times because I am for some reason being accused of sharing my info for likes and follow. Now I could really care less how many likes and follows I have on my personal account and the fact that I literally have done no such thing to provoke this block yet its the second time Ive gotten it is very frustrating. Ive been using Instagram since 2014. Its frustrating to have to deal with these problems
"Instagram is fun but they should improve some things. Instagram has been a very fun platform to use. I have a few suggestions that could improve the app. First, reels needs to be fixed. Making reels is such a pain in the butt. Its just so awful to use and making them isnt very fun. It messes up a lot and is very frustrating. And then when I try to make reels in advance and save as a draft to post later, the reel completely disappears and cannot be posted. They should at least fix the problem with saving/posting drafts. Second, theyve added a new thing where pictures from people you arent following will show up on your tl. They should keep that stuff on the explore page and show content from people you do follow I know I dont see everyones content Third, PLEASE add a feature where you can change the order of carousel photos after posting I think this would be an INCREDIBLE feature to add. Sometimes when you post a carousel, the photo you chose to go in front doesnt work well with your feed. It would be great if this could be rearranged after posting. We can change reel cover photos (great feature btw), I dont see why this couldnt be added as well Another thing, you have the ability to change reel cover photos after posting which I LOVE but every time an update is released, the changed photo disappears and goes back to the original. Please fix this"
"bad app. censors people speaking up about palestine and invades privacy, the ads are just creepy at this point"
"Someone made a duplicate account. Im so angry, a person stole my Facebook pics made an account with my name and has followers and follows people This is a deep violation of my privacy and using my images without my permission I reported it to Instagram no removal for days now This is serious this person went from Facebook to IG and made an account while my real account doesnt use my name How the heck do I get rid of that other account?????"
"Too many hackers. To the creators of Instagram, I just want to say I do not appreciate the amount of hackers there are in this app this is supposedly a safe app and safe environment then why must I change my password multiple times just for people to stay off of my account? You should have a security alert informing the original owner when their account is being tampered with if it happens again I will sue because that is invasion of my 4th amendment rights and I have personal information on there"
"double notifications. i own a personal instagram and a business instagram, i keep the two separate for obvious reasoning. if i get a message while im on one the accounts, lets say im on my business account, ill get the notification twice. ill see the banner ontop and then get ANOTHER saying its for my business account"
"Instagram why are you letting hackers abuse your login page?. My privacy IP address has been violated and I have a feeling that a person who is currently harassing me on Instagram is sending me multiple email notifications trying to hack my account on purpose. I tried checking their email domain it looked weird it was a (c*******u@*****.tt) for this account user (s_m_xv). The domain I researched it and its called Trinidad and Tobago internet country code top level domain. This person whos harassing me always has a way to find my Instagram account even though I changed my username and password twice already. They start sending me multiple annoying notification emails of password reset requests abusing the Instagram login page constantly pressing the forgotten password button typing in my username. Please, make changes to your login page by making it more secure and stop letting these hackers abuse your login page. I already know whos behind this trying to sabotage my Instagram experience. Her name is Shanila Mounir (Munir) she has two sisters Anisa and Fayzah Amber Munir. They are Pakistani girls from Birmingham Halesowen UK. Shanila had her account removed for hate speech about me. Shes trying to take her revenge out on me by doing this login hacking scheme by using a illegal top domain in order to harass me her sister Anisa is in on it too. They all stalk me by making multiple fake accounts pretending to be different people trying to follow my private account. Please Have this domain and this user (c*******u@*****.tt) owner of this domain (@s_m_xv) aka Shanila Mounir (Munir) terminated and banned from your entire Instagram platform"
Not allowing others to repost my stories. From one day to another my friends where not allowed to share the stories Ive tagged them on I tried going on privacy setting but its still not giving me the option to allow others to share my stories
"DATA POLICY. These people have already sold your data to the highest bidder, just a reminder. :)"
"Instagram Famous. Instagram has been a well founded and established digital platform to explore the world through pictures, its incredible the amount of amazing places you can see thru pictures and tap into the dynamic of the scene. "
Instagram. I love my personal account pls dont disable my account
"Help Please. For the past two days, ever since the latest update, I have been having a LOT of issues with Instagram. I tap on the app and it is just black. It just loads and loads and it just keeps on loading for so long, the longest I have waited for the loading to stop is a straight ten minutes, by then I just gave up. I have tried turning my phone off and on again. I have tried using cellular data, changing WiFi, and it still will not work. I dont know what to do, I need help PLEASE"
MAJOR SECURITY ALERT PLEASE HELP. I got my account hacked by trying to help one of my followers (who I assume was also hacked). I believe the way this works is by requesting a forgot password link copying that link and sending it to someone else without clicking it. when you send the link back to the original person that requested the link (the hacker) they click the link and what seemed to be IMMEDIATELY they were signed into my account and I was logged out. in a matter of seconds both password authentication were bypassed and they changed all my login information. I cant request an email change or a password change nor use my phone number to get access back into my account. I reached out to instagram support but please understand the urgency when the person who gained access to my account is going through my direct messages and texting everyone i follow to do the same. It is a complete invasion of privacy and this method seems so dangerously easy to trick anyone and gain access to private chats
Suppresses Free Speech. Bunch of Free speech Nazis who work around the clock to block ideas that dont align with their personal views. They have hired thousands of Fact checkers who invade on other peoples opinions &amp; ideologies. Theyve hired USA Today to do their fact checking then block ANYTHING politically they dont agree with. This app is extremely INVASIVE and against WE THE PEOPLE right to free speech &amp; the RIGHT to politically disagree. I hate this app &amp; their NAZIFIED agenda
Someone is impersonating me and I cant get help. Someone stole my photos and made an account using my name. Now they are messaging my friends as if they are me. I cant get any help from Instagram and there is no way to talk to a human on the phone for assistance
"An app that violates privacy, copies other apps and is perfect for self absorbed people. An app for people to find affirmation for their fragile self esteems and reinforce foolish behavior"
Harassment and bullying. This past week I have been harassed buy a girl who has never been to my salon and is trying to slander my name Ive been reporting it all week and nothing has been done and nobody has reached out to me.I even switched my hair page to a personal account please help get the false info and bullying shes done taken down
Share info about changing features. &#34;On This Day&#34; was(?) an IG feature that let you see &amp; repost what you posted on that date in the past. It was moved or deleted in the most recent update but there does not appear to be any easily accessible information available confirming it&#39;s gone or explaining how to find it now. Weird choice given that it seemed like a popular feature in my feed
"Account hacked & no customer service to help. My account was hacked this month. Took myself two days to some how prove to Instagram/Facebook/Meta that it was stolen. Then, Instagram froze my user name and I havent been able to change it. Not user friendly and no customer service"
"Can we have a feature to manage our notifications from the people we follow?. Id like to see  a list of people whose notifications im subscribed to and also be able to have a separate notification page with just their posts. I dont want the notifications going to my phone, just  the app"
Hackers. Peaple keep Getting hacked more and more just today we are 7 that got hacked and trying to get everything back with 0 help from Instagram Costumer service 0  Be careful guys
"Following Random Accounts. I have been using instagram for many years, and I enjoy it. However, since this started happening to my account, I really starting to dislike it and wonder if it is any longer a safe platform to use. I googled why my account is following random accounts. It seems that Instagram has been having this problem for a while. I DO NOT want to follow these random accounts. Instagram keeps following these random accounts for me. I believe this will become a big issue on peoples privacy. Change it, fix it"
"Not bad, could be better. I know it all has to do with the pages you most interact with, but just because I interact with meme pages more doesnt mean I dont still want to see wayyyy more variety of peoples personal accounts, even though I dont like those as frequently. We need a solution to this.Also can we pleaseee get an update where in a post that has multiple pictures, we can change which photo from that series appears on our profile?"
We Hate the automatic reel playing. My husband and I hate the automatic video reels  I deleted my app and my husband seldom looks at Instagram because of the reelsand you cant go to settings for option to turn automatic video playing off  Unwanted reels eat up my data too  you are ruining Instagram many will leave
opinions. As wonderful it is to see and chat...With family and friends.... unfortunately I have seen and heard due to different political ideology .    Also has become a platform  on how to lose friends on personal political Opinions I personally try my best not to post any negative political views.  
Security code failure. My Instagram was hacked and now Im locked out. The security code never works to access my account. There is no online help or anyway to talk to a real person to help me get back into my account. Im losing access to 7+ years of content
"App is broken. All of a sudden after making a report, I cant see any posts on my feed? Like nothing is loading whether Im on wifi or data, private or public network. Doesnt matter, the app isnt loading any images for me"
"It works until it doesn't. I&#39;ve been using instagram quite often and spending hours every day. And I decided to improve the posts I made in my stories. So when I made a new post, I was going there sharing it into my story and adding some stickers around. One day a friend showed a way that he was actually adding a video from the gallery over the post so it plays a video and when you tap it, goes to the post. No matter what I&#39;ve tried, I don&#39;t have that feature. I&#39;ve changed to personal, business, creator accounts. Deleted app 20 times. Logged out and back again. No luck. Ah and also wrote report problem 4 times. I&#39;m pretty convinced that noone actually reads that part. So I&#39;m hoping after a year or two someone will notice or have the same bug and this post might become seen by chance so some developer fixes the issue for good. Meanwhile, my dear followers, I apologize for plain stories while others can do all their wildest dreams. Talk me about fair action"
Support. My IG was hacked and all the emails and reports Ive sent NOTHING was done. I sent emails after emails screen shots of my hacker changing my account info and STILL NO SUPPORT
"terrible new update. no one is using Instagram to shop. I understand that you hope it makes you more money but no one wants to shop on Instagram. if they did, the option is easily found in the search screen.no one was asking for the shop and the reel options to be that accessible. most people use Instagram as a PERSONAL social media. NOT TO SHOP OR WATCH VIDEOS.bring the old IG back please"
Spam Spam Spam. I do not need to be told who to follow. This is unsolicited spam. Please get rid of suggestions to follow and put back old posts on the main page. Stop changing things that arent broken. Suggestions should be opt in as most breach GDPR with the data they collect
"Feature missing. Is has been some time since my followers whom I mentioned in my stories were able to re-share the story through add this to my story option since this option was not active. This happened only when I mentioned someone in my private instagram account. I have looked for a reason and I found out that in my story settings, the feature allow re-sharing to my stories doesn&#39;t exist I am using the latest version of instagram, and I have this feature on my other account, only not on my personal account It is disappointing that the management, programmers and support team doesn&#39;t check the consistency of the app regularly"
Ruined by Advertising. Used to love this app but now its two posts then an advertisement. How this advertising is ok to is beyond me. Walk past a shop bam its an ad. Mention something bam its an ad. Abuse of data collection now instagram
"Its okay, but. its honestly like a ripoff of tiktok, reels audio and even videos. but if you are looking for an app to chat with friends in groups or just personal messages, and see cute photos/videos this is the app for you. its just like facebook with stories and DMs but overall its just a mix of tiktok and facebook. 3 stars"
PRIVACY WARNING. They are currently being sued for watching users through front cameras
"Why Id give you zero stars. I use this app just to stay in touch. I just want all the money back you sold to from the info you spied on me for, made Congress protect your monopoly so we cant sue you guys for stealing and selling my info. So... what now? You really not gonna pay me for helping you guys become power hungry robots.I also have male nipples, dont your robots know the difference from male nipples from female??? Im all in favor for no social platforms with a FEMALE nipple, its just horrible for children to see a nipple from a female, male nipples are the way of the world"
"Hiding number of likes on personal post & bring back chronological order. Good app overall but when will you guys allow the option for hiding the number of likes under an instagram post? Ive been waiting since last year. I just wanna share my pictures without having to show how many likes it has received. Also yall should bring back chronological order cause I keep seeing the useless posts from 2 days ago etc. I wanna see all the posts from who im following at real time, not the same repetitive posts"
Hacked. Scammers have hacked my account No one at instagram is doing anything to fix the problem I have made endless attempts to recover my account Ive received the codes handwritten on paper and sent back the photo. What is the hold up The scammers have already stolen money from my friends With all the money instagram and facebook earn from the people of the world the least they could do is have some kind of customer service Please act These criminals are using my identity to steal from good people and Instagram is doing nothing about it HELP ME
"Cant get help with anything. I was logged out of my account for a week, kept showing errors. Its really hard to get assistants from Instagram unless you choose account for hacked option. Instagram couldnt find any issues. Also I cant change my profile picture, Report my the issues a million times. But nothing happened"
Love Instagram. Instagram is the best platform Ive ever used. I have been apart of IG since 2011 on my personal account. It is so amazing to see the progress in which it has achieved Instagram is creating opportunities and its truly amazing what they are doing 
"Unable to share my own post to insta story. I created a new IG for business in Jan 2019, separate from my personal one. But it is missing all the basic functionalities for insta stories like share post from feed to stories (my own ones, settings checked too), add a photo or music to an IG story.. and so on. Raised the issue many times and never heard back from IG. From looking online many are getting the same issue with no answer"
Personal name being used. I tried using my legal name on Instagram for my username but I found an account that had no posts that was using it. Can you please fix this somehow?
Video selfie to LOGIN???. Ridiculous data mining dressed up as security just to login into your own account Farcebook Instagram really the most pathetic manipulative company
Lots of spam and fake accounts. So many fake accounts and spam. Flooding my inbox asking for money or linking to other sites. And then my followers get hacked and get fake messages from them. Its getting ridiculous
"Not at all what it used to be years ago. Used to be a great app, but since they started censoring everything its almost impossible to use. Nothing loading and they put covid related info on not covid related posts and its annoying  and every time you watch someones stories they complaining about how they could not upload any stories "
Glitches. Ive been unable to get access to Instagram I got hacked last year and made a new account and this one doesnt work so I am getting a little irritated because I have to keep starting over and over again because of these glitches
"My account of ten years @maseflip was stolen from me. My account of ten years @maseflip was hacked/stolen from me, and held for ransom.I have the emails to prove this.I have not be able to get ahold of anyone at Instagram to get my account back so Ive been forced to start all over with this one.As a result my business has taken a hit, but it is what it is I guess"
Seriously?. STOP WITH THE PRIVACY CHECK POINT POP UP
Why cant I readd a real to my grid. Lame that I cant add a real back to my grid on instagram. Also why cant you hide likes on a instagram real?? Can we get more data insight also why make my posts go viral kk tyvm. 
Fake updates to get your information. Update after update to steal information. Dont change the app at all
"New update. The new update makes it very difficult for me to see my mutuals posts. I often find myself missing a ton and the see older posts feature is not helpful at all. Instagram is also removing me as a follower from many creators, friends and mutuals. The new update with the shop button placement is annoying too and serves no new purpose. Ive also heard on the new Instagram update sharing posts to stories wont be an option. Considering this is a way to share information, support artists and small businesss and help people grow its upsetting. Apparently privacy will be more invasive as well. All of these factors and more have brought me to the conclusion of deleting my account and the app"
Vent Out. This is more better privacy to vent out angerThanks ... It is No 1 for my venting out and privacy
Add yours new feature. For some reason on my personal page it will not allow me tap add yours on other people story so I can put my picture but it works on my business page. Its super frustrating. Also I used to be able to share a countdown on my personal page but I cant do it now
"Getting hack too much. Ugh. I love instagram for my pictures and others things but lately since 2021, my personal account been hacked and I have to create and new account. With my new account starting all over, I get hacked again trying to get my account back. Instagram you need to do something with people hacking accounts"
Great platform. I love working on Instagram Easy to use for personal and commercial exposure
I cant even use it. It wont let me even give it permission to use camera and library or microphone so please make it send a request cuz I even went to the privacy settings and it wont let me Bc it wont send a request to use it 
"Would not delete my credit card info. Would not delete my credit card info, help support did not help at all. Dont use this app if you want control, privacy or security"
Frustrated. The button for allow sharing to stories doesnt show up on my Instagram privacy/story settings  even though I have the most updated version. So my friends cant share my stories to their story which is very frustrating
"Lets cancel instagram. Instagram disabled my personal account with no reason and I dont even use third party apps Thanks for Providing Your InfoWe&#39;ll review your info and if we can confirm it, you&#39;ll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours"
I got my account hacked and random sent and deleted to people I never followed. My account was very recently hacked and a message was sent to one of my old class mates. I dont know what it was. It was sent and deleted by someone else who hacked my account and I did not see what it was before it was deleted. I am very concerned for my safety because I obviously do not know what the message contained and the way she addressed my account which didnt have my name on it was very alarming. She alsopromptly  blocked my account and I cant get ahold of her to ask what it was and apologize. Thanks Instagram. I wouldnt download this app if you like privacy and not having your account hacked
"Non-partisan features. Not sure what the deal is with this- alpha/beta testing? Follower based? Some kind of reward system? Who knows.Anyway, Ive lost the ability to repost anything to my story. With no explanation of course, and no response from support. So minus one star for that. Minus another star for the extreme irritation this causes when everyone I follow is reposting to their stories. Tempted to knock off another star because I manage a brand account and cant share anything from that to my personal account"
"LOVE INSTAGRAM. id give it no stars if i could my account was hacked after many years of use and ive tried contacting instagram with proof of identity and proof it was hacked but its been weeks and havent heard a word back and keep getting friends telling me theyre getting scam texts from my instagram , figured this was my last effort to get my own account back will let my review show when or if they resolve this problemupdate still have my personal instagram hacked given all the proof and they still havent done a single thing to get it back to md"
Cant share posts to story. Instagram please sort the share to story thing out. Its so frustrating. Dont get me wrong I LOVE THIS APP but pleaseCAN WE GET THE SHARE TO STORY FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS my personal works fine but my business one doesnt.  Ive tried reporting it 10000 times Thankyou x
"Frustrated  LACK of support while hacking accounts increases. Someone hacked my Instagram account; unfortunately, they changed my email, added a phone number, changed the password as well as added 2 factor authentication. I have sent reports and reports through the app explaining the whole situation and nothing back. Id say over 20 reports total in the past 2 weeks. Ive emailed, tried calling, messaging through Facebook, dming on Instagram, tweeting Instagram multiples of time as well as messaging through that, Ive tried commenting on Instagram posts as well as the first resort that led me to the same place  the help center. It says that they can send a reversible link to my original email that was with the account that I still have access to, but I cannot get ahold of them to send me an appropriate link. I have been on Instagram for years, but honestly, I dont understand how this person found out my email, got into that, plus changed all the information so easily. Im frustrated that someone has had access to my account for this long and Ive had no support. This really should be improved. Seriously. I feel like Im never going to get it addressed. If I dont, Ill more than likely just stay off the app. Starting new just seems unnecessary and i have too many memories on my other original account. Even if i did start a new account, it would likely have the same problem eventually.  if support decides to check the reports its from @andyyyyxox. I can prove that this account @ampretro is ME. Thank you in return"
Unable to report a problem. For some strange reason I dont have the option to allow users to repost my story. I have tried Googling this to fix this issue for the glitch yet nothing has worked. Between trying on different devices to uninstalling and reinstalling the app. So I went to go report a problem via the app. And even that feature doesnt work I just get a report submission failed error please try again and low and behold it still doesnt work. And to get out of the app I have to force close it. So the other way to contact Instagram is through this feature which doesnt work so I cant even fix the problem. Ive had to get friend to report it on my behalf. But knowing Instagram due to their privacy settings this is going to be a pointless task
Thieves. Steal all your info and sell it but so does this phone so theres no point to any of this yall afraid of a vaccine but carry phones around smh George bush should be in jail for war crimes
"Content Creative. This App allows you to not only post with captions and tag people, but it also has Reels Reels is a new update and there is a FYP which shows you all of the most trending videos I love this app because you have the ability to make your account as private and personal as possible but also the same with Public 9/10 recommend because sometimes you will find some inappropriate things but its okay because you should just ignore it. Anyways I love this app a ton"
"instagram isnt working. the profile picture are grey, the stories i watch are grey, and people posts are grey. i also cant follow anyone"
No answers. I have never been able to get notifications on my phone spoke to apple they said contact insta as there is a bug between my ohone and the app they never respond Works on my work phone but not my personal one No one seems to care enough to want to help
Please help. For a few weeks now Ive had my Instagram account switched back to personal after previously having it on a business profile. Ive been absolutely unable to remove the Just For Fun out of my bio?? Its super annoying because every time I try it crashes. Ive tried switching back and forth and it still remains
"Obviously a breach of privacy. Right to the point- it is an absolute PAIN for me to log out of any accounts, and just tonight, a friend of mines profile logged into my phone. As in, I can access every single part of her part of her profile??? Thats seriously messed up  Trying to log her out does nothing, Ive tried deleting the app and trying again, and it seriously does nothing. Imagine if her profile came in the hands of some nasty or malicious character. Absolutely disgusting"
Egads Great suffering Jesus. The amount of data (MINE) you collect is obscene. STOP IT
"Instagram supports hackers and scammers. First off Ive had my account since 2012.And recently theres been these bitcoin scammers going around asking people to verify the account by sending them a screenshot that is texted to their phone. I had this happen to me and a hacker gained access to my account. Immediately they changed all my login information and since I do not have the original email that I used to sign up with there was no way for me to recover the account. Ive contacted Instagram about this issue multiple times. Had to do a video verification as well as create a hand written sign with a code Instagram sent me, with photo of my self holding this sign. Ive done both of these verification methods multiple times in Instagram continuously tells me they cannot verify the account belongs to me. Although my face is on my Instagram account in multiple pictures and whoever hacked my account signed in from another country and started posting about a random bitcoin scam that I dont usually post about. Thats not suspicious to you Instagram? You cant get in touch with anybody from corporate, no one returns emails. They just respond back with we cannot verify your account.Instagram you are a joke and so are the people that work for you So many people even reported my account as hacked or posting spam and Instagram says theres nothing suspicious about the account"
Please add ability to show/hide Like counts. Instagram added it to one of my accounts under Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Posts &gt; Show/Hide Like Counts  but it&#39;s not showing up for my other account. Please add it to all accounts
"Love the concept but cant stand the ads. I have used it for a many years. Lately cant stand the ads in the app. And I think they are getting too personal. I know its the way they make money, but its too much. Stopped using it, and Im feeling great. Just came here to drop this review as I have installed it again, and after 10 seconds I thought about deleting it again. Im outI have paid for WhatsApp when they started a few years ago, 1 per year. Can we have the same for instagram, but to avoid this kind of ads? Like premium account with no ads and with no suggested accounts or posts? I would buy that"
Genesis is mad. I love Instagram but when I was talking to my friend my mom told me who you talking to I said my friend that go to school with me and she told my dad and he have tracked my phone and so when I try to download a game he stop me like Im 8 years old like for real my dad and mom over protective over me like omgggg
"Hiding likes. My instagram does not show the option to turn of my like count via settings then privacy where the option is for everyone else, and my instagram is fully updated, its been like this for weeks"
Cant post nothing. Ive tried to Post multiple photos. They just disappear without warning. No violations. Verified e-mail and phone number. Not connected to Facebook. Maybe thats why? I refuse to share the two. Thats why my birthday is 1914 in the app and no gender. Just let me upload my pictures
Please sort out the bots. I love Instagram to connect with my friends from all over the world but the amount of cam bots in the past few days has been unreal as its all I see in my story viewers and you dont even accept the fact that theyre fake accounts or spam when its reported and Ive reported like 25 in the past two days. The only way to stop this it seems is to make my account private and Id rather not do that as I use it for business as well so please sort this out
Horrible update. The new update has far too many bugs. I havent been able to upload multiple pictures for days even after deleting and reinstalling. My account will not allow me to have my business account share to my personal Facebook although Ive been doing it for a year. Im extremely frustrated with this entire update
"Nice app. OK, so Instagram is a really good app but, I have to re-download it because I didnt get any notifications and I missing important events that my friends are hosting because I dont get any notifications. I tried to change the setting but it wouldnt let me nor let me change it in Instagram app. So Im bout to re-download it and see if it works OK Im back, It worked thank you guys so much for doing this app its really good Bye"
"Newest update is horrible. Just updated, and the app is extremely glitchy, terms and data policy screen pops up every time I open the app and needs to be acknowledged, older messages dont load, message notifications do not go away, and I only see ads and suggested posts- ZERO from the people I actually follow"
Cant share business accounts stories to my personal. Im trying to grow my business account and for some reason IG wont allow me to share the business acct stories to my personal acct. I have the stories shared content settings to allow and both are public
"Very very very slow. For some reason even after using private WiFi or mobile data, my Instagram always lags. I thought may be because I used android before but after switching to IOS, the problem continued. Messages would take a long time to get send, posts takes hours to load"
"Hacked. I have had the same Instagram account for 12 years. I was hacked this morning. Ive been trying all day to get back in. There are topics on the support help page, but none of them have worked for me. There is no option to email someone or to chat live with someone. How is my account supposed to be secure, when you cant even help me stop the scam that just happened?"
"Unwanted posts in feed. There are suggested posts in the personal feed tab. If users wanted to explore posts of people they dont follow they would just go to the explore tab, right beside it, a millimetre away"
"Sponsored ads are ruining this app. I miss the days when I could scroll past four photos before getting a targeted ad about crack pipes for sale on wish. I scrolled for about twenty minutes, I am not exaggerating when I say I could NOT get past four photos without getting an ad post its ridiculous and as much as I love this app its honestly not worth it, especially with some of the disgusting ads I get. Oh &amp; btw apparently you can just pay to have your own personal page sponsored because Ive seen about 30 people just advertising themselves to get more followers"
"Shutup about covid. Im tired of seeing covid disclaimersAlso dont use this app without tracker blockers, youll save yourself from giving some of your data to them and save some battery lifeMark Cuckerburg"
Love  Instagram. I love Instagram because I learn a lot of things its good to see whats going on I Instagram keep you updated with a lot of personal things Just my thoughts
"Too many toxic people. The app is great in my opinion it doesnt have any flaws the only thing is the community is toxic in addition to that it has no privacy like why do you need to watch me while the ads pass , its really weird having the thought that you guys are watching me . I delete the app due to the amount of toxic people and the no privacy methods you guys were taking"
Theyve ruined my personal feed. Personal feed is now 90% adds and accounts I dont follow. Whats the point even? Also the explore page has been ruined by large blocky posts that Im completely uninterested in
"Cyber bullying, Horrible customer service. Ive been with Instagram for about 10 years and recently I was hacked on Instagram. This person is messaging sexual things to my friends and stranger as well as passing around my personal photos which I never posted. I tried filling out a form for impersonation but it was not letting me submit the report, saying there was some sort of error with the site. Then I had multiple friends block and report my account but nothing seemed to have happened because my account was still hacked and actively used by the hacker (since the following kept increasing). I tried calling Instagram help line and emailing them as well but there was no solution and they kept putting me in circles to go back on the Instagram help center and figure it out from there. There is no one I can get human contact with for this sort of cyber bullying that is happening to me and so many others Im assuming. Absolutely terrified of hackers but Im more disappointed in Instagram since its such a huge platform and I cant get in touch with them while my image and dignity is being tarnished (been going on for almost a week now.)DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP AT ALL. Please be safe"
"Action Blocked. This new update...idk whats happened but Ive been action blocked on my main account and my business account, since my husband is linked to my business account hes been action blocked as well. Its been 4 days and we cant reply to customers or use our own personal Instagrams. Ive reached out to support numerous times but nothing has changed. Ridiculous, we are clearly not spam accounts"
2 issues. 1) See data linked to you section for app trackers2) ridiculous amounts of ads
Its not a store. Instagram used to be a place to share your life and story through pictures and videos and interact with people from around the world. It seems to now have turned into an online flea market centered on advertisements and selling products. This isnt what I signed up for
"Creepy. This app is so creepy Im sure it tracks absolutely everything on your phone. I was texting with my brother this afternoon and then a few hours later when I opened the app, it advertised to me what I was texting him about. That is the biggest breach of privacy. Surely that cant be legal????"
Why am I not seeing my likes. I like to know whys I am not seeing all my likes?I like to be able to see everything but I am not so I was thinking do I want to sell on Instagram may be not since I cant see my likes and whys I ammonitored Today 2/19/2022Also why people from Arizona keep logging to my account I dont know who is iPhone its not me I have changed my pass many times but the privacy is no ok in Instagram
"large page info. id rather not have my previous usernames shown to others because i feel like it invades my privacy considering i have a large following please make my previous usernames private again because i feel like it lowkey exposes me considering i have a meme page , please change this "
This app spies on me constantly. I hate that I cant avoid using it
I love it everything the privacy and the tolds has been using for like 8 years. I loved it
"Dont like the new update for connected accounts. I used to be able to connect my personal fb and Instagram, AND also my business fb and Instagram accounts independently. Since the update, its one or the other now"
"Annoyed. Personally Im a bit annoyed, I use Instagram for personal life posts and business, I have 16.4K and get offended brand work. I recently had to turn my account to private as I was getting harassed. Im now not able to access a creator account anymore and missing out on paid work as I cant assess things I should be able to. Very frustrating and annoying"
". I been in IG since 2012. I still love and share what I post because for me its too personal, I feel like its my daily diary"
My Instagram account changes to commercial without my consent. My Instagram account is changed to commercial without my consent and now it does not allow me to change it to a personal account. I need to be solved as soon as possible since my information is private and under no circumstances do I want it public
Blocking and account loss. Ive had Instagram for several years now and I was really enjoying using it. It took me several moths to get to where I had on that account until one day I went onto Instagram to find I was logged out. So I tried to log back in but nothing worked. I reset everything deleted the app but still nothing worked. Im really annoyed by this and I think it needs to be fixed as I know A lot of people have this problem and we all would like access to our accounts again
"Fix This. i went on a HUGE unfollowing spree to unfollow people who i dont really need to be following.. but i unfollowed them inside the instagram app. a few times it says i had to stop which was fine but one time after i did it it told me i was using a third-party app to get likes or follows, yet ive never used one of those ever  now i cant like none of my homies pictures or comment simply because instagram thought i was hacking and buying followers when all i did was unfollow alot of people.. ill be deleting it for good if this happens again"
"Does nothing against protecting minors privacy. You get scam messages asking minors for explicit pictures, and then when you report them, they do nothing to take account off the system, they just tell you to block them"
"app. its a great app but I cant ever use my cellular data to look at it, only wifi. this app has a lot of bugs that need to be resolved"
Why. Shiitttyyy editing and total crap posting Id want a refund of my data if I paid for data damnit
Worst app in history. I have had stranger ask me for personal information. Creepy. I do not recommend this app to any kids because child predators are on here. Also its not letting me follow anyone back because its saying action blocked Instagram if you dont fix your problems Im suing this is ridiculous. Worst app Ive ever downloaded in my life. Do not recommend whats so ever
"Please fix. Yall. The moment you fix one thing- something else stops working. My personal account is seeing comments when watching on live feeds- but my business account is not. I have swiped, pressed the three dots. Every single day for the last 6 weeks something os different, changed, not working. Please - sharing is crucial appreciate you getting rid of create and letting us share directly but as someone who pays for ads etc, you are becoming unreliable"
"Login issue. I dont know why but I cant log into my Instagram accounts on my phone. It keeps telling me there are error issues and that I cant and Im tired of it. I havent done anything wrong and I need to log into my stuff, all because I went to change my password now Im locked out? It doesnt make sense and I need it fixed.I CANT LOGIN AND I NEED TO ACCESS MY STUFF"
The App Has a Bugg. Of recently Instagram keeps logging me out of my account saying my account is compromised and that I shared my password with a third party app and I need to change it... Mind you I don&#39;t even know my password because I have the remember log in enabled from the last time this happened.... I barely post on my actual page maybe 1-2 post a month... I use my stories mostly... I have a business page separate to my personal page which leads to my point of I HAVE NO REASON TO USE A THIRD PARTY APP ON MY PERSONAL PAGE WHEN I&#39;M PAYING INSTAGRAM FOR ADVERTISEMENTS ON MY BUSINESS PAGE And now I&#39;m block on Instagram from liking commenting following or unfollowing anyone... basically in Instagram jail for a social media crime I did not commit and for the second time This is absolutely ridiculous and something is wrong and no one has responded to my support msg I sent through the help center This is a serious bug that needs to be fixed cuz it may cost me my page and I havent used any third party apps
Account log in. I just got a new phone and switched all of my info over but I wasnt kept logged into my Instagram and now ever password I put in is wrong I never get the text confirmation code so I can change my password which has happend before and I had to make a whole new account i cant log in with Facebook either
"Awesome. Instagram is a internet app, that where you post funny Menes and write in the comments, and post your picture in the Home Screen in Instagram app. This app is so fun to looking other people post and write in the comments below the picture in the small area where you see comments, I like this app. This new update is awesome and cool. Read other people post about their personal life, and top right is chat open it where you chat your friends of family members. People who made this app. to show the whole world to meet each other the ones. The person who really using the Instagram app. You dont be a really rude about this app. So I like this app. Instagram is a personality app. Who shared their posts to each other please dont unloved it, just be happy with it, most of other people who write a review, who is sad, and it heartbroken, so loved this app please thanks for reading it"
Account deactivated with no warning. Used instagram since I was 13 and lost all my data without any warning or and notice of what I was doing wrong. My up was flagged as a proxy without any warning or telling me anything. Lost all data from 2 years ago and have no way to recover it and I have tried all ways to get instragm to let me get my account back any it is not working. Anything I can to get my account back
"Getting annoying with all the spam. I used to like instagram but lately its been getting annoying with all the spam messages and spam comments... how come I still get spam messages even with a private account?? Messages shouldnt be allowed to be sent to random people who dont want others messages. It makes it really easy to get stalked, leaving you no option than deleting your account and getting a new one. They are also horrible at taking care of reports for bullying and harassment but they delete a comment for calling a person a child?? It doesnt make sense... I quit using Facebook because of the same toxic environment it had and now instagram is becoming the same thing... I mean its the same owner I guess"
Music. I have a personal Instagram and a business account. Both same app. Different profile. In my business account I cant upload music? Ive tried everything
Instagram. Hey can use update insta my account has been hacked n my old number is linked to it n I have no access to log back into my account again unless I send a code to my new number but theres nothing saying not using this number phone again n I really need that insta back ASAP plz
"Cant open profile page. For some reason I cant view my personal profile, I cant view and the screen will completely black out. I am not one to use this app much, but a creative I would like to view how my profile is going every now and then"
"My account was suspended/removed with no explanation. Honestly - at this point it seems that Instagram is removing accounts with my explanation why. I used to love Instagram for so many reasons. But when my private, small account was taken down with zero explanation or any means of getting it back I was pretty shocked and upset. I post pics of my cats, family, holidays, food and special events. And now I have no way of getting a lot of those pictures back. Super lame. Instagram - if u read this and could contact me that would be cool. As of now its been 30 days and still not one email from Instagram. I get this message that says we will review bla bla and you can appeal In 24 hours hours that was 30 days ago and still same message"
Dont give my person information out. I dont like that u will soon give person information out of that does happen I will uninstall this app and delete my account I dont agree
"Needs TL Lists. The bookmarks are cool, but IG needs a way to organize the TL similar to Twitter. I follow the following:* personal acquaintances * pop culture accounts * various hobbies and interest accounts (design/ food/fitness/machinery/ etc) * professional industry accounts * events accounts in my area that update daily with things happening that I would like to attend I would love the option to organize all of those accounts separately so if I wanted to view the events accounts I dont have to rack my brain trying to remember what accounts I followed in that provide events updates for xyz city. Thanks"
"Safety fraud. Dont get me wrong - the app itself is greatI use it often, but if I use it too much certain features get temporarily disabled and the app claims its to protect the communityThis is just a scam to limit personal use and is discriminatory toward loyal &amp; active users"
Help now . Instagram isnt letting me change my personal account into a professional account I need this fixed now
Not connecting with wifi or cellular service. As of today Instagram doesnt let me sign in and it keeps saying no internet connection and my wifi is working and my cellular data is working on other apps except this one right now. Hopefully you can look into this. I even restarted my iphone and its still not working
Privacy. Is end-end encryption a guarantee? What happens when I delete pictures? I have seen a number of glitches
Fb Israel agency. Spy
"Locked out of account. I was locked out of my account with no explanation. Was forced to enter phone # and email and verify both. Then was told my info is being reviewed and It will take 24 hours. That was week ago. They tell u to go to help center but u cant without being able to log in. I post pictures of my kids and dogs, no reason for lock out"
New Update is Awful. I have been using Instagram for years and I have loved it for a long time but recently the update has only been showing like 10-15 pictures of people that I actually follow before I get the youve been caught up notification at which point my feed turns into my discover page. This I just now got used to and accepted when today I go to use Instagram and see that there is a new update that has gotten rid of the activity page and replaced it with a shopping page??? I do not use Instagram to shop. Why do I need a whole tab dedicated to shopping when I dont even like seeing those ads on my actual feed. I hate the activity page being on the Home Screen. It makes no sense and only makes the app more complicated and less useful to me. Please get rid of the shop tab
"No Internet Connection. For the past month, anytime I go to Instagram, No Internet Connection and Couldnt Refresh Feed keep popping up and nothing loads. I check and I do have my data/wifi on. I have restarted my phone, deleted the app and reinstalled it, logged in through another device, changed my password and reported it and nothing has changed. I have multiple accounts and each of them have this problem. I have no idea if this is a problem with my account (but all of mine have the problem ?) or if this is a bug but I just want my accounts back to normal "
"weird microphone listen. Already delete this app because there are many fraudulent lottery ads and every time I enter a profile or message, They use the microphone to listen to my surroundings. Thanks to apple for the notifications of when they activate the microphones and on occasions to the camera. Facebook is being super weird colectin collecting data"
"Hacked. My Instagram account got hacked into late tonight on Friday November 12, 2021. This person has changed my password, removed my original email, changed my phone number to some number in Jamaica. And I live in Canada. I have absolutely no way of retrieve my account of over 550 followers. Its my personal account I do everything on it. I have another account but its not the same. If I could send pictures of the emails Ive gotten I would so yall could see what I mean. Ive tried clicking the link that gets sent to you original email says If you didnt authorize this  change click this link. I got four of those emails all at once. New login in Jamaica, password was changed, phone number was changed, and email was removed. And since the main important informations were change I cant just hit forgot password or resend the code, because those get sent to you email or phone number and this person changed EVERYTHING. So for the past two hours Ive been in tears trying to get back into my account. My main account got hacked into and I have another account linked to it and they are both gone I cant access either one of them. Im stuck with the one I made as a kid. And Instagram isnt helping me out. Im not sure if you one who has Instagram ever reads these reviews or not but if you do. But can you please help me retrieve my account"
"Some problems. I really like going on to instagram and seeing peoples post and what they are up to. I also like posting and people get to know more about me and what I like. I have notice a few things. I have gotten a message from my friend first say heyyy and then saying  Look what I did with some of your pictures, Don&#39;t get too mad. lol I clicked on it and it took me to this website but I just got off and told her that it sent that and she told me that it wasnt her and I was like thats really weird. I have two accounts and my main account messages my old account and say hey and said the same thing. I didnt do it so I think there is someone hacking into peoples accounts trying to get them to get a iPhone I believe. There was this thing also going around a while ago about something else. I just wanted to let u guys know and hope u guys can get this under control I really like Instagram and I hope it can get fixed"
"My Profile Wont Refresh Feed. Hi, my profile @bossvisions, will not refresh. My newsfeed will not refresh and my profile wont upload. I love this app, and would like to get things back on track.Thanks,"
"Story sharing issues. Instagram is a great social media platform due to its easy accessibility and straightforward method, and the ultimate goal is to share content with your friends and family. However, I cannot preform this simple function because I cannot share other posts to my story. Ive checked my privacy settings, and everything is in order there, and the account Im trying to republish is public, and I have seen other people sharing stories from this same account. Yet, when I click the share arrow, I do NOT get an option to Add this to your story, but rather it just lists my DM options. My app is updated, and I was just wondering how am I meant to fix this?"
Amazing app. I have 2 accounts one for personal and one for business as I do photography @photoking06 and I use it all the time
Needs an update. Instagram is an amazing app but it needs some bug fixes cause my Instagram is not refreshing on WiFi nor my cellular data &amp; Ive deleted the app twice &amp; still having this problem. Can you guys please update that bug
Censorship of Palestinian content. Choosing what I can and cannot post on my personal page and going against my freedom of speech
"Bug fix please. Lately on instagram there has been this bug for me and a lot of people where everytime you load up Instagram you dms disappear and you constantly have to keep reading them to a conversation and also on top of that your device doesnt always receive the messages... I have tested it out and it wasnt just my phone, I used my iPad and got the same Experience... I found even if I got a notification that read the message and I went into the conversation it would not always appear even after restarting the app multiple times"
"Terrible system for hacking recovery. This app does not have a system for hacking recovery. I have sent video selfies to Instagram to recover my hacked account 3+ times and each of them have failed Instagram should have a team of people that are trained to recover hacked accounts or at least security questions and Face ID, SOMETHING to stop these hackers I worked hard on my account since 2017 and all those pictures and stories and highlights are gone"
"Agendas. I see when I go to your search that BLM adds pop up and are asking for donations to these organizations. I taught my kids to respect everyone and listen to elders as well as respect authority. I taught them for every action there is a consequence,  if it is a dumb action then get your consequence. I taught them right from wrong maybe you should think about putting that info on your site. Dont push racial groups maybe push some respect"
Trouble. Why is my Instagram music not working I dont have a business account anymore and I switched back to personal ?
Not working. My Instagram page isnt loading. I have wifi and have full bars of data and it ant loading. When I deleted the app and the redownloaded the app and tried to log in it keeps saying error
"Cant use reels for one of my accounts - going to tik tok. For so long, Instagram has tried to stay current with the latest app. Ive got a creator account of around 15k on Instagram, and have always been loyal to it But now, as I see other accounts in the exact same region as me (east coast of USA) have access to the reel feature and I dont - it puts me at a huge disadvantage in the content creation field Ive got reels on my personal account (and even another creator account) but not this one and its so frustrating. Ive submitted dozen of report tickets to Instagram - nothing solved Doesnt seem like it ever will so looks like Im moving my audience to tik tok"
Junk. Selling your information to Russia
"Bug. when i try to use instagram, it says that theres no internet connection but i have perfectly fine connection. this also happens when i use my data. please fix this"
"Updated and lost the ability to add music. I updated my Instagram and noticed I am no longer able to use the music sticker or grab music from other stories to share on my own. I had a business account, but switched back to personal and it still isnt working. I know this is a ongoing problem with Instagram based on other posts and they dont have any information in their help centre to fix this when it happens. I didnt have any warnings, just one day it was removed"
"Features are inconsistent and unreliable. It wont allow for me to share other peoples posts on my story from my personal account but it will from others. And something as simple as deleting the app and redownloading it causes for me to sometimes be able to share posts from my meme account, and sometimes it will get rid of the feature all together, despite other people I know having no issues doing so. I dont understand what could possibly cause this to be such a difficult issue to fix. Just give everyone the exact same features"
"make a change. dear instagram,please make changes to the app. I wish to put my account on private,but it&#39;s on business and not personal. I don&#39;t like the fact i can&#39;t put my account on private. I will like to put my account private even if it&#39;s business account. I had multiple accounts impersonating others and messaging me my account is business not personal. I know you can put a personal account on private,but i want to be able to make business account on instagram also Private. So please, make a change"
"uploading. i LOVE instagram and have a private spam account that i use as my virtual diary. My only issue is that one video i have of me screen recording a snap chat filter ,,, wont upload ??? normal videos and other screen recordings upload fine but this video wont ? ive uninstalled and reinstalled instagram multiple times and it does the same thing ? this has been happening for DAYS and im very upset"
"Pls fix this. So I run a fan page on insta, and everythings been going fine up until the last two weeks where my actions were blocked. Like I cant click on my own profile page without getting the blocked notifications, even when Im just refreshing the page. Also my screen freezes when I press Tell Us to report a problemI hadnt been very active on my acc so it cant have been because I was spamming people. it might have been because someones reported my acc for spam, but instead of checking whether it was spam, insta just blocked every action I make, including visiting my own profile and switching between my personal accs"
"Sharing stories unavailable on my account. I have two accounts, one of which I have the option available to reshare other ppls content to my stories, but on my personal account that option doesnt even show up when I click on the icon. Ive troubleshooted, deleted the app and re-installed it twice, still no dice.Its pretty ridiculous, considering by now everyone has the option available to them.And of course I havent heard back from Instagram about the issue."
"This new update is HORRIBLE, i HATE it . The post button was moved to where you post stories and the notification bar was moved to the top by the direct messages and the shopping selection where the notifications used to be is horrible .. who shops on Instagram and if I do I go to the profile\'s personal website . I hate it me and my friends are already talking about going to Twitter because this is unacceptable. They need to change it back"
Forced location service to add a location. This is horrible. Instagram is forcing people to enable location services (no privacy) in order to add a location to a post. You used to be able to just add a location manually
Not everyone has a phone number or data. It wouldnt let me log into my account without a phone number. I dont have any data nor a phone number so I couldnt do nothing. Also there was no place for me to send feedback or ask for help
Account privacy non existent. Made my account public and now all prior usernames are being shown to my followers Just made my account fullg private and its still SHOWING this is a MASSIVE PRIVACY BREACH
"Please pay personal attention [@verbaa]. Hey guys, why do you keep blocking Ukrainian blogger @verbaa ? Im just a random follower nobody asked me to text you here. But just a message from myself - your Instagram community guidelines are contradicting your community - she is a huge influencer in my country, the only one of a kind. She is supporting lots of a small business and bringing people together. Your system keeps blocking her and deleting random stories and posts that bring absolutely no harm. And her account gets entirely deleted sometimes (not once, a few times).Can you please pay personal attention and fix it for us. 3 million people from Ukraine (her followers) will be grateful.If you do really find her content offensive for some reason why dont you provide an educational course to fix it? She brings lots of traffic to your app"
"Unwanted invasion of Privacy. I am not liking these suggested posts they keep adding to my page. If I wanted them I would have added them myself. Stop doing this - I feel like I want to shut it down what an invasion of privacy, get off my page"
new update is terrible. the new update where youve made it impossible to post new pictures or see likes is terrible. the main point of instagram is to be a photo sharing app. im not on there to shop. youve replaced likes aka the thing ppl are actually on instagram for for shopping channels??? its so a** backwards. it makes the app look ugly and makes me want to delete it
"Instagram is fun but they should improve some things. Instagram has been a very fun platform to use. I have a few suggestions that could improve the app. First, reels needs to be fixed. Making reels is such a pain in the butt. Its just so awful to use and making them isnt very fun. It messes up a lot and is very frustrating. And then when I try to make reels in advance and save as a draft to post later, the reel completely disappears and cannot be posted. They should at least fix the problem with saving/posting drafts. Second, theyve added a new thing where pictures from people you arent following will show up on your tl. They should keep that stuff on the explore page and show content from people you do follow I know I dont see everyones content Third, PLEASE add a feature where you can change the order of carousel photos after posting I think this would be an INCREDIBLE feature to add. Sometimes when you post a carousel, the photo you chose to go in front doesnt work well with your feed. It would be great if this could be rearranged after posting. We can change reel cover photos (great feature btw), I dont see why this couldnt be added as well"
"Get a Live tech support service. I have been using instagram for 10 years, 5 years on this same phone. I logged out of my account and now I cannot log back into it depiste having all login information because the verification codes it sends to my email do not work and produce error messages. This could likely be fixed im under a minute if Instagram bothered to have any customer service. This is extremely frustrating since this is a known problem"
cant click anything on my instagram. i cant click anything it says im already logged in and it keeps loading my wifi is off and my data is on it normally works but i dont know if the app is crashed
Its great but. Papa Zuckie is selling my data and thats not okie dokie
Feed. Add an option to turn off suggested posts. I dont want to see random accounts in my personal feed. Youre adding all of these things we dont need... we just want chronological order. 
"Account blocking. Been on Ig for years for my personal account, just created a business profile to gain more clientele, tried posting my work.. 2 posts.. and Im blocked because Ive uploaded 6 posts.. um its a business Reached out and reported the issue 5 times with IG and no response.. why offer a business profile option if you arent willing to help or fix the issue?? If I could give 0 stars I would"
Cant get answers. IG wont allow me to share posts to my story all of a sudden. Setting (privacy/story) doesnt even have a reshare option to enable or disable. Ive contacted IG not response and I cant find answers
No way to recover account. Its impossible to know if it was disabled by Instagram or hacked but their lack of support makes this app not worth downloading
Privacy. Why people Mac in and asking for passwords?so loyal
Crapstagram. The amount of bots the app has allowed to spam people is ridiculous. And the notifications that someone who hasnt posted in a long time posted is stupid. I dont care. Stop the random notifications and fix the real bugs in your system
"Confused. My personal Instagram account updated and works fine, HOWEVER...... My linked business account keeps automatically closing the app when I click on the heart to view my likes and comments"
My account was hacked. I love that my account was hacked and I have done everything requested of me to get my account back. Instead IG has told me my verification is NOT verifiable and is allowing Tata_gosal to successfully scan my followers. She kept my photos and my IG handle and is claiming to be me while telling my followers to dm her to make money then stealing as if it was me Great job IG security Yall are doing the best you can Im sure
"Good minus DMs. Ive used Instagram for around 6 years, but since around June of 2020, I stopped receiving any notifications from Instagram. I checked my settings (they were all fine), check my phone settings (also fine). Did updates, did research and nothing worked. Its April 2021 and I havent received any notifications since June. Im not complaining per say, I still use the app and direct message daily, but getting this fixed would be great"
"This is getting old. What is with the endless loop of Help us confirm you own this account? I just confirmed everything with IG after being hacked and now Im hitting yet another roadblock?This is a well known issue with Instagram and I would like it resolved so I can access my account. I have received an email saying: Hi, This problem should be fixed. We&#39;re sorry for any inconvenience this caused. four times now and the issues is still not fixed. I would like this matter escalated to someone who is able to correct the problem. Maybe this is just a sign that Instagram is behind the times and we should all move on to something else"
Won't let me access other accounts. Just switched to a new phone and upon logging in (with great difficulty) I wasn&#39;t able to find the other accounts I have connected to mine. There is now help option and it&#39;s very frustrating. Would like access to my other pictures and my only means for contacting someone is through this review. Used to be my favourite app but now it&#39;s just a pain
"Hacked account with no action done. My account got hacked roughly 3 weeks ago and Instagram has done nothing about it. Myself along with multiple friends and family have been reporting my old account (Nathanjmurdock) because the hacker is continuing to use my account and messaging family and friends asking for money. On top of that, they are reposting pictures of my family to the story acting like its me. I would love if Instagram would take the account down or even look into the matter to begin with but that has yet to happen. This hacker is literally posting scam post and fake story posts for weeks now and instragram has ignored it. Ive created a new account (njmurdock) to let family and friends know my old account has been hacked. Please help with this situation. I feel like my family and I are in danger by having a stranger have access to personal information"
"Good for small business. I thought posting work-stagram wouldnt work for my small business, but it really helps a lot.I am extremely enjoying instagram rather than a posting my personal feeds"
"dgaf about users. great place to sell drugs, spread false information or clone someones business account with no consequences"
Too many fking ads. Ads are fair enough but there are way too many and not enough privacy measures. An ad after every three posts
"No option to log out. With Instagram accounts being hacked at such a high frequency, the app developers should find a way to make the app useful when your account has been compromised. It is a complete hassle and waste of time going through the circles of logging out or changing accounts when they lock your profile. Not even deleting and reloading the app works because Instagram retains your data. No wonder they have such weak security systems"
Updates every week to steal info. Updated every week to steal whatever weve uploaded this week. Its getting old
App runs terrible. I dont know what to say. On wifi. Off wifi. Lots of data available. It crashes. It freezes. It stops loading. Im only complaining Hoping someone will see it and figure it out. When I think it my data/network/phone. I check other apps and they all work great. Instagram has been a huge disappointment for a while
Censorship. The censorship of Palestinian voices in favor of a z10ni5t narrative despite the catalogues oppression and death of the Palestinians under isntr@eli hands is absolutely disgusting as it is obvious And that is besides the fact this application collects more data than any other application in the entire App Store
FIX THE ALGORITHM. This app is driving me nuts..I have a creator account and my own personal account. There is no reason why I shouldnt be able to see the posts from the people Im following. Its all ads or larger accounts posts (that I dont follow) I just want people to see my posts and I want to see other peoples posts. Its not that hard
New update is Wiggity wack wack. Leaving this application done using it complete invasion of what privacy was left
"Perfect App For Non-political Content. Perfect and truly enjoyable user friendly  app when posting personal, business (small business) and non-political content. For everything else need to go elsewhere but for individual and family things cant find anything better"
"The addiction is horrible. Ive taken to deleting the app constantly , and you should too . My mental health / physical health really suffers from the nonsense features meant to destroy our individuality . I hate it . I have hired social media workers because its horrible to be addicted to it . And its ( obviously ) designed to addict us . As an addict in recovery , I say no . And what is reels ? Dumbest feature ever . Dont make your spying on me sooooo obvious . Also ? Your getting into dangerous my space - end of era territory with granting points  for posting nonsense reels ( off tik tok which Ill never use ) and giving  demerits  minus points ( points being Instagram likes my followers - knows me - or thinks it does - so itll get more followers for me by dumping me into people it thinks will follow mes feed ) the minus ? If I post , decide I got a tag or a phrase wrong , edit the post ? Then IG  subtracts  points .  If I delete dont archive an old post ? From 2012 IG will  punish me  this is dumb . Your making all of us hate you"
"Incessant censorship & they steal your followers. About a month ago, my follower count was approaching the 2000 mark. As soon as it flipped to what wouldve been 2000 followers, it reset to 1000. These are real followers Ive lost. My page is being censored. Ive had friends complain that they are unable to like my posts or even comment on them, although my privacy settings are set to where anyone can comment or like my page posts. A few years ago, they stole several hundred of my followers and tried to explain it away that they were purging bot accounts but these were my real friends who then had to re-follow me at a later date. Our constitutional right to freedom of speech supersedes your user agreements #MsBlazeInc"
Garbage. Absolute disgrace of an app took the best iPhone app this century and literally did a speed run to ruin it. Only the idiots at Facebook and co could want money so bad they dumbed down their own product so much that even idiots like me think its dumb. Seriously they dont even hide their belief that all were good for is money and data. I think this update went too far. This is no lowest common denominator. This is simply put a predatory app aiming to steal precious waking hours and hard earned money in exchange for likes and landfill garbage sent directly to your home
Your reporting system is broken. Unban Atlas News. Your reporting system is broken and not in line with agreed terms and privacy policies. Atlas News is a legitimate source of news. This must be fixed. 193. 194
Stop collecting data. Thanks
"So many bugs and failures. Last night while checking my feed, not posting anything, the app crashed and logged me out. When I attempted to log back in my entire account had been deleted across all of my devices. The support site said to create a new account and accept that all content has been lost forever. Now I can access the new account because Instagrams phone number verification system has been broken for over 24 hours"
Hacked and no customer service help. My personal account has been hacked into and I forgot my password.. been trying to reset my password and needed assistance.. I emailed and have tried to reach Instagram support but have not received any help
"Merging accounts. Everything was fine until the last updatesPromoting reels and shopping was one thing.But why merging accounts into one? I have my own personal account which is for my actual pictures, which I dont exactly want my followers on my gacha account seeing me or my family for example Please fix this.And instagrams algorithm"
AMAZING.  And some cons. So I love insta.....but I use an iPad to access the app and it has these two ginormous black borders and its really annoyingI know its a phone app but maby you could help some people who have the same problemapart from that I really reccomemd buying it
my account does not have animated text for instastory. been waiting for it to update forever. it&#39;s available on my professional page but not my personal one
Paying Instagram. So just recently I deleted Instagram because of personal reasons and I tried downloading it again and its making me pay which I dont have a card. I would want to know why this is happening and maybe help me out?
Dont like the update. I love Instagram but I dont like this update. Not a fan of the suggested posts that come up on my feed when Im trying to look at what has been posted by the people I follow. And I hate the way Instagram auto aligns the pictures when scrolling through the for you page. Its a personal preference but I find myself using Instagram less because of it
"Great app but Direct messages dont work. Instagram is a great app to share photos and keep up with friends, but I dont get notifications for private messages which is obviously a big part of the app. Gone through phone and app settings which are all turned on for notifications but still doesnt work after months"
"Whats going on?. I just tried to log into my account after Instagram app dropped me out. Told me my password was incorrect and when I tried to creat a new password with the forgot password link it goes to an email I dont recognize. Now I have no way of knowing what is going on with my account. What happened with this latest update? Cant rely on any social media when they are constantly being hacked. Just spent 4 hours trying to figure out how to log back onnothing. No customer service, no help email, and no phone number to call to do something. Im done trying to justify keeping this nonsense"
"Instagram locked me out. I dont understand, my Instagram doesnt let me back in and it has been over 24 hours and its my personal Instagram. I love my Instagram and I thought the app was great until this happened. Ive been trying to contact Instagram for support and help getting my account back and nothing"
ig problems. My page on instagram (where my pictures are) isnt loading and ive tried everything deleting the app and re-downloading the app but nothing works
"Users Cant Share My Story. Long time personal Instagram user here making the foray into starting a professional account. This alone is complicated enough, but I seem to have the added difficulty now of trouble with other users sharing my story to their own stories. Ive probably spent hours scouring the Internet for a solution. Ive logged out, logged back in, uninstalled, reinstalled, turned the phone off, turned it back on, toggled switches off, toggled them back on, etc. My share settings are on (both via message and post) but to no avail. This is frustrating and really shouldnt be"
"Account hacked- zero customer support. My account was hacked, and there is absolutely no customer support to help you regain access to your account. Not only are my pictures lost but my friends are made vulnerable to cyber attacks as well"
"Cant DM my own cousins???. I have opened my Instagram as personal blog/vlog to help develop not only a future business but also interact with the people of my country. I have not even gotten that many followers but as some of them have met me in the streets, they rather give me their insta than their phone numbers which I understand. But now that my DM doesnt work, I cannot contact any of these people who DO want me to contact them What is going on???? I thought Instagram was great at connecting people ?"
"Was good but then. Moving the main navigation like what happened in a new update was TERRIBLE It is now SO ANNOYING to get to the notifications screen, which i daresay is the most used area asid from your personal feed. I wanted to add that the appeal of Instagram, was the fact that it WASNT like typical social media. It was SIMPLE. It was easy to use, was a system of likes and shares.every new update after the direct messaging was added, has been FRUSTRATING, anti- user experience, and quite frankly sometimes makes me spitting MAD What you have done with the algorithm is HORRIBLE. There are so many posts from people I follow, that I just do not see And now the algorithm is WORSE??"
Hack. Someone got into my account and posted my pictures Idk who this guy is but this app is not safe be careful please
"Wont let me edit profile. This app really has no support and no help. I have been unable to change my profile, any part of it, for the past 5 months. I am unable to change my profile picture, bio, name, etc. I am also unable to change my privacy settings to a private account which is very stressful. It is not only that but I also see 0 notifications. It is unfortunate that Instagram has not done anything about it. I have reported the problem numerous times and have never heard back and nothing has changed. I even tried to submit an application to be verified and just complained and they still did nothing. This app is terrible and has absolutely no support system. They need to figure out a stronger and more helpful response team before moving further. I have waited 5 months for a response and have gotten nothing. There is no reason to try to report a problem when you are sending the problem to no one. It is dissapointing as this used to be a well managed app, but unfortunately I have been simply frustrated at them. I would love if Instagram could help me, but we all know thatll never happen"
"Gets worse with each update. I am getting really frustrated every time instagram updates. My most recent beef is with tagged notifications. If someone tags you in a photo, you will get notified every time someone comments. My phone has been blowing up all week from tagged pictures at an event and it is just so frustrating to have 40 notifications an hour of @ commented on a post you were tagged in"
"Inaccurate restrictions???. Honestly Ive enjoyed using the app from all its features but lately I cant get past the irritation of constantly having my account restricted for trying to gain followers, however I have now way attempted to do that at any point in time, yet constantly my account is restricted and it becomes very irritating. My accounts are either personal or for art and I was really looking forward to working back in my art account but things have gotten beyond irritating with my account getting blocked or restricted. I have looked into the reasonings behind whats happening and such and maybe how to avoid it or why you get restricted, yet Im not guilty for any of it. At first I thought I could brush it off however Ive gotten so irritated that Ive decided to delete the app for now and see if it ever fixes itself later on. I have hope for the half decent app but for now its frustrated me more than it should"
"So much fuN. I love to post pictures of my dog, and since I have private account creeps cant see anything Only my friends and family. So far, I have to no complaints"
Professional account and Personal Account - Thy House & Kyra Clark. I appreciate how reliable this app is structurally
Bunch a bull. You see everyones accounts are getting hacked and forced to create new pages You want our feedback but not doing anything about identitys being stolen or saying you dont see an issue
Stupid app spying on us. Never recommended this is a spyware
Someone is hacking everyone. Someone is hacking everyone saying someone did something to our  photos
"Disappointed in new TOS. So disappointed in the new terms of service, especially instagrams data collecting and the recent law suit over recording through the front camera. Horrified by how the new TOS will impact sex workers"
Instagram Reels. This is my personal instagram account and i am not getting the option of instagram reels in my account. So please update the reels on my account
"Instagram Music Story. Up until a couple days ago my music sticker for storys was working fine, and i could search up any song. One day i press the stickers and instead of giving me the suggested for you it gave me a bunch of royalty free music. I logged out, then i logged back in. I switched my account back to a personal account, ive made it private and public. Ive even deleted the app and re-downloaded it. It still wasnt working, I use the music sticker pretty often. Its not just me with this problem, people who are also having this issue are very annoyed and mad. Please fix this"
"its ok but. posting stories/actually using the app racks up so much extra documents and data that i have to constantly uninstall and reinstaill because it makes my phone run out of memory.ETA: now up to 189MB just to download it, before the extra data that piles up. thats too much"
"Show me all the people I follow. All I can see lately are the big meme-type accounts and brand/product accounts. Nothing from personal accounts of people I actually know unless I go search them out. Ive gone through and tried to change settings to limit how much I see of those accounts, but it hasnt seemed to help. Please show me everything"
"I see ways you could improve the app.  I would consider possibly updating the camera features to where the cameras face filters will track the face from all angles like the code behind Apple&#39;s Face ID face tracking does.  Also, another improvement I would suggest is adding ways to customize the camera settings for Instagram Stories. Such as the ability to flip the camera to the reverse mirror image to mimic the rear camera effect rather than only being able to take a picture from the perspective of a mirror"
"Not safe. Ive had Instagram for many years. I made my first one probably 8-9 years ago and Ive always used it. Recently a man hacked into my account and began to request naked pictures. Of course I tried so hard to contact Instagram but nothing has happened. After being sexually harassed myself, this man took it a step further and began using my account to talk to my little sister who is a minor and asking her for pictures as well. He also used my Instagram to hack into my other friends profiles and he actually video chatted my little sister off my account that he hacked. I answered the call and he did not like that so he hung up, continued to harass both me and my little sister through dm, and threatening to post private drafts I had saved on my profile. Im making this review in an attempt to share how negligent instagram has been towards this situation. Ive tried so hard to get them to remove my account that was hacked. I dont even have interest in the account anymore, I just prefer it not to be in the hands of a random man that is sexually harassing people (including minors). Something needs to be done about this The app doesnt feel safe anymore"
"fix instagram. i have more than one account, i have my personal account and another account for business and i dont know whether it has something to do with the new update but now my instagram is not working. it started with me having to put my phone number into all accounts and use a code but on one of the accounts it didnt work. now i cant log into my personal account and all i can see when i enter the app is a black screen with the loading sign in the centre. instagram is a really good way to express what you are doing and message friends and family. fix the app immediately"
"App is deteriorating. Ive been on Instagram since 2011, love the app and sharing bits of my life but its function has gone downhill for the past year plus. I have two accounts one personal, one for the company I work for. In my personal account, I still dont have access to watching or uploading reels and have reached out multiple times to figure out why this feature isnt working. I also have lost the ability to reshare posts, which from what I understand, is Instagrams way of forcing users to be intentional about what is reshared. What is frustrating is that I seem to be left in a group that is forgotten about. Going between accounts and seeing the different functionalities is extremely frustrating. But what is more frustrating is that support is nonexistent. I have never received a response or update as to why reels arent functional for me. Wish they would be more responsive and I wouldve rated much higher"
No Reels Or Music Option. I have 2 accounts and for some reason despite having the same info I dont have reels or music on one even though I did have it for my first post  Ive reported the issue various times and no helpI also had to create new accounts because my old account was hacked and even though I also tried to report that several times IG has helped me get my account back . Not only that. Even though myself and my followers have been reporting my hacked account IG says its not going against community guidelines. The hacker is even messaging my followers threatening to Jacky heir account too
Frustrating . Can you guys work Im not disabling accounts that dont need to be disabled either on my old account I got disabled for no reason I told Instagram it mustve been a mistake NO REPLY BACK. More people are starting to get disabled that I know people with 1M and when people get hacked instagrams team doesnt do anything unless youre Kylie Jenner  this app is raising my anxiety .Also today i tried to go on it and it keeps kicking me out the app even when I download and redown load it .And its not like its my phone I have an iPhone 11 with ios14
Story Views & Post Reshares. We should always be able to see who watched our story. It shouldnt disappear after 24hrs when its our personal account. Post reshares need to be more accessible on all public accounts. I have a Public Figure account and I cant find the View Story Reshares anywhere
Invasive Terms of Service. Deleted it. IGs new terms of service are a complete invasion of users privacy
"Swipe left for DMs GONE. I HATE that you cant swipe left anymore to see your DMs with the newest update. Too much effort to click the DM button on the top right if the screen. ***UPDATE: Apparently they force you to share microphone and camera in order to use the swipe left feature for DMs. Once you turn it back on, the swiping is enabled. I hate Meta so much. They activate camera and microphone whenever they want. Hate meta Facebook and Instagram, i cant WAIT until TikTok and new competitors destroy you. TikTok isnt big on privacy either. Hopefully apple comes out with new social media platforms with TRUE privacy and commitment"
Photos. Its great and all but my photos have started not loading and to see if it was a problem with my phone I restarted it repeatedly. My WiFi is fine and so is my cellular data but my photos just wont load anymore
No one helps. Ive written serval messages asking for help regarding a problem where I dont have the option to reshare a post on to my story regardless of account privacy
So poor options. This application is so poor option wiseLike FBCustomer and his options is lowest priority for themIf your friend And family are here use itOtherwise there are many better applications Here you can not even chose size of pictures if you change the orientation of ipad your videos will stop  You can not minimize your video easily and check other things ..We use TELEGRAM its option is way better user friendly
"No support. This is my first app review that I have ever posted. My account keeps going down and newsfeed does not refresh for multiple days at a time. Support has been contacted numerous times with no response. I cannot even delete my account if I tried. This app is a huge violation of security and privacy. Developers will not do anything about glaring bugs. This will probably get buried with the mountains of bot reviews, but I wouldnt recommend this service to anyone"
Security codes. I recently started a second account to help sell some clothes I have and Instagram randomly logged me out of the account and asked for a confirmation that it was truly me. I was fine with that until the security code was never sent to my number (which is connected to the account) and now I cant access the new account or my main account or even use the app. Ive tried emailing and calling and have yet to receive help
TIKTOK is better. Instagram is becoming the worst app ever It has no video editing features - plus the new CEO only cares about collecting your data Tiktok make is easier to édité videos For some basic features like changing color of the background you will have to find your way around More over the application is laggy and bug most of the time when creating a Reel (and ig doesnt make it easy for us to do so ) Ive lost more than 7 times more than 2 hours of work because their app is bad
Disabled account with no response. Instagram took down my personal beer page stating that I was pretending to be someone else. I have submitted forms and havent heard anything from Instagram. I had over 7k followers and very upset that they are not responding back. please give me access back to my page @911beerme that was wrongfully taken away
"A little stupid. Somebody hacked my account of 7k followers, I made all the process to try to get it back and instagram didnt make anything.. You tag someone or make multiple likes in a determined time ( can be by mistake sometimes) and instagram block your account, so you guys are ok with people stealing account but not with normal accounts that just share original content??? If I could I would give you guys half star"
"So buggy. Since Ive had this iPhone my Instagram has never allowed my notifications through no matter how many times I reset them or uninstall the app and check the notification settings, its also more recently developed a fault where whenever I like a picture, the like just gets removed so I have to re-like it"
"Used to be so good. This app used to be great, but now you are not even loading the content. This seems like a full blown retaliation rather than a bug, to apple giving us the rights to stop you making a profit off of our data, which is only going to hurt your bottom line in the long run.Do better"
"reshare sticker. i normally wouldnt rate an app this low for one problem but the whole reason i even use instagram was because of how easy the share button was, id spend hours scrolling and sharing posts to my story but now it feels like a chore to just post a single post on my story and i dont want to have to take a picture every time, its annoying and there really isnt any point in using the instagram app anymore for me if sharing posts isnt convenient"
Followers cant share my story. I dont have an option Allow followers to share stories in the privacy section. I dont understand why its disabled in my account. Most of friends have that option
"Ayuda. Me encanta instagram y lo uso tanto personal como para trabajarNecesito hacer publicidad con ustedes con mis post pero no puedo, me dice que esta restringido y no entiendoGracias"
"Disappointing. Basically, I have two accounts, both accounts are private. On my main account I cannot hide like counts on my posts since it was released. As I do not have the option, I also dont have the option on privacy/posts or the option on advanced settings. I have deleted and re-installed the app multiple times and also have changed my password. Where as on my other account I can hide likes and have all the options above which is strange. I have also noticed on my main account that my likes and story views are drastically lower which is annoying and confusing. I have reported this multiple times and havent heard anything back. I cannot seek support. I am not really happy about this as I am a regular instagramer"
"Frustrating to open my current account on a new phone because my old phone broke. I spent a good part of the afternoon re - downloading the app , typing in email , clicking forgotten password , adding my cell number to no avail. The help desk info I googled could. Or pinpoint not address my need. Then I found a customer rep number. Guess what ? They didnt answer my call and direct to online  help . I was able to SEAMLESSLY download Twitter and iTunes with all my saved data. BUT NOT Instagram. I would give the app a negative star if I could. Terrible customer service"
First Time User. I am so excited to learn how to use this tech platform. A girlfriend taught me how to use on a mini vacay. Cant wait to share my journey with friends and family. A better platform for sharing personal highlights than Twitter. 
Horrible new update. The new reels page is clearly to imitate TikTok and draw TikTok users to Instagram rather then TikTok. They have a whole new tab strictly for shopping . Capitalism at its worst. How dumb do you think we are? We are the product and you are trying to squeeze us for as much money as you can possibly take. I hate this so much. Im deleting the app so that my data and time will not be spent contributing to massive and unethical corporations
"Glitch and error issues. Im not happy with the app. It keeps giving me issues with stories music, camera selfie going green, not being able to upload or edit my profile. Its a mess. Ive made reports and I never hear back from them nor are they ever fixed I have a business account and I had to go to personal to fix all those errors. Its super not convenient for a business and growing my business Instagram please do something about this Ive had to make new accounts and still similar or same issues, like whats going on???"
"Need a favor?. Is there any way that this app can help me log into my Facebook, I know longer have my old number which is (662)242-8282. Every time I try to long in I do the privacy situation to get back on but it never goes thru. I done the picture setting many occasions when I take a picture of myself holding up certain numbers that Facebook gives me to proceed with getting my account updated. Help needed if able to, please and thank you a lot."
"This is very annoying. Every time I press the Instagram app icon it doesnt work I have done everything even restarting my phone and cleaning it of data, but it still doesnt work. I dont know if yall have a glitch in the system thats doing this but it is very aggravating"
"New account not letting me post pictures. Started a new personal Instagram account and IG deletes my pictures instantly, have done everything suggested online but still not working , no pictures are offensive in anyway . Been happening for over a week , i give up "
"Fix Issues Please. Im trying to finish connecting my Facebook and Instagram account so I can sell my items on Shopify on my Instagram but it keeps saying theres a problem connecting, we are working on it as soon as we can, Well hopefully soon is immediately cuz this is stopping me in my tracks Please make connecting your business accounts more smoother"
Cant find people I know due to all the make up names. Cant reshare a post. Tired of apps stealing data
"Disabled Account. I recently reported a fake account using my pictures, they disabled my personal account, Ive appealed, Ive done so many forms, all forms contain an error to submit. Instagram needs to fix this issue"
"Awful harassment and deactivated. IG deleted my account bc I reported harassment by another account. Theres no way I can reactivate my account and no way to contact IG. Understand: theres no one you can appeal or talk to if someone is violently threatening you, trying to get you fired, sexually harassing you etc. IG is as likely to take your account down as the harasser. And theres no email or phone number to rectify the situationand who knows what the do with the data? So you can build up a business, 1000s of followers, and IG can blink you away in the snap of an eye using AI and there literally NOTHING you can do about it"
"My Account was hacked last week. I still love Instagram but you need better security because I got fooled and clicked on a link on my friends Instagram who was hacked and I didnt know and got hacked even though I have 2 step verification. They changed my username, password, email, and phone number and have all my personal information and who knows address. I warned my friends and family who follow me that I was hacked and people are asking for money saying I got a spanking new Mercedes with bitcoin which is a lie. My cousin found out the hacker is in Canada but idk How I can fixed my account I even tried creating a new one with no number and a different email but it still somehow was hacked"
"IG is deleting comments, restricting activity. IG is constantly giving me an error message after every time I post a comment. It is also deleting comments from people that stand for a FREE PALESTINE and the same people that stand against anti semitism. This is a violation of our digital privacy. IG is not doing its due diligence and deleting and reporting comments that do not have any foul language, any hate, any negativity but simply a dialogue"
story music issue. i love instagram but i use to be a business account ive recently changed back to a personal account and i still dont have access to all the music i use to have how do i fix this ive tried everything
"Creepy. They now have access to all devices and those around? Including my friends and family, that have NOT given you permission? And my camera? I dont like the idea of you spying on or seeing my children changing. Like a creepy stalker? Not to mention we arent allowed to have any opinions other than yours. Bye bye app"
Used to awesome before fb. The app used to awesome before fb acquired it and made it into a money making app. The app is not free considering the amount of data they track and ads I have to see. Honestly I feel I should be paid for using this app
Privacy. I think the explore page should be removed and I think you should be able to block all of a persons followers so they wont follow you after youve blocked that person
"No notifications & not loading. I have the iphone11 plus and ever since I got this phone I have not gotten a single notification for Instagram. Ive checked everything and nothing changes. As for not loading anything, this started yesterday. I havent been able to load new posts, look for accounts, and my page has blank pictures"
a very negative review. i HATE the intrusive ads. i hate having to take a photo of myself AND give a phone number in order to log back in. Instagram was fun before Facebook took over and messed up the algorithms. I also hate that the like button was moved to the top. I dont shopand I wont. And today i cant access likes on any pages. Ill never update this app againit just gets worse
"Lovely app but. Way too many ads, way too much invasion of privacy. Good job ruining everything zuckerberg"
Bad algorithm. This new updated algorithm makes it so hard to see any posts from people you actually like and follow. Very frustrating since it basically forces the discover feed onto whats supposed to be only your personal feed. Makes no sense
"Not receiving notifications. I checked both my phones and Instagram settings notifications, and everything is on. But i still wont get notifications at all. I even deleted the app and downloaded it again. Still didnt work"
Extremely toxic to ones mental health. Do not download this app unless you want to lose track of your hopes and dreams and are eager to have pointless distractions in your face every single day stopping you from being the person you want to be this app makes you feel horrible yes the algorithm shows things that we like over and over and over however I do not feel like that is healthy
Deleted my account. New update is invasive to privacy. I deleted my account and will not be going back
Hacked account. Recently had a hacked account and my phone number was removed and account email changed . Tried multiple times and Instagram has done absolutely nothing to help me . The person on my account is still pretending to be me and cause issues and I can't do anything about it . I even tried messaging Instagram proof and nothing . Probably going to delete this app
Instagram Reels. This is my Personal Instagram Account. I am not getting the option of Instagram Reels in my account. So please enable Instagram reels option in my account
"Old version was better. Instagram should bring back the number of likes on a post - especially for personal accounts. Maybe make it ambiguous on celebrity/business accounts but it makes sense for small/personal accounts to see the number of likes.Update:Why is there a shopping page? I do not use Instagram for shopping. It is not a shopping app, it is a social media app. Please remove this feature; especially on personal accounts"
"Music rights issue on account. Hello Please help I have sent several messages in regarding using music on reels and stories and I still can not use mainstream songs. I have abided by privacy rules please help. This is my business. Thank you fir your time, God Bless"
Locked out of my account. Ive been locked out of my account for no reason at all im trying to figure out how its not letting me log in i know my password all i did was update my phone number to my account because i no longer have access to that number or email and now its not letting me log in. I cant even log in using my facebook which is linked to my instagram account as well. I need hell ASAP my ig accoun is bruce_peelee_roy
"No notifications. Since the update I no longer get push notifications for direct messages. I have tried logging out, changing my password, reinstalling the app, updating my iPhone, restarting my iPhone. I have contacted Instagram 3x no response.Also not getting any kind of notification when people follow me. thank god for third party tracking apps"
Filters are not working. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this Instagram App and the filters still are not working. I reset my phone and also data off load. Still the filters are not working
instagram stories. this past week i havent been able to add the music i like to my insta story. it keeps say that the music isnt there like it never existed. and its saying its because i have a business acc but u switched it to personal and still nothing. ive deleted the app like 4 times and it still doesnt work. please fix this problem
"FIX YOUR MISTAKE. Its not your users fault that your platform was HACKED.  We dont even know what information of our was shared and with whom it may have been shared to, the least you can do is grant us access to our accounts, some of which we rely on as a source on income as its something people use to share their artwork, clothing, etc and run businesses"
"this app makes me mad. I love instagram okay, i have two accounts. One for all my close friends to see personal things, like i let things out on there to not hold them in. The other is like im cute, account where i post the GOOD pictures. now this is where my problem is, on my personal account i have all the music i want to put on my story. on my other account i will search a song that is available on my other page but it says no searches found. LIKE WHAT I have logged in and out twice, and i uninstalled it and installed it again. Nothing changes, I have reported this problem with Instagram twice already. Haven&#39;t heard anything since. Before anyone says is it updated? YES IT IS"
"idk if its just me or. ok so this has been bugging me for hoursssss.... i cant refresh my feed, its been loading for several minutes each time i try. i tried closing the app, turning on data, turning off my WiFi on mine then turning it on... i dont think its a connection problem because my WiFi is fine on everything else, i tried getting close to my router, STILL NOT LOADING. tried restarting my phone. NOTHING. i tried instagram on the website. IT WORKS. its weird mine isnt and it was working fine earlier until i noticed i wasnt able to watch a video a friend sent me. THIS SUCKSSSSS"
"I need help with the notifications. Hey, can someone help me, I don&#39;t get the Instagram notifications, I tried everything, install and uninstall the app several times and check the iphones settings and the notifications still do not arrive"
Post sharing option not showing up?. Ive been using this app for years and havent had much issues. I saw that the option to share feed posts to my story is no longer listed when I tap the paper plane icon. Ive looked at my settings to make sure I had the correct options chosen but the problem persists. Ive tried to see if it has anything to do with privacy settings on the accounts I want to share but the option wont show up even with an account I know is public. This is an issue across all my Instagram accounts and its making interactions with other users posts via stories impossible
"Action blocked??. I had the day off and spent more time than usual on Instagram and it started blocking me from liking my friends pictures or following/unfollowing people. When I looked up why it was happening online, I read that its because Instagram thinks Im using bots. Ive never used bots. I have a personal Instagram account with like 600 followers. Nowhere near those massive bot-supported commercial accounts that Instagram apparently thinks I have. It really upsets me that Instagram punishes people just for enjoying their app. I messaged the Instagram official account and never received any reply. Very disappointed"
"Awful usability, development and features. Where do I begin? This would have been rejected in the late 90s. There are no video controls, no audio controls, nothing can be full screen. Everything is low res. Video formats are restrictive and have to be at least 60 seconds long. You have to upload photos from a phone and cant from a computer. You cant advance to the next image or collection without going up one level in navigation first. I have no idea how this platform became so popular when so many others are completely superior. Flickr lets you post any size with exif information, location data, etc. Im sure there are many pointless limitations Ive left out. Its hard to remember them all"
Almost Perfect. everything almost always just runs super smooth for me on this end other than the fact that my instagram wont update and have to features that others do. for example i cant repost other posts to my story. on my business instagram i cant but only personal i can so i dont understand
"Ive been hacked and I need help. My last hope. Ive been hacked the person who hacked me , changed my username , the phone number and email associated with my account. So this person completely took over and is now pretending to be me and asking my followers for money. This person is now hacking my friends as well. Ive already emailed instagram multiple times, sent them a picture of me along with my ID, I also sent two videos of my face to confirm my identity but nothing has been done to get this person off of instagram or Maybe if Instagram were to delete my old account so this person can stop hacking other people that would be enough to me. I hope this review helps somehow because now its messing with my mental, Ive never thought this would ever happen to me"
"Instagram Glitch. I have been trying to contact Instagram for support for a week now. I logged into my account one day and it said help us confirm you own this account I clicked on send security code and a error messages keeps saying sorry there was a problem, try again I dont know what to do or who to contact. I have access to my email and phone that was used to create the account. But Instagram wont let me get access. This isnt even my fault can anyone help me??"
"INSTAGRAM GOT MY HACKED ACCOUNT BACK. After being scammed out of my account by someone I know whos account was also scammed and I was unaware,  my recovery email and phone number was changed and I couldnt do anything.  Instagram received my request about the situation and updated my recovery info which let me back into my account.  I couldnt believe it I had to write a review"
Super disappointed with Instagram. Instagram has had so many terrible updates that make it so frustrating to use. The music doesnt even work. Concerned about privacy as well. The help center doesnt even respond. One of my favorite social media apps has became my least favorite social media app. Super disappointed and hoping that the old Instagram will come back
"Hacked account. Instagram please help my account was hacked I cant even login into it they jacked my account & changed my email & phone number , the way my Instagram was back then Id still the same they just use it to scam people by using cash app & Zelle for it & uploading of me saying try it out when I never did that at all please help you guys are a big organization & that fact that youll take forever to help is ridiculous just help me please"
"Instagram. I need to understand why I can not access my saved posts on both my accounts. At first I thought it was an issue with my phone but I signed in with another phone, did not work. I deleted cache, logged out then deleted and proceeded to redownload but same issue. You have to help me out here Is this a bug????"
"Cant share ANY stories on Instagram. Hello Instagram Im having issues with my story. It seems that I can not share ANYONES  stories and I mean anyone (even ppl with this setting off) . Im not understanding why I have this problem. I understand its different if that person page is private or has that sharing stories settings off but its for everything I cant share anything . My friends pics or memes, Celebrities stuff cute animal pictures and even my own post cant be shared Like I can not add anything to my instagram story.Please help. I deleted that app and re-downloaded it. I changed my private settin to public . Restarted my phone Im unsure now"
Do not update. bye privacy
"App auto refresh. You guys should create a photo post privacy. I know the stories has the option already, it would be great if the actual posts had the same option"
"Disabled for unknown reasons?. Ive since had my Instagram account disabled for unknown reasons. Its been a week and every time Ive reached out, Ive heard nothing. Theyll disable my little personal account but let the bots and porn accounts run wild"
"Glitch. Theres some sort of glitch where sometimes it wont let me like and pictures and Ill get a notification saying my like was blocked because of a privacy issue or something, and the same thing with following people"
"Cant share my own business IGs stories but everyone else can. Frustrating to use at times, especially when I cant share my own videos from my business account to my personal accounts story because I dont have that feature for some reason. Everyone else can do it but me. Looked all over and nothing will work"
I am not happy. Hello my name is Kameryn Freeman and this is regarding my personal account ka.mmss. I have been trying instagram support and it is not working. I wont stop until i get access to my account back preferably before i graduate May 25. I have been dealing with this for two days now. I try to sign into my account which has the two factor authentication. When i insert any of the text codes it doesnt work. I got an email for support telling me to use a specific backup code. Every time i under the code it gives me an error message saying sorry there was a problem with your request. I need to get back into my account. It is the main way that I contact my dorm roommate for the 2021-2022 school year. If you could call or email me and we can get this sorted out soon I greatly appreciate it. I have been with Instagram for some time now and would like to stay. Thank you for your help and speedy response. Not the mention the terrible costumer service. This could have been resolved a while ago if i could get in contact with a real person
Dont waist your time. Instagram done deleted my page for nothing I woke up to get on Instagram and my page is gone I tried to log in it said I couldnt I have personal things in there that doesnt need to get out  So I want my page back or INSTAGRAM people contact me  Or Im sewing Instagram 
Pls fix this. I have been having trouble accessing the list which shows who Im following and I cannot see who others are following either. The message that pops up says something like user data cannot be found or you need to start following someone
"Unopened messages. I have several direct messages I have acknowledged and opened multiple times and they still show as notifications on the app. I have actually removed the app from my  phone because it bothered me so much. I love Instagram, but I hate the excess notifications"
Bad update. Ive switched to personal account and when I want music its nothing good. Until this issue is fixed my rate will not be going up. Ill update when Instagram support reaches out
Fix this. It says I cant use music as Im a business account put Im personal and not allowing me to access it
"Instagram bug making it less fun to use. I spend a good amount of time on IG every day for work and personal reasons. Recently, my account has not been able to share posts to story (not from private accounts) and its been impacting my work Please turn back on this function for my account. I need it for work. These glitches make me wish I didnt have to use Instagram"
"Issues with Stories. I created a second account so that I could follow some of my favorite artists and also so that I could create Guides, which my personal account did not allow me to do. In addition, I also cannot access the Saved Music feature in Stories on my second account. Instagram needs to fix this soon"
"Tried Instagram recently. I thought I would try Instagram instead of Facebook and I had a guy start asking me personal questions and for a picture. Even though I told him that I was married, he asked how long I had been using online dating sites. I didnt think Instagram was an online dating site; so I quit it"
"Facebook ruined Instagram. Edit: Facebook ruined Instagram. If its not broke, dont fix it. It use to be so amazing. I hate the new layout. Sneaky shoving more ad content in our face by mixing up the old home buttons on our personal feed. I also hate that every 3rd photo is an ad. This platform is just... ugh. WhyyyyyyyLiking the save link feature. Not a fan of the snapchat like update and wish there was an option to revert back to chronological order...but most improvements have been made for the better. Good job IG. Now just fix the ghost followers thing or make a way to report follow bots They drive me crazy"
ALL IT DOES IS CRASH. Whats the point now? It crashes constantly since the new update.My Instagram keep crashing over and over every time I click on the about me section. I have to do it by clicking on a picture to access my page instead of clicking on the button.I also have photos
What happened?. I have not been able to access my personal Instagram for weeks now. I can access my pages for my artists/ musicians page but not the personal account
"My account was locked for no reason. Help Ive had Instagram for quite some time and I run a few fan pages. Well one day I was trying to get onto one of my fan pages and it said it was locked. I tried re setting the password, deleting Instagram and re downloading it, I tried to send myself the code to move on with my personal information but nothing was working. I am not happy with whats going on. I have no clue what I did to have my account locked. I really want the account back and Instagram isnt doing anything to fix it"
"The worst customer service ever. Ive had IG since they started about 11 years ago. I have yearsAnd years of memories of my children, family, and friends. I recently was hacked and my page was temporarily locked. Since my email on my profile was not up-to-date IG told me I could no longer access my page and I have lost all my pictures stories and videos. I have sent tons of emails to their support team trying to prove my identity in order to logon to my page and nobody has responded with trying to help me. You would think for a company that had that much money, they would have better customer service or an actual human being that you can talk to and can help. Im heartbroken that I lost my account with so many wonderful memories. Shame on you Facebook and Instagram for not doing a better job in helping your loyal customers"
. I give it a 5/5 but can we have our privacy like dont use our cams to spy on us thats creepy and kids be on here so plz stop taking our privacy
Promise. I love my Instagram account cause its my personal account I dont want you guys to close or disable my account cause it means a lot to me
Help my account has been hacked. My account on insta has been hacked all the info changed and I cant access or recover it at all please help
Fix privacy please (messages: DM). I have received inappropriate messages from accounts that harassed me inappropriately. Update privacy (private accounts). Block me from people who ask for sexually activity and also sexually harass me
Needs more iOS features. Should concentrate more on adding useful user features (like the new iOS 14 widget) instead of user data gathering by integrating with messenger (which nobody needs except Mark)
"Poor, trash copy/paste. Poor algorithms, trash copy/paste content 90%  useless or fake, zero customer support,  zero credit for content creation, non authorized use of personal data. Skip it"
Music sticker. Ive been using this app for years and now the music sticker has disappeared from my Instagram app.  I dont know if it is a privacy thing but I would like for it to be fixed so I can use it again
Fix IGTV and stop Removing my friends and adding ghost accounts. IGTV keeps disappearing its been doing this for like a month now I have reported it several times to no avail smh Yall must be spying on people cause how are you adding people I dont know to my followers and removing others Invasion of privacy l?
"Worst update I\'ve ever seen in an app. Two new tabs, one for shopping and one purely for reels. Who asked for this? Obviously no one, Instagram just wants to compete with Tik Tok while taking market share from online retail. These changes are made to squeeze more money out of the app as apparently ads and farming our data isn&#39;t an effective enough model"
facebook ruined it. ever since facebook bought this app theres been nothing but problems. sorry metaverse ruined it. it doesnt keep track of what posts ive seen so i scroll past the same 12 posts looking for the one new posts
Fix your stupid hacking problem. I was hacked and it sent adult photos to my family stop selling my info jerks
"Very intrusive ads. Worried about my privacy. Whenever I a view something online on a completely different machine , I start seeing related Ads on my phone in this App.This is very worrying"
"Instagram delete my personal account for no reason. Ive had the account for 11 years and have so many memories that have all been lost, I havent done anything and havent even been posting recently. Please help me get my account back, theres no way to contact anyone, I dont know it was hacked or what has happened. Please help me"
DO NOT UPDATE. I have been using Instagram for almost a year now and l loved that I could change the theme of my chats and have the information icon for easy access to mute or block someone. With the latest update I can not change the theme nor do I have the little information icon. Other problems Ive had with updating is being unable to see old posts
New updated version. Hi i still havent gotten the new updated version that everyone has on my regular personal account I see people who can tag each other on posts and collaborate and I cant do that on my account and Instagram was updated a few days ago please fix i would love to tag someone and have it go on their grid also i think thats pretty cool
"I need HELP. Im not able to get not type of notifications from both of my accounts, I already logged out on both of them , reinstalled Instagram, rest my phone and no used"
"I hope instagram sees this. My account has been hacked multiple times and I have had to change my password more than you know. My account just got disabled because it got hacked once again and according to instagram help if someone hacks your account and disabled it there is no getting it back. I honestly think this is absolutely ridiculous how un-secure instagram security system is and I also find it ridiculous how I am unable to contact anyone from instagram. Ive tried email, phone, help center and nothing works. Instagrams online help center doesnt do anything because all it has is frequently asked questions. The questions I have are not faqs and I need help from a real legitimate person to talk to. Thank you, Instagram do better"
"Ads post to my story option is disabled. I dont have add post to my story option and my ig story stops after 15 s and wont keep filming.These problems has been happening to me since  i got my iPhone, and the worst thing is that I manage many ig accounts and ONLY MINE PERSONAL ONE has this issues. Ive sent a lot of report and havent received any feedback. I cant share any post from others to my story, not even my own post (It shows up like: this account is private) Please Instagram, PLEASE Notice MY PROBLEM AND FIX IT"
"Horrible customer support. Instagram was my fav app to use. But one day I was logged out of all my accounts and when I was prompted to sign in, insta messages on my personal account stopped working . I have tried to reach out to the customer support multiple times and have received no response. It makes me very sad to use the app now. Wish I could reach out to someone and get the account fixed"
"music. i was a business account just for fun but switched to personal after instagram got rid of good music for business accs. ive deleted the app, logged in and out, logged into different tech, nothing works. im literally a private personal account now and still am not getting the music selection. please fix this asap"
What is going on???. I have a personal account and 2 business accounts it allows me to play whatever music I can think of on my personal account story but when I try and put music up from my business accounts it doesnt let me pick whatever song I want loads of random songs that I havent even heard of come up
"Update . I just got the update last night for the pronouns featured in the personal bio Its super meaningful and important. I love how it works, and its very inclusive"
"Never get new features. I love using Instagram for business purposes but I never seem to get the new features until monthssss later? Like reels for instance , I have it on my personal accord but not on my main business account ? Not sure why or how to fix it and its so frustrating"
"Instagram is not on your side. My relative had his account hacked and they changed the email address. They then impersonated him continuously (to this day still) targeting his family and friends for money. Multiple calls and emails to Instagram has led to nothing. They simply say because the email doesnt match any longer (scam artists changed it) they wont do a single thing. Contacting the scam artist only leads to threats of violence. There are pictures of ID, multiple posts of his personal pictures and other ways he tried to prove it was his account and yet they refuse to help. The account has been reported for fraud and scams probably over 100 times at this point and yet the support team is utterly useless. If you ever get hacked and your account stolen Im sorry to say Instagram will not help in any way"
"Instagram not taking down fake accounts. So whenever I come across a fake account, I report them for stealing pictures. Well Instagram asks that I give the profile of whomever the pictures were stolen from. Well so far every single time I have searched for the profile, it doesnt show up. Its really strange. Why is the ONLY profile that I cannot use as a witness the one that never shows up when asked who's photos were taken. Has anyone else had this problem??"
"2020 so far, too much unwanted spam. Unfortunately, not a business tool. Second attempt , first couple art account was hacked and deleted.Lost all my contacts and couple of K followers. Instagram never got back at me, started a new account for art. My explore page is filled with lame spam and animal abuse tiktok videos. Keep clicking report. Its everywhere"
App isnt working for one of three accounts. I recently switched my personal account to a business account and now I cant share posts to my story. The option isnt available for accounts I specifically know I am supposed to be able to share from and Instagram hasnt been answering my support requests. Its been this way for a month now and is so frustrating because now its affecting my business. I use another account on the same device and it works
New terms of service are a handmaids tale. The new terms of service are so unbelievably privacy violating and anti human nature. No hinting at sex with emojis?? IG allowed to analyze your face camera and DMs and contact lists? Im genuinely frightened by the implications. Get off this app and connect to the people you love IRL while you still can
Worst app ever. Have you seen their new rules? Talk about no privacy What a joke
Notifications. I love the app but I reported a while back that I do not get notifications of any kind from this app. Ill be texting family and leave the app and it doesnt notify when I receive a message. Its quite aggravating when I am having an important conversation because I have to just keep the app open forever during the conversation
Someone hacked my account I hate instagram. Worse app ever
Good but could be better. It would be great to have additional privacy features such as being able to use Face ID to unlock the app
"Ig. Really good, but sometimes irritating if you own a meme page as I wanted to unfollow everyone but got blocked for a bit, but then the block carries on to my personal acc which is really annoying"
"Not getting notifications please help. I been having problems with my notifications on instagram and Im not getting them. I already checked instagrams notifications and my phones notifications, they are all on and Im still not getting them ( I even updated my phone but Im still not getting the notifications if you can please help me"
Viruses. My account was hacked and had sent a virus link to everyone on my friends list which forced me to change my password and everything so now I have to deal with the embarrassment and potential theft of my other personal accounts
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i got this app a few years back and up until now it was really great. recently (since quarantine) ive not been able to change my bio, name, or go from a business to a personal account so i can go private. ive emailed everyone i van about these problems with only one of my accounts (my main one) and ive been completely ignored, its no use, i am not happy"
"Im not allowed to make a new account. I tried to log back into my account (marleyiscrazy) but I entered the right phone number and it said it gave me a code that I never received. So I tried to make a new account with my moms Facebook e-mail and Name and it did the crossway puzzle picture things and it said Welcome To Instagram, (username but I forgot), and then literally 5 secs after I accepted it said oops something went wrong but I did press sign up and create a new account but it didnt work. So Instagram HQ, delete all the data from my IG: marleyiscrazy and please give me the opportunity to make a new one.                    Sincerely,                                      ~Marley"
"You cannot censor or fact check someones personal experience. I have a huge issue with Facebook using fact checkers to try to silence medical doctors, scientists, virologists and epidemiologists voices as well as the general publics first hand experience in regards to covid-19 and the vaccine. The nazis did the same to the Jews and look how that turned out"
Qassem Soleimani. Qassem Soleimani is our national identity ... Instagram deletes posts related to Qassem Soleimani by violating privacy and freedom of expression     ...                  
Psycho. Psychotic lengths to collect peoples data and forever making updates nobody even asked for
New Update is HORRIBLE. I DO NOT LIKE THE SUGGESTED POSTS THAT APPEAR ON MY PERSONAL NEWSFEED IF I WANTED TO SEE THOSE PAGES POST I WOULD FOLLOW THEM I ONLY WANT TO SEE THE POSTS  PICTURES OF THE PEOPLE I FOLLOW FIX ASAP PLEASE
Some people can use functions others can. Have an Apple phone 10xr Cant use the music function the software and app have both been updated. The app is just going downhill I wanted to separate my business and personal life so I created a personal page. So get this the music function works on that page but it wont let me follow anyone The Worst
"So easy to get hacked. There are so many hackers on Instagram and both my actual account and hairdressing account have been taken and no one has helped with trying to get it back, never mind the fact that theres no number you can call to get help either. The account has changed all my personal information as well and when I tried to fix everything from the emails Instagram were sending me it did absolutely nothing. Im ashamed that this has happened and I wont be creating another account. Myself and others have also reported the hackers account and both my accounts to get all of them taken down but nothings working and Instagram have done nothing"
Consistency. I have 2 accounts one is thememedealer68 The other is a personal I dont post a lot on my personalBut I have got reported on my meme account A couple of times and Ive got disabled BUT Im still waiting for you guys to review my info and why is my personal account blocked if hasnt violated any communication lines
"Doesnt reply to any emails from users that need help. My Instagram @cindydiaku got hacked and Ive sent in almost 50 if not more requests, the only reply Ive gotten was to tell me to take a picture of myself with a code they sent me and after that Ive still not gotten a reply Ive sent in so many things to prove my identity through my email and no one is helping. Whats the point of having forms to reach out for help if no one is even reading them"
"Poorly Maintained. A lot of the design is poor quality and messy, with the notifications icon constantly glitching, a poorly-located notifications tab, an inconvenient posting button location, and WORST OF ALL: how impossible it is to access the saved feed. Youre telling me that if I scroll through my saved, then go to Home to answer a DM, once I click my profile it will take me out of the saved feed and to my personal page?? And I have to re-open my saved and scroll all the way down to where I was? By far the worst part of the app"
"Bugs. Instagram says they took the music on stories feature off for business accounts due to copyright issues, then why cant I put music on my personal account? I dont even have a professional or business account, and I checked and it said switch to professional account, so why is this happening?"
Access to photos and camera removed suddenly. Access to photos and camera was removed suddenly and resetting privacy settings and access settings was not clear cut
I COULDNT LOG IN. I wanted to check in on my instagram and take a look at stories then BOOM My account was compromised I barely check out instagramand it says I've been sharing my private information
A problem. Its a good app but the problem I have is that when I unfollow a lot of people and delete a lot of post it keeps say action block its annoying today I made my anime account into my personal account its been more than a hour since I deleted and unfollowed a lot of people and it still says that I want to unfollow the rest of the people on the account and follow the people on my other one please fix that
Hacked. Help I some how got hacked by a random hacker on Instagram. I gave none of my Instagram info to anyone. They said the only way I could get it back is if I cash app them money. They are scamming people on my account Kiara.sealey
"The app is fine but. I cant stay on the app without it trying to do privacy checks on my account, what makes this worse is that when the tab of it comes up, nothing else shows up. I cant interact with it and theres no options"
dislike right now. i love this app but it messed up my spam and now i cant even look or post right now and i had no clue what i did and i updated the app and my phone but its still tripping and i literally cant reinstall it because i dont have anymore data and its scaring me because thats my safe place and now im completely mad and scared fix your stuff instagram
Action block. Hey my app isnt working I cant even access the app because all it does is pop up the Instagram logo at the top it doesnt let me even log in fix this please
"Share to Story option missing for 1.5 years. I dont have the option to share public posts to my story. This has been a problem for over a year and a half. Its only for 1 of my accounts, and its only a problem on iOS. Ive done everything. Update. Reinstalled. Reset my phone. Got a new phone. Tried on different devices. Its only my one account only on iOS regardless of device. The only time I see this option is if I share an IGTV video. Everything else does not provide the option for public, shareable posts. Even my own posts I cant share to my story. I switched from a personal account to business account to creative account and back again. Nothing helps. Ive reported this issue what must be 100s of times over the last year. I just wish I can talk to someone to help"
"WON'T LET ME CHANGE MY PROFILE. Hi Instagram, I&#39;ve been trying to change my profile picture for months but the app keeps saying that I have an unstable internet connection and to try again later. However, I&#39;ve tried connected to several different wifi&#39;s, cellular data, and even a friends hotspot and it still won&#39;t let me change it. Not only this, but sometimes the app blocks me because I&#39;ve been changing my pic too fast (even though instagram blocked me and I can&#39;t change it at all) This also happens when I try changing anything to my profile, including my bio, and username. It&#39;s ridiculous that I can&#39;t change anything or use some of the most important features of the app. Please help me and get this fixed Thanks"
"Doesnt let me change profile photo. I tried changing my profile photo but it keeps telling me there is an error with my internet connection. My internet connection is fine. I tried change my profile pic while connected to wifi, then i tried while on my data, but it still wont work. I also tried uninstalling and installing the app, i tried to log in and out but nothings working. I can change my pfp on my other account but not on my main one. I keep trying to contact instagram and i keep reporting the problem but they never respond and its getting really annoying"
"Give business accounts more music features. Love Insta, however, since I have a business account, I dont get the music options personal accounts get, which is frustrating. Please consider providing more current or a wider variety of music for business accounts"
"Disappointing considering how big they are. There should be a lot more addition, abilities, better overall quality. Simple stuff that lacks that could make an effective communication platform. Through privacy and user control initiatives"
"Edit Profile/Notifications. Im experiencing two major issues with my profile:1) Im unable to edit my profile picture. It constantly says I need to be connected to WiFi, even though I am.2) I do not get notifications for new followers, likes, or comments. I have updated my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app itself, and have still faced these issues for months I have reported the problem multiples times and have not received any support. Please advise"
So frustrating. Even with the constant data sucking updates I still cant upload from all of my photo albums.  I have to save photos twice to get them to upload to the app.  And I cant upload from my desktop.  I like and hate Instagram
The new update has bugs. Not able to repost anything on the new instagram update on my business account. My personal accounts work but my business account paper airplane does not allow the option to share to story - only as private messages. Very annoyed
"Hackers and Instagram is no help. I am very disappointed with instagrams help.  Someone hacked into my account @selenawjohnson and changed my email, phone number, and password. They also changed my account to @selenawwjohnson and set up two set authentication with their information on their phone. I have no way of getting back into my account. Now they are pretending to be me and asking all my followers for money. Theyre scamming people and pretending to be me Ive tried to use instagrams selfie recognition but while it recognizes its me, does nothing due to the two step authentication that the hacker has What do I do?"
What the Algorithm?. I literally spent 10 minutes scrolling through my feed and saw MAYBE 5 of my personal friends post... ugh
Almost Perfect. everything almost always just runs super smooth for me on this end other than the fact that my instagram wont update and have to features that others do. for example i cant repost other posts to my story. on my business instagram i cant but only personal i can so i dont understand. its still not working and nothing will change
hacking. people are either hacking my account or my friends accounts STOPPPPP like my account is supposed to be secure BUT ITS NOT so get off ur butt and let me back into MY ACCOUNT im going too sue if you keep letting private information OUT YOU DONK
"Bad staff. I reported an issue where I cant see anything in any tags, and Im imagining my posts arent showing up in the tags either. I cant even check. I contacted staff about this issue and just never heard back. I use Instagram to promote my art, I need access to the tabs. My personal account doesnt have this problem. The staff shouldnt be ignoring the problem/my message"
Instagram story music. Okay so I have two instagrams. One is personal account and one is a business account. On my personal account I have the option to put music onto my Instagram story as the sticker is there. However for my business account I dont have that option and I really need it as when I post stories I like for there to be music. Why is this happening that it works on one but not the other?
"i cant edit my profile. Instagram keeps getting worse and worse each update and it got so many error and bugs. I have a fan account and I tried changing my profile picture several times but it just doesnt work then my friend told me to use the browser and it worked but going to my browser everytime I just wanna change my pfp is too much isnt it? Then I put a link of my yt channel on my bio and I badly wanna remove it but oh well how can I? Its Instagram. A fully red notification comes from the bottom everytime I try to remove the link or change my pfp and I cant even remove the link from the browser and at one point I thought it was my phone but no it wasnt cuz I tried it in my other phone and its the same, please Instagram fix this or Im deleting this app since its slowly turning into garbage day by day"
good app but. i feel violated because i saved a picture from the app that had a filter. when i posted the picture as a regular one it showed a link the the creator of the filter. i get wanting to give credit but it already does that on the story. its really creepy that its keeping track of my gallery like that. ??????
"Its getting worse. I tick so many post as not interested on my feed every time and they are persist yet After watching a post related to a particular topic, all my posts on feed turn to that topicIts so annoying.The download data is not complete and doesnt show all the posts ive watched in a particular date, its more like a summery There is reply option for dm on Android but not for IOS and some other options too. Please release a good update"
Customer service. Been trying to get ahold of someone from Instagram to see if they can take down a page that got hacked and I havent heard from them These people hacked my personal account and now are asking my followers for money They are trying to scam with my account and I need it deleted. Please help
Constantly not working. Everyday itll say something went wrong please try again later like this is unreal. We figured out how to fly to the moon but yet cant seem to run social media properly. My data &amp; wifi are perfectly fine
"The addiction is horrible. Ive taken to deleting the app constantly , and you should too . My mental health / physical health really suffers from the nonsense features meant to destroy our individuality . I hate it . I have hired social media workers because its horrible to be addicted to it . And its ( obviously ) designed to addict us . As an addict in recovery , I say no . And what is reels ? Dumbest feature ever . Dont make your spying on me sooooo obvious"
"They are listening to your conversations. I spoke about someone so specific it couldnt have been more detailed, private , or random, then a few hours go by and I get a notification to follow that person. I am extremely skeptical. I will not be continuing for much longer on this app"
Help. I reported my account being hacked. Several other people have reported that my account has been hacked. They posted a video somehow of me talking about bitcoins and mining. Now theyre putting my banking information out there for everyone to see. How do I get rid of this immediately?
Annoying bug. Since I downloaded the update I can no longer view when my friends are active/online. Ive deleted and downloaded the app many times restarted my phone. Always seems to happen right after I agree to allow IG to track other apps it happens when I reject or accept the app to track. It activity status also stops working when I allow IG access to my photos and allow access to mix settings. Nothing seems to work for me
"Nothing Loads. For about 2 weeks now, half the posts on my feed do not load at all, no matter if I use my data or my wifi. Half of other peoples stories dont load as well. Is there a way to fix this or is this an instagram issue?? Whatever it is, its getting pretty annoying because I cant view peoples posts"
Hate the new suggestions. Seriously dont need new suggested pages taking over my feed. There is already an explore option for the app. And that is where I explore new pages. I do not need it on my personal feed
"Rxo.rhy. Instagram wont let me post Instagram posts bc my connections bad when its on full bars I tried mobile data and other wifi from my neighbours and the same thing is happening. Please help with this also when I post it says well try again when theres better connections, I deleted the app and reinstalled it still didnt work and I even switched my phone off and turned it back on and STILL didnt work"
Features arent the same. My features on my personal account are different than the features on my professional account????Also I cant make reels because Instagram next button is in front of the bar
Ive been having problems. Ive been having a lot of problems it will no longer let me post let me post on my story or let me call or text it saying that there is a problem with my data but Ive been having the same data for the last two years and nothing is been wrong so what is going wrong because it started going wrong when the new update came out
Profile picture. Im just curious as to why I cant change my profile picture it says no internet connection but Im connected to WiFi and have my mobile data on so I need help with that
i cant post several photos. yall took away posting several photos feature and i feel like deleting it now because i just dont see the point. every post is followed with another picture for me and yall just take it away. and removing posts about freeing palestine????  its not terrorism its spreading information
"New Update is HORRIBLE. After the latest update I can not log into my Instagram via the app due to an error message. Ive done everything including resetting my pw, restarting my phone, uninstalled and reinstalling the app, deleting and redownloading the app, resetting my network settings, resetting my phone - and still no luck. Im able to login via the web and my work phone. But I want to use the app on my personal phone. Ive tried reposting the issue to ig and havent heard back. So needless to say Im frustrated and disappointed with the lack of help available"
"bugs. it didnt let me click on instagram notifications, and it wouldnt let me respond to others. i deleted the app and tried to download again but it just said loading and i cant even get the app anymore"
"No Tech Support. Ive worked really hard to build up a following on IG and genuinely enjoy the app. However, I still dont have the ability to see my follower categories (least interacted with, most shown in feed) on my main IG account. This feature has been rolled out across the board for months now. Ive uninstalled the app completely. I tried switching from creator to personal to business. Nothing works. There is zero tech or customer support and reporting the bugs doesnt work or ever get a response. Its frustrating and dangerous to think if I had a bigger issue on IG I wouldnt be able to get a hold of any sort of support"
Were Getting Hacked. Hi Someone On Instagram hacked My Account and Trying To Send Spams And Website links To Other People And Hacking there account can you please Have This better Improved Thank you :)
Wht happened. My Instagram isnt working anymore it wont load and its been down for 3 days already ???? I tried everything I uninstalled it then installed it again . I cleared data Idk what else to do ???
5 Stars Absolutely Incredible. It is amazing all I wanted in a social media it is amazing because you can have so many accounts people may hate one of them but you can block them and they cant see your posts you can rps as well and make group chats and watch lives of your favourite celebrities or go live your self and you can post a story a reel and a video and just pictures it is honestly one of the best apps Ive had in my whole life I love this app I really recommend it if you like social stuff or just on general:D
Sharing to Story. Im on instagram every single day. And I have sent in multiple requests to Instagram to fix a bug on mine that does not allow me the option to share posts to my personal story. Weeks later I still have not received ANY feedback from Instagram. I cant tell you how many different things I have tried to get the option to work on my Instagram. This is annoying. FIX THIS PLEASE
Music selection. Why is the music selection for stories limited and harder to navigate on a business account than a personal account? Thats ridiculous
"great app, few issues. Truthfully speaking, this is a great app, but since nothing is flawless, this app is no exception. Initially, the fact that you are only able to tag 20 people in a post is very frustrating because what if there are 20+ people in a post? It would be great if this switched to 20 tags per PICTURE so that if we post two pictures in a post we are able to tag more people on the second slide. The second issue is personal. Back in April my friend wanted to send me a post but she could not find my username and we came to find out that my account had been glitching. When she clicked on our chats  said that she was talking to herself. Some people contacted me from another account asking me why i had blocked them, although they were not. One account that i used to follow says user not found every time I click on their profile, even l none of us have blocked one another. It would also mean a lot if we were able to see who viewed our video since we arent able to know that either. I believe it is also a necessary option to be able to hide certain posts/stories from certain. For example, there are three stories and one doesnt want certain people to see the third story but if they hide them from their story, the cannot view the other two as well. Same goes for posts. Hope at least one of these ideas succeed.- H"
"Cant upload videos. Ive been trying for days to post a few pictures and videos from a recent trip and they will not upload whatsoever. Ive tried different wifi settings, using my data, nothing. Whats the point of having a platform to share images and video if they wont even work?"
"Music on Stories. What will it take to get the music option for the stories? Have a personal profile and two business ones, one of the business ones doesnt have that option. Ive sent reports and never get an answer. Whats going on?"
Worst update. I have never shopped on Instagram before. Its newest update has now taken away the more personal features that each user gets. I feel like its shoving the shopping feature down my throat. I dont use social media to shop I use it to stay in touch with family in friends... now its taking that away from me? No thanks
The most annoying update ever. Instagram was good until this update when if you had a business account you couldnt have access to ANY music only background music that nobodys even heard of. its understandable for a business account because yea okay there might be an issue with copy right but the fact that after switching to a personal and re-installing multiple times its still not working?? its getting old. please fix this before instagram users find a better more reliable app
"Login activity privacy issue. I wake up in the morning to see this app updating and after the app is done updating. I see all of my previous accounts that I logged into on front of my login page. One account in particular it didnt belong to me and I tried avoiding that account. When seeing the login activity on that account setting it still had all of my location and my iPhone present on that accounts login activity history. I tried logging out in order to delete the login activity history now theres five login activity info. It logs me out of that account every time I try to delete the history. It says that my device is active on that account. Please, fix this annoying problem"
"i got banned for making an account. so first off this stupid app forces you to make an account just to scroll, second i still cant use it because the moment i created an account i got banned for suspicious activity. do you know how little that narrows it down? then when i try to appeal i have to show my face, which, for privacy reasons, i dont want to show. and no they havent gotten back to me. would not recommend"
This is bs. So I keep getting hacked somehow and so does my friend if I were u dont say anything to anyone well dont text anyone cuz whoever it is gets ur info and tells other people and also lies to ur friends
"Dont update. As soon as I ran my last update, Instagram wants to data mine my birthday. So, a fake date it is"
"Smh this ends now. I got hacked and I feel we need more procedures to end this account hacking there should be some ways to get  a lost and or hacked account back looking at majority,first and usual log ins and text message history and location and also phone device used these things should be ran thru the second a report is being made and return the account to its previous owner and the person hacking should be banned and the device used to hack an account should be banned from making any more accounts"
"Lost photos. Has to be the worst customer service team out of any social media platform or anything. Deactivated my account and when I reactivated it, all of my photos were gone. No one will respond as to why this is or with a solution to fix it. Everything else on my profile is the same except it says no postswhen I download my data all of my posts are in the content folder so clearly they exist but wont load to my page. Again no one seems to have an answer or even get back to me. 0 stars if possible"
My Instagram was hacked. My Instagram was hacked and deleted and I would just like to get it back. Like I know if the police can track down a old Instagram then so can Instagram
Pfp. Its not seeming to let me change my profile picture I shouldnt need a internet connection when I have Data please fix
Accounts get disabled for no reason. The AI is bonkers. Small personal account with low sub count and instagram just deactivated it
This app is crap. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING? TAKING LGTBQ+ PEOPLES INFO AND SENDING THEM VIDEOS OF LGTBQ PEOPLE BEING RAPED MURDERED AND MORE? I AM SO CLOSE TO CALLING THE COPS ON YALL AT THIS FREAKING POINT SO MAYBE BACK OFF OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL SPAM YO EMAILS BRATS. LET LGTBQ PEOPLE BE
Wish we could hide posts as well as stories. Social media is getting better at navigating complicated personal relationships but it would be nice if we could hide posts as well as stories so those losers you are obligated to connect to arent watching your every move
Business account. Its quite difficult to separate the personal and business account. Cannot access business account profile easily or see what is being posted as business abs not personal. Would be good to be able to have them completely separate. Also it is not clear if you have connected your business account to your business Facebook page. Very frustrating and time consuming
Angry. Ive been trying to get back into my account for over a month due to my account being hacked. I keep doing video selfie after video selfie to no avail My video selfie keeps being denied talking about they cant verify its me Look at my profile picture its of me & my daughter Why cant i get some help???
"Mention in Bio Isnt Working. I own a business and of course have the mention in my bio for my personal account but out if nowhere its now greyed out and wont work. No resources anywhere online to tell me how to solve. I deleted and re-downloaded app, ensured on my business account that mentions are enabled for followers and everything.... please help"
Good app but needs fixing. I like your app the way you can interact with other people and post things you love or enjoy. But even when I use data it sometimes doesnt work and I get confused  please fix this problem and also can u add a no notification option?
Zero Consistency between accounts or anywhere. I have more than one Instagram account so I can separate personal stuff from hobbies etc. &amp; its infuriating that I get the ability to post reels on one but not on another - 2 of these accounts are under the same damn email addressAlso on every account the location of buttons is completely different. I get that not everyone has access to the same features at once - but surely accounts under the SAME email address should???Also.... Maybe before doing more updates you should make sure people have access to the latest update features As it seems some people get new features before others have access to ones that were released ages ago
"No notifications. For the past few months, I havent gotten notifications from instagram. The only way I get them is when when I have the app open. Im always late to conversations on group chat, and it makes me feel bad because sometimes my friends have importance conversations. Please fix this Its very annoying"
"my music doesnt work . so ive had a business account for a while now and ive never had a problem with finding the music i wanted. but recently instagram has taken away all my music that ive wanted to put on my stories. all thats on there now is bald men , russian music , and just some strange background music. i cant find artists like gorillaz , arctic monkeys , or any of the sort. i switched my account back to personal and it still wont give me my music back. whats happened ? im not sure but i really want my music back again. other than that im content with the app"
"No more multiple photos??. SRSLY- what happened and why?  I thought it was just me then I see the reviews for the latest update.BRING IT BACK OR IM OUT.  And yeah, Ill delete FB too.  Theres no logical reason for removing that feature for personal users- I see commercial accounts can still do it"
Reels option not working in my account. This is my personal instagram account My reels option not working in my accountso please fix it thanks
I dont understand HELP. Hi. Ive been on instagram for years and ive never encountered this problem. I was scrolling instagram like i usually do throughout the day. Spent hours on it trying to find specific items. Closed the app. Opened it again few minutes later and suddenly its as if its stuck. I cant refresh the feed. My profile etc wont even load. Nothings loading. Now i did think maybe its my data connection or wifi. But my other apps are working normally. No issues whatsoever. Its just the instagram app. Please explain and help
"no help for support. ive tried countless ways to contact instagram and theres no way. Every time i try to alter something in my profile it says the connection isnt working. So i tried using different phones, different wifis, my data, the website, and i reported it multiple times to instagram but nothing has helped my issue"
"Love the connection. Can talk with people well beyond my status Quo, stars/famous people can actually interact with fans on a personal level if they want.. I like that part.. makes people seem real"
"Hacked Account. My instagram got hacked, he swapped my email and phone number now I cant log back in because every time I try to re log in it just sends a recover code to the SCAMMERS email. Ive tried every thing from the help center and request support, but none of these features WORK on instagram. It just says Error: email with email. I had a thousand followers and I feel so embarrassed with the content they are posting and sending to everyone. If youre considering using this app be careful because all they need is your email or phone number because then they just use it to press forgot password and it signs you out. Its such a major loophole that instagram has"
"Cencorsed. For quite some time now I have not had the ability to add posts to my story, which sounds very silly but hear me out. I have multiple other Instagram accounts that hat have this feature, but on my main personal account there simply is no option. I have tried everything I possibly could on my end even having friends look into it because they didnt believe I didnt have this Its quite frustrating when I want to share information Im passionate about or simply to enter a f@$#ing contest. I have been emailing, reporting issues, tagging Instagram but no response has so ever"
owned by n@z darpa creepers. ig is owned by fb n@z darpa in-q-tel zionists stasi data collecting people farmers. all fake. all data brokers waiting to people farm you &amp; blackmail you
"Awful with Account Resolution. My account was hacked and taken over by someone in Nigers two months ago. IG did nothing to help even though I did everything they asked. I had to create a whole new page, lost all my followers, friends, and old photos. Definitely not useful when there are hacking issues but unfortunately some of my friends and family use IG. Thats the only reason I have it"
"Unknown. Dear Instagram, I just wanted to know why a permanently deleted account cAnT be brought back? Like I genuinely want to know(Im really curious). Does the account data get wiped from the whole system? If you answered then thank you:)"
"Hate new update. I cant see who Ive requested that havent accepted me back, the new access data isnt the best"
"please fix these issues before your consumers shut down their accounts althogether. hi, with the latest update 3 times in the past month i have had my account locked because i apparently shared my password with a website to gain likes and followersi have not shared any personal information about my account.this issue should be easy to fix and has continued to be a hindrance. i now no longer can access my account at all, and i have no date of when it will be fixed. not only that but your algorithm is absolutely terrible. it has been so, so harmful to content creators, and has brought down the postivity and enjoyment for artists and content creators as a whole. please fix this, thousands of users are already planning to move to new social platforms with a better set up because of this issue"
"Please let me be able to get some help. I used to love Instagram. Then I was hacked. I tried every available option on Instagram to save my account. Absolutely no help. I have no access to my old account, no idea who is now using it, and no way of getting it back. All I wanted was some help. I was blocked at every turn because I didnt have the complete information and it wouldnt let me submit to receive further help. Please- can I just get some way to get in touch with a human???? If I could give you zero stars right now I would. Thanks for nothing. We give you access and trust, you give nothing"
Notifications issue. I cant get my Instagram notifications on my phone. Everything else is working except Instagram. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it &amp; log out and log in to my account but still nothing. I only get the notifications when i open the app. All my phone notifications settings are working. PLEASE HELP. I already reported an issue to Instagram but still nothing
"App issues. So i never write these but Instagram is a great app but ive been having an issue for awhile now, so whenever i try to open my messages it spams me with a pop up saying something went wrong and it keeps doing that to the point i cant go on my Instagram. And ivd already reported the problem, ive restarted my phone, ive deleted Instagram then re downloaded. Nothing is working which means its an app issue. Please fix it"
"Unbelievable. This app has turned my life around  It is so wonderful to have  Many good uses . Incredible boredombreaker  Use : contact friends , post videos and photos , scroll through Hollywood stars , contact celebs , tag people , follow people , and call / FaceTime By Jessmartin8505 "
"Its been over 5 years and it still hasnt been fixed. Dont get me wrong, I love the app. But when it comes to editing my profile page, its a disaster. I should be able to change my profile picture anytime I want. When I want to change it, I have to connect to WiFi. I dont always have access to WiFi and have to rely on using my phone data"
2020 update is disappointing & commercial. With the new 2020 update theres two big visible changes.1. A dedicated reels page to exclusively what short video content 2. A shopping page I can only say this is disappointing as if I wanted a short form video app Id download obvious apps and there must be more people like me that prefer the photo exploring and dont watch videos on their phone. Secondly you always knew how Instagram uses your data but this update is commercially obtuse.I cant help but feel like this update was narrowly thought through for a particularly small age group of user
"Account was Deactivated right after Creation. Not even a minute after I made my account (with an email that&#39;s never been associated with an Instagram account before) it was deactivated. I wasn&#39;t even able to make my profile. I had to send a photo of my face with a code and my account info to prove I own it, and now I haven&#39;t even gotten a response. Nothing was inappropriate, I wasn&#39;t even able to get past the sign-in screen let alone pick a profile picture. I&#39;m still waiting on an answer or a solution. Thanks Instagram Team. "
Missing features. What happened to the story features? I have 3 different accounts and my personal account is missing 3 features that my other two accounts have. Ive sent instagram 3 reports and nothing
No one cares. Seriously no one cares about your fact checkers or v@c info. Just be a place we can post pictures
"Sharing Posts To Story. I believe people have constantly asked for this, but as some may know a lot of Instagram users dont have the Share post to story option. I have two accounts, one personal and one for public view. On my personal I can share posts. On my public I cant share posts. I can only share IGTV stuff which in my opinion is not fair sense I dont use IGTV. Is Instagram currently fixing the problem? Are you able to give all accounts their access to reshare posts on their stories? I know this probably wont be read but it was worth a shot. Overall I think Instagram is a good app to use. Just hope that this option works for everyone"
Somethings Wrong. Im trying to post onto my account (I have a reposting page) and I do give credit to everyone that I get pictures from but I think that Instagram thinks I am stealing photos. What should I do???
Cannot reshare stories. All of the sudden Instagram removed my ability to share a story from my own personal business account? No self promotion allowed? Please give that little paper plane baaaaack
The worst. The worst app in privacy
"Hacked with no help. Instagram help is non-existent. My account was hacked and because they then changed my email, phone number and password. There is no way to get the account back. Shame on you Instagram"
No costumer support. My instagram has been glitched for months. I cannot share my own post to my story or anyone else&#39;s posts regardless of their privacy settings. Instagram has no email or online forum to submit my problem. They only accept general feedback which they do  not respond. This is an ongoing problem for months and there is no one to help fix it
I NEED AN UPDATE. when i click on following on my account it says cant load data and ive tried restarting my phone and deleting and redownloading the app many times
"hacked . i love this app but i feel it needs too be more safety so people cant get into personal information i just got hacked or my acc took yesterday, it had all personal things on there and i was nervous  but yeah i feel it needs to be more protective"
September 2021 update - fail. I have used Instagram to sort and save information and ideas. They have changed saved and I can no longer see more than 18 posts in any of my categories. This is frustrating and I havent found any information on how to retrieve them. Bad update and poor customer service
Spy. Arent talking spying on us Ok bye
Repeatedly actionblocked. I have a vent account that I use ONLY for very close personal friends but every few weeks I get hit with an action block because Using bots to gain followers and likes goes against our guidelines why would I use a follower bot when I only allow very close personal friends to follow me??? Its idiotic and Insta needs to get their bot detection straight
"FIX NOTIFICATIONS. About a week ago, I un-downloaded and re-downloaded Instagram. Before I un-downloaded it, I was receiving my DM notifications just fine, since theyre the only notifications I had on. Whenever I downloaded the app again, I did make sure to allow Instagram to let my phone receive notifications and stuff, however I wasnt receiving any. They werent showing up at all unless I was in the app. Ive updated, undownloaded, reinstalled, powered off my phone, and checked multiple times to make sure I had notifications on. Nothing is working. Im not sure if its a bug with my phone or with Instagram itself but I rely on Instagram DMs to communicate with a lot of people. Im not the only one having these types of problems"
"Cant access my account. Whenever I try to access my account it says The username you entered doesnt appear to belong to an account, Please check your username and try again. I&#39;ve tried to log in through the website and all it says is There was a problem logging you into Instagram. Please try again soon. I have restarted my phone and deleted Instagram in hopes that it would fix it, I have also tried to go to help center and it wont let me do anything to fix it, Yet I have logged into my account on a different device and it lets me"
Broken. Why does it say I need to view my billing information in order to download the app
"Simple To Use. Very simple to use, great resource for personal promotion, and a great platform for getting your name out there.Never get too caught up with your follower count. Always stay in the game and just know you will reach greatness. Dont give up because you will make it in time"
"explore page. i tried updating instagram for the new stories update, but when the feature wasnt working i decided to delete and reinstall the app. however, when i logged back in to my account i found the update was still not working and the explore page didnt have any posts that were relevant to me. its like when you first get instagram and the app just recommends random pictures of landscape, food, etc. it saved all my data and liked posts so i dont know why it wont recommend me posts based on what im interested in. i have to manually look up posts to like and even then the explore page wont change"
"I loved IG but lately not so much. Instagram was my favorite social for so long. I loved that it was mainly just pictures & all around a more positive platformbut lately I cant even log in. My account is still up, hasnt been hacked, it literally just says error when I try to log in.I have tried all things deleting the app, restarting my phone, tried to reset my password but it wont even let me.Even before this happened, things took ages to load on Instagram. Sometimes they wouldnt load at all. Overall a great app just needs a little work"
"Getting intermittent pop ups about limited account. The issue started on my personal account but now its on every account using the app on my iPhone. It also use to only do it on 1-2 days a week, now its been days of constant pop up messages about Instagram limiting certain activities. Ive reported it numerous times and nothing fixes it. I delete the app, reinstalled, changed my profile... nothing seems to work and IG IT seem more preoccupied with rolling out the next useless update that will continue to make the app worse"
bad app. bad app. horrible app. bad for your mental health. waste of time. horrible app to encourage young people to get as our minds are still malleable and comparing our own lives to others can really damage mental health and self esteem. reels is stupid. and now yt has their version of reels too. why cant tiktok just stay on tiktok. i have tiktok uninstalled for a reason. because i dont want it lol before i deleted instagram i had an incredible urge to post every single thing i did in my life. every single thought that went through my head went on my private story. it was so stupid. i have wasted so many hours on this stupid app that has no benefit whatsoever when i could have been spending my time working on my mental health instead of worsening it. i could have been doing something that actually brings me joy like painting or playing video games but NOOOO im gonna scroll on instagram for four hours instead. i hate instagram
"Some users share or post false information. Armenian users block or report  who posting true things about TRUE history and then they share or post about false information:FALSE HİSTORY,Faıse information.They kill Azerbaijanians and they say azerbaijanians do it to Armenians "
Instagram issues with the new update. It wont let me tag people anymore since the new update and my messages wont send when Im on a video chat to someone. I am very disappointed with the new update. In my personal opinion Instagram needs to do another up date where u can text and call people at the same time.I also cant tag people in my post. Me and a few of my friends are having the same problem
Invasion of Privacy. Im moving to Parlor where there is free speech and no censorship of opinions no matter how ridiculous they may be
"Please help with my Instagram problem. I keep getting put on a 10 day restriction/blocked repeatedly for using a company to get more likes and followers but this is not true. I am not doing this and the block is happening over and over. Ive changed my password so many times my head is spinning. Ive reinstalled the app several times, as well. Ive sent email after email to Instagram asking to have this error fixed but no response and it keeps on happening. There must be a glitch on 2 of my accounts because this is happening all the time on both accounts. I will like a few pictures and then Im blocked immediately. I also like them very slow because Ive been on restriction for going too fast before, so I know the rules and Im careful about that.      Could I have been hacked by a company that sells likes and followers? My other account is thats having the same trouble is: @bonecrusher.harambe.anubis Please fix this problem on both of these accounts ASAP. Im begging you. Thank you so much,Kimberly Kanago @bettycupcakesthesluttypug@ bonecrusher.harambe.anubis"
My only hope. Im putting this app as a one star as a last resort to get some help. Instagram has not replied to my multiple complaints regarding my push notifications. I dont get any when I leave the app and Ive tried every option in the book. It has been hurting my growing business as well as my personal accounts. Please respond back to me ASAP. Thank you
"shopping button replaces likes? terrible update. hey zuck, you moved the notifications to the top where you KNOW its hard to reach. we know you did it on purpose because youre a capitalist  who wants us to all SHOP on your social media app. you tell the government you want to protect your users experience from them when youre the one stealing our data and making the app worst to use. your update is straight "
"Locked up app. Worthless. I have a personal account and a group account. The group account cannot be reached by the email they set up, so instagram thinks its a good idea to lock up my entire Instagram and will not let me go to my private account. It will not let me change the email either because its already linked to my personal account. Useless app for now. Uninstalling"
Bias. Very bias to Israel. Doesnt allow people to share their personal opinions
Music feature only works on my personal but not business profile.  please fix this Ive updated and everything and it wont work
Am i the only one. Am i the only one whos struggling with Instagram rn??? My messages wont send and my feed doesnt reload. My wifi is completely fine and I even tried w my data. Still no hope
"Cant get into Instagram. For the last 2 days, I havent been able to get into Instagram while out, but I am able to get into it when Im connected to WiFi. Every time I turn on my data to use Instagram, I always get a message saying, no internet connection. This is really pi**ing me off because I think Ive possibly lost my account trying to work out something. I should give Instagram a 0 star, but unfortunately I cant"
"My Account Was Discarded. I started a business account last January for Zumba that later turned into my personal account. About 3 months ago, Instagram asked for my contact information and then I wasnt able to access my account. When trying to log in a banner popped up that said, thank you for providing your information. We will review it and get back to you in 24 hours. Its been 3 months and Im pretty sure Instagram completely got rid of my account because its no where to be found. I was just a regular user that did not violate any Instagram rules. I also wasnt able to reach customer service at Insta. If any employee of the app read my review, can you help me get my account back?"
"Get rid of reels. Id like to pick the content I want to see, not be force fed talentless morons on your new Ticktok imitation. No matter how many I block or click not interested Instagram seems adamant to fill my feed up with spam I couldnt care less about. The algorithm has been broken for a long time and it is getting steady worse. I need it for work or else I would have got rid long ago"
"TERRIBLE. Hi I just wanted to let you know, before you get instagram you WILL get hacked I had my account for a couple days and it got hacked. They said I was using an app to get followers or likes which is a lie. So, my account got compromised. I forgot my password so I clicked forgot password. I put in my phone number and got a link that just led me back to the same page  I deleted the app and reinstalled it, thinking I would have to sign up again, but it led me back to the same page, AGAINN Please do not waste your time in this endless loophole"
CENSHORSHIP. Real life HUMAN BEINGS are being TORTURED and KILLED in 2021 and we stand by and refuse to do or EVEN SAY something about it as an international community.  They are censoring posts on Palestine and they are shutting down Palestinian live streams during IDF attacks.  This a form of a blackout and they are refusing to let up. I understand this is a private company with private rules but if Israeli news can get through fine then so should Palestinian news. They are doing this so YOU gain a Biased viewpoint on a sensitive situation ahhh theres no point this will get deleted too. And before you say something Im not even a Palestinian Im a human being that sees right from wrong
5XX Error?. I dont know whats going on but I was kicked out of my Instagram and my WhatsApp and it kept saying internet problem but my internet is fine. I even tried my mobile data. Nothing is working I need answers
"They dont respond. Trying to figure out what happened to my account, I send an email though the help center help and I get email and send what needs to be sent and no response. All the data I found to help me in the horrible help center was online"
"Lame. Was good until this country went to trash and affected the app limiting my own spam account from using words that im using on a PRIVATE account, if you guys know what PRIVATE means, if someone has a problem then let them remove themselves as a follower i have people who enjoy things i post and this squishy soft app cant take a few words... TRASH"
Deactivation. App violates your privacy by allowing you to deactivate your account
Deleted for no reason. My account was deleted randomly and without warning. Instagram will not let me appeal this decision because supposedly I did not follow the community guidelines. My account was completely personal and I did not post anything offensive. Very unhappy that Instagram wont even let me file an appeal to have my account reactivated. I used it frequently to communicate with friends and family
"Bad company. Awful never respond to emails theyre useless, Ive been logged out for months and cant get access to my pictures any other way"
"Account deactivated for no reason. Hello random stranger reading the reviews, if you dont mind your account being deleted and deactivated for absolutely no reason, Instagram is the app for you Today I was scrolling though my feed and after clicking on the profile picture of an advertisement I saw, I was quickly prompted to log out. Instagram then showed a warning message on screen we will review your account in 24 hours to see if we should deactivate your account now this could be hacking from a third party member but still, Instagram isnt taking any steps to prevent things like this from happening. I know IG has a bad history of deactivating and deleting innocent accounts... on top of that, their customer service is horrible. No one responds to the support emails and no one, absolutely not a soul, answers the phone calls. I would very much appreciate it if I can have my account back because it dates back to my middle school memories"
"Cant login. Honestly I love talking to my friends but Instagram makes it difficult because people have made fake accounts of me and they wont get deleted but I almost did for telling them to stop,and now I have to deal with not logging in after having a error with it loading on WiFi and data and I cant even open it on a browser,they need to update it and fix asap"
"Problem. Although despite this app being awesome and fun, I have had an issue for around seven months. Why does it say I have one post when I dont have any?? I have reported for help many times, close to 5 months but still hasnt been fixed. Ive even reset my whole phone, reported to Instagram, delete the cache and erase all data. I know many people who have had the same issue and could do nothing"
"Poison. Literally a desperate attempt to show us as many ads as possible so that Zuckerberg can steal our data and make money off us, an app which is incredibly addictive and necessary  for staying in touch with people. Super toxic, stay off while you still can"
"Cant post stories with music. Okay. So Ive had a business page, and a personal page for quite some time now and I cannot upload any stories with music on my business account I cant even repost videos Im tagged in, if the person added music to it. I can add, repost anything as long as it doesnt have music added. Which makes absolutely no sense Both accounts are from the same region, are both updated, but I was never able to get the add music sticker on my business page. But on my personal page I can add music and repost anything with music"
"Missing features. While its a great app and one I use all the time, but for some reason there are features missing form my account. I have 2 accounts, one personal and one professional. My personal one doesnt have the new favorite accounts timeline feature and the activity bubbles on top of texts barely work, only showing accounts I rarely talk to. My professional one has the favorite timeline featured but not the activity bubbles but Im guessing thats why it doesnt show up. Point is that I have the latest version of instagram and IOS. It is as well slow at certain times despite my Wifi being good and instagram being the only app Im using. Im not sure if im the only account, I doubt it, but it would be great if these problems could be fixed"
Like the app just annoyed. I love Instagram and use it in all my devices However I became PR for an organization and I signed in on my phone and no matter what I do now it wont log me out. Ive reinstalled the app I log out and it takes me to my personal account but the other page is still there. Idk what to do but I want that page gone. 
love. i love this app but it messed up my spam and now i cant even look or post right now and i had no clue what i did and i updated the app and my phone but its still tripping and i literally cant reinstall it because i dont have anymore data and its scaring me because thats my safe place and now im completely mad and scared fix your stuff instagram

REELS ISSUE. I have 3 ig accounts. My business account lets me post reels and view reels. Where as my 2 personal accounts dont allow me to post reels or see them. It doesnt even have the option of reels
IG Help. Hi Instagram  My account was hacked and Ive walked through steps every day for the last 3 weeks to gain access.  Whoever hacked the account changed the email access and phone number so all security codes are being sent to an email that I have no access to.  Ive changed the email through your steps for hacked accounts and youve let me change my password but to prove identity Instagram sends codes to the hacked email account.  Ive been sending daily emails to update you with no response  Please help and thank you in advance
Help required please. My name is Norm Nicolet I have a private account.I am a junior high teacher.I believe a student has started this accountnorm_nicolet_ 1954Whoever started this account with my family picture they screened shot from Facebook.They are following 63 pornstars and my superintendent of education.I have parents phoning my principal saying that I have an account following 63 pornstars.Then I teach grade 7 girls.It makes me look like a creep.Instagram has been contacted account has been reported 100 times.Account is still public????Please help and stop this accountwhich is norm_nicolet_1954It is defamation of my character as a teacher.Please help with this
"It compromised my account. I honestly havent had any problems with Instagram until this past week where it compromised my personal account out of nowhere. Whenever I tried to get on it, it would say that my account has been compromised and that I had given my password and used a service to gain followers when in fact I havent done any of that. It had been working perfectly fine the night before. Apparently the password I remember putting on last is always the wrong one and whenever I try to press the forgot password button all it does it send me a link to get back on the same screen. This problem needs to be fixed because Ive seen that there has been others who have had this problem and cant get their accounts back"
Account hacked. Instagram please help my account got hacked @GodBlessMyDream is the name  The carried currently under it is fraud i have all the information to prove the person hacked me
very annoyed. i can no longer share posts to my story and especially when its important to share information right now this is ruining the app for me
New update. This new update which has moved the buttons to post a new photo and to see your notification to the top right of the screen is horrible. It slows down the whole app because if I want to see any new likes/comments/follows I have to go on the homepage and THEN click the notification button. This is completely unnecessary and makes for an incredible unpleasant experience.Reels and shopping are NOT being used widely enough to be placed at the bottom of the screen where the notification and posting buttons used to be.This is ridiculous and another example of Instagram trying to push new services on us.STOP IT
Instagram going three steps back. Instagram changing their homepage buttons for a shopping button when the whole app premise is for pictures is quite tone deaf especially since there is a global pandemic going on and people have lost their jobs. Are you an app for pictures or for selling stuff??? Utterly ridiculous
Pictures. Someone just hacked my account.. some old man..he has all of my personal photos and he posted naked pictures on itPlease help
Fix your issues man. My friend has data but their messages never send and you should fix that issues
"Deleted due to increased spam accounts and poor service. This app used to be a great social media device. Within the past 6 months I have never seen such an increase in spam accounts trying to follow me and DM me on any other app, and I have been using Instagram since 2013. It has gotten to the point that I could no longer take having the app on my phone. The fake accounts being made need to be put to a stop. Not only are they scam accounts, but some of them are highly suggestive towards young women who are in need of financial assistance. I had to put my account on private, and I reported every account I came across for spam, fraud, and sexual suggestiveness. Most of my report updates came back claiming they couldnt find the means to delete the accounts. It is very sad that clear and obvious spam accounts can continue to bother people and make them uncomfortable using the app"
FIX THE UPDATE. I login to my Instagram and it just looks different. Its like I see the same pictures over and over again. Then when I go on people account that i follow it says that I dont follow them when I clearly do because it will a few people thats following them and my name will be underneath. This is really annoying because now I dont have access to all of the private accounts that I follow
"Action Blocked. Dear Instagram, I ran into a problem today since I was unfollowing people I didnt know and a notification appeared. The notification told me that Ive been action blocked. Little did I now once I got out of that notification that I wont be able to like, DM, follow, unfollow, post, and edit posts. Ive never experienced this before as Ive used Instagram for many many years. Its unfortunate because now I cant do certain things like posting a picture or selfie I took on my iPhone. I think it would be a lot better if you give instagram users a warning before making them action blocked. Not every account is a spam account which follows people, therefore you should really think about this solution. This solution will help prevent real people using your Application (@Instagram) from becoming action blocked. Instagram is a 5 star app and thats the rate I would of given you guys, but once this occurred it changed my mind. Please fix this issue and I will give you back the original 5 stars I had given to you guys on your reviews. This would mean a lot to me and possibly to whoever who may have ran into this problem. Keep up the amazing work Instagram"
Update needed. Ill give it 5 stars once they update and get rid of this bug that makes instagram think ur not connected couldnt load post while ur data &amp; wifi connections are full strength but yet it constantly pops up couldnt load post or something went wrong try again later it just keeps on popping up non stop like seriously? besides that Instagram is great
Hacked. My account was hacked & I keep doing the video selfies but I keep being told my identity cant be verified. Would I keep trying to get into MY account if I didnt own the account???? My profile picture is of my daughter & myself. Isnt that enough??? I need help Ive been outta my account for almost 1 month. Help me please & TY
"Good. This app is my second most used app. I use it frequently and I have little issues with it. One of my biggest problems with this app is the uploading someone elses post to my story. Ive gone to the paper air plane on the bottom left and there isnt an option to put it on your story, so I proceed to go to my settings to enable the putting posts on story setting. But when I go to privacy then to story and scroll down to the bottom to find the setting just to find it simply doesnt exist in my settings. Ive looked for updates but there isnt any, Im clueless as to what I should do because I upload to my story quite frequently"
"Mark Zuckerberg wants your data. Online spaces shouldnt be demanding your birthday to use an already existing account. Thats internet safety 101, dont give your birthday out. Insta says no one will see it, but we know Zuck sure loves selling data lists for your full identity to be mapped out. Its not only invasive, but dangerous. Dont give them your real birthday"
No Help. Someone hacked my account and is pretending to be me and theres no way to contact Instagram or anything
See my Instagram. For about a month I have not been able to see my personal page every time I click on my page it goes black screen why?
"Too many ads. Period.Now you cant hide them easily either. All I can do is use the app less. Considering the shady invasion of privacy practices, perhaps not a bad thing. IMHO they are creating distain amongst users by force feeding ads"
FIX PROFILE PICTURES. I usually love instagram and everything surrounding it but the profile picture quality just gets worse and worse after every single update. Please fix this its awful and so ugly to the point where I dont even want to use this app anymore. It always gives the illusion of low quality photos and its hard to make out what the photo even is most of the time
"A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. All of a sudden I couldnt log into my account.  I go to the link that says forgot password and the keep saying they send a 6 digit auth code to my cell phone but I never receive one.  Then the customer service says they are emailing me a code and ok supposed to take a selfie with this code?? I have NEVER gotten any codes from you and they arent in my spam or junk folder.  The customer service is non existent and messaging with Instagrams help center is a joke.  I can get into my Facebook account just fine but Im locked out of my page and theres nothing I can do.  You guys have personal info of mine and pics of my personal life, family and children.  We all want to be part of the virtual social media world but they get all of your info and personal info and lock you out or hack you.  Its very frustrating and after my Cash app was hacked Im honestly thinking of dropping these accounts. Too much stress and Im violated and feel helpless. Dont use Instagram unless you put nothing personal on there and dont care if you never have access to again.  A total waste and disaster as three other people I know are having similar issues and there is NO solution to our account issues"
"@elesium review. Ive been an IGer for years and for the first five years it worked beautifully. All followers saw my posts on a timely matter. In the past few years sadly algorithms have ruined the program. Example , my 52,000 followers wont see my posts. A small handful that you decide are allowed to see my posts and they appear within minutes to 18 hours after I posted the image. I was hacked and I had zero help from IG. The hackers used my Email and threatened me for money to get my site back and I had no one to help me. I was told by a lawyer that even if the hackers find my house and kill me - IG is a third party and not libel. When I created my name , it was stolen 5 different times and when I asked for a star to show my hard work was the original @elesium. No one ever responded. Its a lovely site to share my knowledge of the arts and have posted over 2500 images many with biographies that can take several hours to research. Schools follow my site in the art departments for review. I have incredible followers from entertainment heavy hitters to mega singers. Add the premier artists of the 21st century .. I understand Im blessed to write my thoughts into my iPad and a handful read my words. The average account has 1% in likes and comments, and Im grateful to receive 3-4% in response. Thank you for reading"
Thank you. I love how easy it is to use. User friendly. I like that you can display your photography and keep your personal life out of it
"GLITCHING. For some reason my personal page cannot view my buisness page. It says that my buisness page has 0 followers and following and I cant follow thr account on my personal page. Im afraid that it may be doing this with other accounts. Also, when posting on my story, my music selections on my personal are different from my business. I dont know why we are not able to access the same music on both profiles. I asked for R&amp;b and it gave me its own version of that, with artist who are not even classified in this genre, yet on my personal, I can see all my favorites. This distinction is not useful: to decide what music is used on either accounts because of the assumed demographic. Not cool"
"Account hacked. My account was hacked a week ago, and FIVE of my selfie verification videos have been denied EVEN THOUGH there are pictures of myself on my Instagram. There is no support number or email to reach them, and reporting the account as impersonating me did nothing. They basically told me they didnt remove the account and due to high volume, they didnt review it. I had an art account linked to my main account and I cant even access it which makes me mad because I have to create new accounts for both now because I cant get any help recovering my original ones"
"Two major flaws. Lets just get right to it. My whole Instagram experience is being ruined by these flawsFlaw number 1the Im not interested button is 100% completely useless. It does nothing, when something pops up on my explore page that I dont want to see, DONT KEEP SHOWING ME STUFF LIKE THAT AFTER I CLICK NOT INTERESTED. Seriously whats the point in having that button if it does LITERALLY NOTHING.Flaw number 2Ive been on Instagram for 9 years but in the last few years, the amount of inappropriate Bot pages that comment on everything and view your stories is ridiculous. What makes it worse is that you cant report them, cause just like the not interested buttonthe report button does nothing. Apparently Instagram finds nothing wrong with spam/bot pages full of pictures of naked people touching themselves. Its literally in the profile pictures but yet Instagram does nothing. But they are quick to put Covid info on a post for just saying the word Covid. These inappropriate pages are in nearly every comment section you come across and they even will view your story so when you open your stories you can see a profile picture with a naked woman touching herself.  So yeah, this app has went down hill and did so very quickly"
"Promoted Posts. Ive been trying to contact support for a matter regarding a promoted post that refuses to delete for the last two weeks. There is no support for this matter and it is stopping me from switching my profile from public to private. Every time I go to delete the promotion it says error deleting. When I request a review it says an error occurred in requesting the review. Super frustrating, even tried deleting from the Facebook page but it says I cannot because the app generated the ad. Support for business profiles is very low on Instagram and yet they take your money for advertising with no issues what so ever"
Really good. It is okay but shares personal information install it but be careful
"problems with saving mobile data . the mobile data consumption of this app is terrible.  by having data saving active, the videos continue to play automatically"
"No Music sticker. In now Jan 2020, have abroad new iPhone 11, and most updated Instagram, and still no music sticker for my personal or business account. This is very annoying Its Feb 2019 I have the latest update and I still dont have the music sticker on my iPhone. Very disappointed Instagram. Ive tried every hack possible to get it. Any clue when this will roll out to everyone"
Help please. Hey Instagram my dms are not it says fail to send I reported the problem 2 times .I logged out and logged in i uninstall the app and download it back .I cleared the data I used and WiFi and nothing helped please fix it
"Adding music to stories isnt working. No matter how many times I restart the app or choose a different song, the media wont load and wont let you choose where in the song to snip from. Ive tried multiple different locations/wifi accts/data spots, and it never changes even when the internet is super fast and reliable for all other functions and apps. This is honestly one of the last features I go into instagram for, as the algorithm has made it impossible to actually see your friends/people you actually knows content. If this doesnt get fixed, consider me deleting. Please fix this as so many of us love this feature Thanks"
"*UPDATE REVIEW* Will you listen to us? Or ignore our feedback?. Are you going to ignore our feedbacks again and just do bug fixes? Suggested post should stay on the explore page not my Personal IG feed. My feed is now FLOODED with suggested pages  Im not remotely even interested in and I cant see ANY post from people Im following. The explore contents shouldnt spill over to personal timelines. No matter how far down I scroll its all suggestions, ALL OF IT. Suggested post only backfires on those pages because I will keep blocking them and they will lose the audience they seek. 2. My page, story, and Dm has been stalked by sex pages, all reported and yet all keep coming back. Yall might have a bug problem. 3. My notification settings has a lot turn off like whos going live and whos new to IG but I receive constant notifications when someone goes live or joins instagram that I might know"
"The worst. Downloaded a picture of my leg and one if my feet and captioned something like I will be selling feet pics soon and they immediately took it down saying I violated community guidelines. Then, after I appealed it they didn't restore it and said I was restricted from using some kind of tools idk. Mind you, I have a business account and this is literally my foot and leg. Dont understand why they would be a holes about something so simple. Awful for business"
Security issues. I wonder how much data you are keeping from our messages. Are messages being deleted from your servers? Ive noticed old deleted chats showing up out of the blue. Can you fix this? Ive seen lots of people with the same issue
Great App But. This is honestly my favorite social media platform but everytime I try posting a video it says no internet connection regardless of wether Im connected to my WiFi at home or using my data?? Another thing that would be nice of them to fix is video quality
"Can\'t upload and account is hacked. I love that isn&#39;t a is attached to Facebook and that my personal info, including birthdate is connected"
I was hacked. I thought I could trust this app with my information but clearly I was wrong since someone could so easily hack my account
"Spam notifications. Sends notifications that can not be turned off unless you turn off all notifications through phone settings. There are no settings to stop notifications, such as, person you may know is on IG, account you follow also follows this other account. Its spam"
"Search in conversation. I have like 8 Instagram accounts and they all set up differently, although they all private accounts. Only one account allows me to search in conversation for specific text messages. Why? I went to my chat settings trying to get my other accounts like that but I dont know what to do"
Delete off your phone. If you dont want zuck sucking up all your private data and selling it to profit then delete off your phone. Move to MeWe
"Restricted from liking posts. When I drop a like on some posts, especially hashtags I follow, I get banned for some reason for liking a post I turned off wifi to use data and then I dont have this problem anymore, but then when I dont have any available data for the day, I cant even drop a like at all What is going on??? Can you please fix this bug?"
Hacked over and over. Only giving this 5 stars so it shows on top of reviews. 1 STAR REVIEW. My main Instagram Ive had for 9 years was hacked multiple times by the same person. With screenshots of all their information Instagram still couldnt assist me on getting my account back. So appalled by how its been handled Im not going to bother with it anymore. Such a scary and stressful experience. How can a multimillion dollar company not have a customer service team where we can actually speak to a human being. Awful company
"This update is annoying. I had a business account and wanted to add music to a story but it told me that I wasnt allowed to have music as a business account....Why did I have it for so long then ig????  So I then switched to a personal and public account and it still says I have a business account and wont allow me to play music on my story, Ive deleted it and downloaded the app several times with the same results This update is terrible, the features arent the same for both of my accounts and theyre both public personal accounts. Please help"
"please. For the past few months I have been unable to edit anything about my account. My profile picture, activity status, changing my account to public etc. I am constantly given an error of Were sorry, but something went wrong. Try again. No matter what I do this does not change. Ive tried deleting the app and logging onto other devices but to no avail. My other Instagram account works fine. it is only my personal account that I am having issues with"
Action blocked. I recently created a business account linked to my Facebook page @cnah_cosmetics but I am unable to dm certain users every time I click on the message button it says Actions blocked why so ? Meanwhile if I use my personal account it wont say that
Horrible. I was hacked. My password was changed by the hacker. I was shut out. No help available as password was changed and when I tried to reset with phone and E mail Instagram reply was no known user. Im just plain screwed. Do not use Instagram
I love this app. I need help with my music career and INSTAGRAM and the affiliates who actually used the product themselves for personal use has BEEN MY BEST WAGER TO STARDOM I HAVE EVER CONSIDERED but still need tips from the top promoters and artists who uses this app so if anyone have any tips or suggestions PLEASE LET ME KNOW IVE TRIED EVERYTHING 
Instagram music on story doesnt work. Ive switched my account to personal from business deleted the app and redownloaded and tried stuff Ive found on google that would make it work and nothing has worked
Great Platform: Creepy Spy App Though. IG/Big Tech needs more God and Less Government Wish these big tech folks would chill out on all the invasive privacy attacks. Listening to us and advertising etc... freakin creeps
"Will not get the update. I already hate that Im seeing more ads in my newsfeed instead of seeing posts from folks I CHOOSE to follow, but now Im reading from the reviews here that with the new update, the newsfeed has gotten worse. I do NOT want to see suggested pages when Im scrolling - I only want to see the folks I follow, which I thought was the whole point of a personal newsfeed. I miss not being able to see my friends and familys posts regularly and I also miss my newsfeed being in chronological order. Yep, I refuse to update to the new version until they fix the newsfeed"
"faulty two-factor authentication. instagram is incredibly frustrating. i have 17k followers on my main account. a few days ago, i was locked out and asked to confirm my phone number. i made sure the number was correct, and sent the code. never got the text. resent the code. never got a text. closed the app and tried again. no text. logged out and logged back in. no text. i even deleted the app and redownloaded it, still with NO TEXT to my phone number despite the phone number entered being CORRECT. i cant refresh my feed or even see my own posts or dms. ive reported the problem 3 times now. i hate this app. they do not make solving issues a priority and for all i know, someone else could be in my account. they really need a personal phone number for customer service at Instagram HQ"
music. i got my music access taken away? i have a business account so i can see insights and stuff like that but now i cannot use music i like on my story even though i changed my account back to personal and i still cannot use it. my user is @kemihowe.xo if anyone wants to help.other than that very good app :)
Too hard to see friends. Too focused now on shopping and ads vs personal profiles
"Weird looking and picture cutting. I want previous version. It looks more of a Facebook helper not like a classy Instagram where we used to. Instagram-self is very popular but when it comes with Facebook, it looks cheap apps like others. I dont know why it cutting images when I upload many pictures. It auto suggest and provokes the images. I dont like it. I love Instagram and my personal rating is 5 but not recent updates, logos, connecting with messenger, etc. I want very previous version"
"Its just about adverts now. I used to love whiling away time browsing the shared photos of the people I follow and would often switch to look at the suggested feeds but now Im forced to just not use the app...Pictures no longer appear in any time based order and the number of adverts in the feed and especially in stories has just gone stupid. Its a shame. I know as a platform it has to make money but Ive now unfollowed all of the brands I used to take an interest in because its just sales pitch overload. Its lost touch with what it was in favour of trying to sell stuff that, seriously, has ANYONE responded to these adverts???I will be deleting the app and using my time differently from now on. A real shame. I used to really enjoy Instagram"
"Lots of bugs, I could use some help with it. Ive been using Instagram since 2017, its a lovely site and I&#39;m having a great time on it. That being said the bugs Ive been experiencing are CONTANT. Sometimes, my comment section on my post will be disabled for no reason, my followers arent explicit people and dont say a lot of rude things, yet my comments are randomly disabled. As of today, Ive had an issue which has disabled all of my Direct Messages entirely. I cant see the users, I cant talk to the users, I cant interact with them in any way shape or form and this confuses me as Ive never had a problem with the community guidelines. My account has 531 followers all of which I know in real life. It makes me upset that Im able to lose all that data and progress to a bug. Please fix the issue soon"
"Seriously, why can I never get any kind of support?. I am unable to reshare posts to my story which is incredibly frustrating since everyone else can and it is a FEATURE of instagram. I have reported this problem FIVE TIMES and still no one gets back to me or helps me with this issue. I have tried literally everything to try and fix this from my end and I cannot. I have had previous issues between my personal and business account and have NEVER found resolutions for those also. I am so infuriated that there is NO, and I mean ZERO support from Instagram. It has gone completely downhill"
"I dont know whats going on. I keep getting a notification saying I cant like or comment on posts. Recently the app logged me out and made me change my password, citing that Id given my information to a third party that will allow me to get more likes?? Like...if you look at my pics and the number of likes, youll know thats not true  how ridiculous. I was told if it happens again Ill lose access to my account :( not sure what to do because I didnt do anything in the first place"
"I can't contact support. I have the account login and password, but instagram doesn&#39;t let me log in, claiming to be a suspicious login, I have all the account information but I lost access to the email and the linked number.  I tried to contact Instagram in every way and Instagram didn&#39;t give me any answer"
"New update. Out my notifications back where they were, please and thank you. I dont shopping is NOT a priority on this app for me... all this stuff no one asked for and my business page still cant add music to stories smh"
"Suggestion. Maybe its me that doesnt know how.. but I would like the ability to only allow the people that follow me or I follow to watch my stories. I keep getting fake accts watching. The only way Ive found is to block them, custom block certain people etc. or make my acct private all together. Id like to have my acct public but just doesnt have a more user friendly way to select only my followers or who I follow to allow to watch :) open to suggestions if there is an easier way"
". im really annoyed bc ive been  shadowbanned for reposting a few things from @republicanparty etc on my story. i unfollowed all republican related accounts and denied third party apps access to my data (followers, preview, etc) but im still under the ban which has lasted for nearly 7 months now. IM TIRED OF IT AND WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMOVE IT RN"
Cant Login. I can no longer log into my account. The app says it sent a verification sms. Ive tried multiple times and I never received it. Ive tried longing in with backup codes and that didnt work either. After all the attempts I reached out for support and they just send me Instagrams new privacy policy. Whats going on?
Bring Back the Old Menu Layout. 11/17/2020Bring back the old menu layout I now have to dig to post content and see information about likes and comments. Instagram is now pushing its marketplace and reels. Hate the new layout. And is it a coincidence that the market place tab is where the like data/comments section used to be? I think not
"Hacked. A lot of people I follow have been getting hacked and people cant get there Instagram back because they change their password and other information. Please help fix this problem, they keep saying stuff like this Ill cash app, Apple Pay or Zelle $2500 to $3000 to people that can pronounce a name start with G and end with K the giveaway start now.... its really annoying"
"WHY?. First yall messed up the algorithm so badly, it was already difficult enough and now this hideous update? Please for the love of god CHANGE IT BACK AND USE A NORMAL ALGORITHM. I havent seen one person say they like it, if youre intent is to get people to stop using Instagram then youre on the right track but if not then this needs to CHANGE BACK"
"Disappointing. I made many Instagram accounts for personal uses and public use. I dont mind for the public one but I do mind the personal one. Most of my likes, I can not see, it upsets me deeply since the likes on there are of my family back in my home country and friends who left for college/uni. I would like to just get back my likes, and have reported it, but no one does anything. I hope Instagram can give back the old likes wheres there no limits. But I guess they wont do anything again"
Someone hacked me. Someone hacked  my account and this new update stinks bro..I havent been on my account at night at all Also it say I have been on a service thats gives me likes and followers when I havent been on any of those websites...And when I try to tell them someone was posing as me they didnt believe me at all  And so my private pictures Is still up- and the account never got tooken down I have deleted the app 
"I keep getting this message every time I try to log in to my Instagram. Thanks for Providing Your InfoWe\'ll review your info and if we can confirm it, you\'ll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours"
"Absolutely no response. I have been on Instagram for years, and I use it for both personal and business. After getting a new phone, I have been unable to regain access to my account due to the Authenticator not being sent to my new phone. I have literally left over 10 voicemails, sent over 100 messages through their help site, tried contacting them through other platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, even LinkedIn and Twitter. After learning from several others that this happened to them, you have to create an entirely new account because they will not respond. Whatever you do, do NOT set up Authenticator, and make sure your privacy settings are off before changing to a new phone"
Fonts. For some reason I don&#39;t have the new fonts and color wheel on my app. I am a social media rep for my job and I can&#39;t seem to access these new updates on either my business or personal accounts and it&#39;s frustrating I have checked the app for updates and they are current as well as tried uninstalling and redone loading... help please
"Hey question. How can I use the music button on my business account for Instagram? Its not working, Ive tried deleting the app and reinstalling it and Im on the newest version. What gives? Other people I know who have a business account, the music button shows up on their stories but its no where to be seen on mine. I also in addition to this now cant have a business account as I changed my account to personal to try to solve the lack of music. Why is this app continually glitchy??? I need my account to be business as well as have a reliable music option. Is it really that hard?"
Update. I think its stupid to show suggested people I obviously dont follow on my timeline. The purpose of the timeline is to be for personal preference if I wanted random people I would go to the explore page not my timeline  hate the updates
Not good. Had this app for a will but now it will not let me into my personal pics and likes
"Unable to choose Facebook account to share my posts. I really liked the ability to choose which Facebook account (page or personal profile) I wanted to post on. Now I only have ONE option. I really dislike this Before I could navigate and switch to post in my Facebook page or profile, now I if want to change I have to change the whole goddamn settings and that is really bothering. La cagan"
"Disabled my account randomly. I have had Instagram for years, recently I had been struggling with having my account hacked, and today opened Instagram on my phone to a message saying my account had been disabled and to log in to get instructions for getting it back. Which would be fine if Instagram let me log back in, instead every time I go to log in Im asked to enter my phone number to get a code that never comes to my phone, am told that theres an error, or that my account simply doesnt exist. Im pretty upset considering I have memories on there that I have no other way of accessing and didnt do anything to deserve having my account disabled"
Hacked App. This is not the app updated version of Instagram the hacker has some how cloned the app and signing in to a browser not connected to the App this Facebook and Instagram Hacking is an epidemic and no matter how you change passwords this same hacker been hacking my social media Instagram and Facebook for 5 years straight and nothing has been done with the complaints made it a win lose battale and an invasion of ones privacy you have to do better in this area. when I sign in there is 2 sign in on my email therefore the app has been cloned or somehow being signed in from a browser but not by me 
"Its fine. Use this and theyll know more about u than u in a week, track everything u do and analyse it"
"Accounts. I have insta gram accounts of my own and work and they seem to merge, theres also a cross of privacy problems if someone could contact me about this I have tried to  kind regards Danielle fyvie"
"Get Your  Together IG. Account getting Hacked. dear instagram,please make changes to the app. I wish to put my account on private,but it&#39;s on business and not personal. I don&#39;t like the fact i can&#39;t put my account on private. I will like to put my account private even if it&#39;s business account. I had multiple accounts impersonating others and messaging me my account is business not personal. I know you can put a personal account on private,but i want to be able to make business account on instagram also Private. So please, make a change.Get your  Together Instagram. My account got hacked and IG is making it easier for people to hack accounts. Get your  Together and Make Changes. Hate IG. My account has been hacked and now when i try login into my instagram account says it&#39;s temporary locked. I try to change my password by email and says oops an eror occured"
not happy. instagram has failed to protect the privacy of users. an account has been impersonating me and they will not take the account down. i am disgusted and feel violated yet instagram will not respond for my complaints and reports. Do not get instagram they will not protect you
Please give me my account back. Hey Instagram please give me my account back you guys band me because it said someone was trying to hack my account and it was only going to be band for a little while but its been 2 weeks and I still cant use my account its not big account but I have some pictures there that I only have in there no where else and I dont wanna lose it. And I have not done nothing bad
I cant login to my existing account. Yeah what the heck instagram for a multi million dollar company you guys still cant fix this issue everybody has and its that it doesnt allow people to log into their accounts Do something about it instead of spying on us and using our data and tracking us with ads I hope you guys see this because its unacceptable it must be fixed ASAP
Too many fake accounts. You all need to figure out a way to shutdown these fake accounts with stolen pics. I report at least 5/day. I lost track of how many I reported today. Its quite annoying. Its all the same scam
"Absolutely horrible update. The new update does not have the average users interest at heart. Theyve put their two least utilized functions (Reels &amp; Shopping) in the exact same place their most utilized functions (New Post &amp; Activity) were located. As someone who uses Instagram for personal and business pages, this is highly dysfunctional for everyday use. I understand Instagram probably spent a ton of time and resources bringing these new functions to the platform, but they are not working for a reason. Please stop forcing them on us. This update reminds me of when Snapchat rolled out their new app design and it was a massive bust. I have always loved Instagram, but they will lose devoted users if this keeps happening"
"Reshaping to stories. Okay so on my professional, public account I know I have reshaping to stories ON HOWEVER when I try to share a story from my professional account on my personal account, I dont get the option to share to my story. I dont understand what the problem is, it must be with Instagram itself because I have done all the troubleshooting and nothing changes. Ive had this issue with friends stories, who also have public profiles and have sharing on. Instagram, fix this. Youve been around for a while, man"
Why. Why did yall delete the option of downloading data
"Error account system. Account: ana_otero13My account was taken away or blocked by mistake, I sent all the data for confirmation and I still cannot access it.  I lost many photos and friends.  please return it to me.  I already sent all the forms and the photo as you indicated.  and nothing"
Add some privacy options. Why dont you add options to hide some accounts you are following from others/ and hide mutual friends from some people
Followers. Please fix followers privacy
"Disappointed with the new update. Please read the new update carefully. I will not be allowing you to track my location, tell me to wear a mask, access my photos anytime you want and all the other things you are doing to help improve my experience. Im concerned where this is going"
Loading. I try to scroll through my feed or other accounts it says cant load or no internet connection even though I have internet and cell data on
"Take My Money. I used to be able to promote posts no problem, but for the past month now, it just says \There was a problem while accessing your ad account. Please try again later.\ - I have gone through every little bit of troubleshooting possible, I have contacted support... all to no avail. Not to mention, I have an old account I don\'t ever use (with no posts or followers anymore), and they will NOT reset my password for this account via email link - they only send me the login link when I request a password reset. (so I can access the account just fine, but I can\'t even delete it). This old account also will NOT log out anywhere I try to log it out from, it\'ll just say \error\ every single time I try.Instagram, you have so so many issues. It\'s no wonder that so many people I know are leaving the app for good"
"Bcglassman. My account has been disabled for no reason. I have done nothing wrong, I am a legal business in Canada I have a business license for selling Glass Art I pay PST and GST tax to the goverment every month. I have items that I need to ship out ASAP and I do not have access to the buyers shipping information because my account has been temporarily disabled for absolutely no reason. Can you please review my account immediately so I can get back to business and tell my customers that I am going to be shipping out the items they have paid for immediatly. Customers have already paid for my glass art and I have to ship it out but I do not know how to find the shipping information because it was only in my messages and you guys have banned my account temporarily. Please review my account immediately I need to gain access to my Instagram so I can get back to conducting business. Please review immediately Instagram team.

Please help me get my account back I did not break any rules Instagram team please help me"
"Deactivate my account without any obvious reason. they deactivated my account despite that i have not posted anything , and when i wanted to reactivate my account , the sent me an email requesting personal info. and face picture . An unusual way of Authentication"
"A lot of scammers. I get people scamming me saying Ive won an iPhone 13 every day. Usually theyre trying to hack my Instagram and sell it,and its happened before and I lost all my memories.And on top of that,I cant even fast forward through the Instagram videos that are on peoples profile anymore. I used to love that new feature,now its gone. That was a bad update. I want the last update back. The one that let you fast forward through videos. (Not reels or stories,just the videos)"
No one can share my Stories. No one can ever share the stories I tag them in onto their story. I have checked all my privacy settings and all the settings are set up as they should be to allow people to share my stories. I have asked for help from instagram to restore this feature with little help
"No private messages notifications. I use instagram as my direct way of messaging friends a family, but for around 2 weeks i havnt had any notifications showing that i have messages. I get notifications when im in the app, but when off the app or phone switched off i get no notifications at all. I have checked all settings both instagram and apple settings to make sure no notifications are turned off etc, everythings fine there. I have restarted my phone, deleted the app and reinstalled it, made sure both my phone and the app is update and still nothing Instagrams whats going on?? Im missing important messages as this is my direct contact and id ideally not like to change to a different app. I have used instagram for 8 years and this has next happened"
"WayTo Intrusive. The app is way to intrusive into ones personal information, even after saying NO do not sync to that item. And when attempting to delete an account there needs to be away to do so in the app"
"DMs Blocked. Ive never had a problem with Instagram until now. Im not sure if its the update or what, but I can not open my DMs. Ive logged into another device but my DMS still wont load. This is beyond frustrating because I cant communicate or answer questions to clients whose personal information I do not have. Please fix this asap"
Instagram. Sick to death off this now I have been logged out my personal account and now not able to log back in  useless
"Great app, could be better. IMHO too much attention is placed on ads and sponsors algorithms. I know you have to make money and data mining is lucrative. Still its a great app"
"Cant share to story. i cant share any posts from instagram to my story, it seems everyone else can and i still dont have the option. its absolutely frustrating. ive done everything like update the app, delete and redownload, mess with privacy settings, nothing works"
Annoying reels + ads takeover. Instagram ads are literally every third story now. Reels are the only priority the app cares about and lately its become a lot less fun to be on this platform. This app used to be the main way Id run my business but long gone are the days where a single photo has the reach it used to. Feels like Ive outgrown the parts I love about this app and that all theyre doing is pivoting to TikTok so IG remains relevant 
"i cant download instagram. i deleted instagram for personal reasons , but i cant download it again it shows that the app is downloaded but its not"
Latest Update Terrible. I absolutely hate the latest update. From a business perspective it has completely destroyed the workflow of the app. Notifications are now only accessible via the home page and have been moved to the top right of the screen which on most modern (and larger) phones is less ergonomic and a pain to access. Reels have been added to where the new post button used to be which is very unhelpful and the focus has been significantly shifted towards their TikTok obsessed reel feature rather than grid posts and stories. I dont care what my personal Instagram app looks like but could you at least keep business pages more user friendly please and thank you
Fed up. Still unable to add someone elses post to my story. Ive checked to make sure that the privacy setting in my account and of the accounts I am trying to share to my story allow that and it does. Still no option available. Zero help from instagram after contacting support either
New update. Im not too much of a fan of the new update to the app in where it directs you to suggested pages to follow once youve caught up on your feed. It takes away from my feed being personal and custom to what I made it. It feels like Im scrolling the popular page with random accounts instead of my personal feed which is disappointing
"Glitches?. I have no idea, but Instagram has been glitching for me. I do not know if this was just me but I asked my friends and they did not have the same problems. It would not let me like anything saying it was blocked for me and it was to help follow the guidelines. It had never done this before so I was really confused when I checked my feed. Also besides this I wasnt able to change my password, I was very aggravated and I wanted to change it for privacy reasons so when it said to go check my messages and I could change it right after. I assumed it would work, it had not and I was very confused. Besides that the app is fun, if you use it correctly and that is why Im giving it three stars.Edit: I was talking to a friend when I tried to unfollow someone because I do not talk to them and we are not friends. So I tried to unfollow them and it said the action was blocked once again, I am getting very aggravated at this and am thinking about deleting the app, I do hope that Instagram fixes this"
"Account hacked. Somehow, my account was hacked. I did not give out my password. Instagram claims that I shared my password with a like and follow bot. I did not. Now, I cant like or follow anybody. I just want to go back to normal. I cant appeal, and Im stuck with an account that cant do anything. I dont have a lot of followers or likes, so I dont know what their issue is. Also, I have my account set to private. Please help"
Hacked & locked out. I logged out of my account for a few days a few months ago and havent been able to get back in since. I followed all the directions on Instagrams page for resetting my password and I never get a response to reset it. Ive tried contacting Instagram but no response. My page was probably hacked but I have no way of getting access to it now and now is the WORST time to not be connected to social media since I have nothing else to do. I have YEARS of photos and memories that are just gone with the wind now and Instagram/Facebook is being super unresponsive. Ugh
"Unable to upload full size photos. The Instagram resolution limitation for pictures is very user unfriendly , cumbersome and irritating.Most pictures need to cropped using a different app before they can uploaded and the beauty of the picture is lost.The whole purpose of sharing the pictures is lost"
Bad customer service. I got my account hacked and instagram blacked it. The hacker change my account info with info that is jot mine so i&#39;m unable to get the code to log back in. I contacted instagram and they send me an email with some steps i needed to do. I did and send them all the info they asked me. That was more than a week ago and still haven&#39;t received any response back. Really frustrated and disappointed by instagram services
"Worst app. Uses your camera to spy on you even when youre not on the app, collects facial recognition, keeps tabs on your location, browsing history of all other sites and apps. Allows photos of dead soldiers and videos of war crimes to stay up even when reported by hundreds... 0/10"
Story share not working??. I have a personal and business account on Instagram which I have been using for years and used to love the appRecently people are unable to share my story on Instagram even though my business account is public. Its frustrating as its a useful business promotion tool which has unfortunately been disabled. I have ensured to enable this feature in the setting to allow all accounts to mention and reshare my story. I have contacted Instagram help centre but have yet to hear anything back. Please could someone enable this feature?
Instagram account disabled for no reason. I have had my Instagram account since 2015. A few months ago it was hacked and then very quickly disabled. I have submitted report after report after report and NOTHING has worked. I've typed messages where I can explaining and still. They say my password had appeared in a data leak but that I was violating their community guidelines by either artificially purchasing followers/likes or posting the same thing over and over again. I spent years creating a stupidly perfectly crafted instagram account and i NEVER bought likes or followers so the only thing I can come up with is it was hacked. I'm not sure what to do at this point and honestly very upset. This is such a disappointing situation and it would seem that it's becoming incredibly common. I just want my stupid instagram account back
Instagram has been awesome over the years. Ive been using Instagram for years for personal uses and I just recently switched over for content purposes and its been great
"No personal customer service. Recently someone made a fake profile posing as me. I reported it and many friends reported it. But it seems to still be up, even though they are using my name and face to sell pornography. Trying to report it has been a nightmare there is no one in customer service to talk to. Today there seems to be a lot of glitches on the app and nothing is loading and no messages go through. I love Instagram, its my favorite app but this week has been rough as far as feeling confident about the service. It would be awesome if there is someone to actually talk to in customer service instead of the impersonal FAQs and the ability to complain only in the categories preselected when something goes very wrong or privacy is being violated. Hope for better Im the future"
"Terrible. So glitchy, so many adds, whenever I try to delete a collection of saves it never works, it always takes me out of the video and glitches half way, also not to mention no privacy on here. Instagram has been going downhill and it continues to get worse"
someone hacked my insta and it wont let me back in. someone hacked my insta and dmd eveyone spam mail
"Please fix the unlink from facebook issue. I got my account deactivated on facebook and i had it attached to my personal, I can no longer get in the Facebook; thus making it impossible to unlink. So I cant switch back to a personal account and private it. I am getting harassed by random people and want my account private but cant. This is an invasion of my privacy, and it has been over a year now. Please fix this guys, its affecting not only me but my businesses"
"Racist. They let people post photos in blackface next to confederate flags but wont take them down for hate speech because they respect everyones right to believe different things but when you repost things ABOUT police brutality one report gets them taken down. Id like to highlight that Mark Zuckerberg, the man known for over 11 scandals dealing with OUR data, is a Trump supporter. So I guess it makes sense"
"There is not support. My personal account has been hacked and  consequently locked by Instagram. Despite Ive changed my phone number for the authentication and turn on the code Authenticator option, I cant recover my Instagram because the first step to check my identity is with my old phone number.. Instagram doesnt give the option to use a email for the recover or similar..there is not support..I need help please"
My profile section doesnt work. I can not open my personal page because when I click the button a black screen is opening. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it did not solve. I can not control my personal info and sharings that I shared before
Hacked no help. My account got hacked.  The information in the help center did not help recover my account because the hacked changed my email and phone number. I have exhausted every avenue I have been able to find to get assistance from IG and NOTHING This hacker got access to my pictures and is posting fake videos to my story. Need some assistance. Can be reached via DM on my other IG account Inspired_diosa2020
Instagram  app from your truly. Greatest app ever so many wonderful opportunities there w manageable business through business profile and even flex your creative side with you personal profile I definitely enjoy it and so will you love to catch u there @sanae_proctor  see soon 
"Problem. Hey  I have a problem i cant access to my account on instagram, its stuck .. please help"
"Reels not working. I have been an instagram user for many years. I created a business account 6 months ago and I do not have the reels feature enabled on my business account. I have access to this on my personal account, so it has nothing to do with whether the phone is up to date etc... which it is. I have sent Instagram a number of reports but have had nothing rectified since September 2020 and have not had any response or solution. Shame on you Instagram"
Instagram hacked. My instagram was hacked and they changed all my info and locked me out of my account and I can't revert the changes sent to my email. Instagram has a terrible support team and has done nothing to help me get my account back. There is literally no one to contact about this
"Bad update. I only follow less than 120 people so my feed isnt spam with hacks, one a be super stars,  and people who copy other peoples work and give no credit. This bad update now covers my feed with that crap and no longer have my friends and family feed stay up after a see there post"
Choose either your privacy or this app. The fact that this app knows what you have been browsing on a different browser on the device or on completely different devices connected to your home network is downright scary and very troubling
"Instagram is the BEST. Such an Incredible App ... Professional, fun n very artistic... I love Instagram so much  "
"Customer service is essentially nonexistent. I have been having issues with my account getting hacked so I have to constantly be changing the password to my account. Recently Instagram decided to kick me off my account until I could prove my identity. They sent me and email telling me to reply with a picture of me holding up a picture of a code they sent me. Except they didnt send me a code. And now they are ignoring my emails trying to reach out to resolve this issue. Instagram doesnt care about its users. Especially if you dont have tens of thousands of followers. Youre just another one of its millions of users and if you have a problem, its easier for them to ignore you than actually fix your problem"
Okay App. What is it going to take to get this app to work horizontally on my I-pad?  Get it together Instagram / Facebook.Plus it is weird how you get notifications but it is almost impossible to look at them or answer them.  I am ready to delete Instagram and FacebookTired of dealing with mediocrity especially when I know you are using all of my info and my actions against me and the rest of the world
Account hacked. My account was hacked by someone in Texas USA. Im from Uk. Instagram are refusing to help me. Can someone please get intouch asap
"Account deactivated. NO HELP from IG. My account got randomly deleted after asking me to confirm a code sent to my personal number. I did it, and a pop-up saying something similar to thank you for providing your information, we will review the information, and it can confirm you will be able to access your account within 24hrs.I waited 24 hours, but my account was deactivated for violating terms of use. NEVER have I ever did anything different than post pictures and stories of my everyday life, and chatted with friends and family who live in Italy (I live in Australia). Ive tried EVERYTHING, sending a mugshot with a code, my passport. No help whatsoever, no replies at all. Its been 2 months.Ive had this account for 10 years. The lack of any assistance provided by Instagram and Facebook is truly disappointing, and heartbreaking.@chrismatei on Instagram.Sad"
Frustrating. Have 2 accounts on Instagram and one has instagram reels which is my personal one but my professional business one does not. I have emailed and reported this problem several times but there has been no solution. I have updated and reinstalled the app several times. Horrible
"Use camera in background without my permission. use the camera in the background without my permission and i was not taking a picture, which is contrary to the standards of privacy and disgrace to them"
Ive been locked out of my personal account for two months. I had Instagram for a long time but recently I was locked out of my personal account about 2 months ago and after repeatedly reaching out to Instagram for help. Absolutely no help. If someone from Instagram could please help that would be great
"ISSUES. Instagram keeps freezing my account stating I am using a third party to get likes. Ive tried every which way to contact them to dispute this claim, but they refuse to reply. I am trying to get any information from them to prove this, but cant. It seems the only way to get followers to follow people and apparently that is a problem"
"Bugs. me and my friends like to send photos back and forth on this app and most will have a conversation implemented into them. We use this app because i no longer use snapchat and most of my friends don&#39;t either. So this is really the main way i talk to them, but i can barley even talk to them because of this dumb app lol. The chats that are embedded into the photos NEVER go through and it is extremely aggravating and makes me and my friends mad. We are always having to repeat ourselves to each-other and it just ruins the conversation in general. Needs To Be Fixed"
Instagram is acting up. Honestly been using Instagram for years I have a few accounts on my one and its saying I have messages and when I go to see I dont actually have any messages its just acting up in general and I cant add more stuff to my personal stories no more Instagram needs to fix it
"Notifications???. I have been using Instagram for almost 2 years now and I just upgraded my phone iPhone 7 to iPhone 11 and I just cant seem to receive notifications when my buddies are talking to me or when Im chatting to my buddy who doesnt have a phone and when I checked my notification settings, everything option was already saying either ON or on the EVERYONE setting can you please give me some advice or the solution to this. PLEASE?"
My personal opinion. A Racist app
Former usersnames?. I find it an invasion of privacy for Instagram to publicly display our former usernames in our about this account section. Do you think I want my followers to see the name I care up with in 8th grade ???
Bugs. U need to fix the app from random stealing pictures  off people profiles
Instagram reels. Reels feature doesnt appear on my creator account with over 10k followers but shows up on my personal account with 1k. This makes no sense why cant I access it from my creator account
One star for Fascism. When you start to suggest my posts are harmful for sharing truth that counters your personal agenda it is the very definition of fascism. Zuckerberg and his gang of soy infused betas need to be jailed for their taking advantage of humans Crimes against humanity #FJB
"Horrible idea - suggested posts. No one wants the technology company that already listens and watches you through microphones and cameras for ad targets, to have targeted Follow suggestions now. When is it going to stop?  Oh yeah, Zuckerberg is at the forefront...completely clueless to his user base and will ruin an experience to collect and sell more data or to get another zero added to his net worth. Youre trash Zuckerberg. TRASH"
Not letting me change back to business account. I recently was troubleshooting a separate problem in which Instagram was not allowing me to connect to a Facebook account. To do this I switched my business account back to a personal account and Im now trying to switch back to a professional account and it keeps sending me error please try again later. This is so annoying and needs to be fixed
"Cant share posts to my story. Its been nearly 2 years since this feature has been out and I have yet to have it on my account. I have 2 accounts, one for my business and one for my personal page. My business account has this feature but not my personal one. Its so frustrating because I want to be able to advertise my business by sharing my posts. I feel like all of my friends have this feature except me. Its very annoying"
"Big Problem. Last week I changed from a personal page to a buisness page. This told me I had to reconnect my Facebook buisness page to my account. Ive tried to do this 4 times a day for the past week, I keep getting a something went wrong we are working on it message. Today I saw there was an update, and I thought it would be fixed. WRONG. Same thing on Facebook, total error messages. What is the problem? It worked just fine and then didnt work at all. You own both companies, this should not be happening. Twitter is still set up, you own that too. Unacceptable"
"Great app . Great app  Love this app for sharing personal images, investigating personal interests, and following my kids and friends personal adventures"
awful. stop stealing info from us
"Terrible update. Why instagram would replace the notifications tab with a shopping tab is absolutely beyond me. This is an app TO SHARE PHOTOS AND MOMENTS, not an app where you blow money. It took me about two days to even find the notifications tab (if you cant find it its in the top right corner of your ig). Just FYI to the developers of this app, people are definitely NOT happy with the update and I wonder if you even thought it through beforehand. Also, I wont be buying any of the overpriced plastic baby earrings (this is whats being sold on ig, just small businesses looking for a quick buck). So I think its safe to say, not your best moment instagram"
"Not happy and cant get any help. All of a sudden I can no longer share posts or reels, whether they are other public posts and reels or my own on both my personal and business account. I tried calling and leaving a message. No one has called back. I tried looking up on Help. I wrote to Instagram twice. Not one reply. I tried to Google which didnt help. I want to know why I cant share public reels, posts and stories in my story anymore It wont even let me share my own post to my story It is ruining how I use it for business and taking away the fun of sharing on my personal page. So if you use Instagram and ever need help, it is basically impossible. I feel really frustrated with this app now. Ive never encountered a problem that didnt go away in a few days or with an app update. My phone and the app ARE BOTH UPDATED and Im still having this issue. In the share to story section in settings, the only option there now is to share to messages or Facebook. The option to share to my story is GONE CAN SOMEONE PLEASE RESPOND FROM INSTAGRAM? Im really upset. Its been almost two months now"
"Im so frustrated. First of all, my account was hacked earlier last week. I tried for FIVE HOURS to get it back, but whoever hacked it changed my password and the email before I could try to reset my password. So there goes all of my posts and my nearly 2,000 followers... To top it off, Instagram has no way to contact an actual human to get help, and nothing on the help center helped me with the situation I was in. I reluctantly started a new account, and now almost a week later, Instagram keeps telling me that I am blocked from liking pictures and following people. Everyday it says Im blocked from these actions until the next day, and the next day comes and it continues to happen. I dont know how to fix this bit Im seriously starting to get fed up with this app"
"Share Post to Stories. I love IG ESP where you can share posts to your stories   Although lately this feature isnt working for myself and several others I have found out. I have followed instructions on deleted app and reinstalling, changed some privacy settings and nothing works. I read on one post where IG releases things and it gets sent to some devices but not all, which doesnt make sense"
/. This app is really good I have 2 personal accounts and another 2 fan pages  but every time I go to click on my profile it turns black and when I go to unfollow someone to kinda just refresh my pages it says action blocked and I dont know why 
Bad rating. The updates are all terrible. You put true information as false. This app is terrible
"Terrible. Ive had my Instagram account for over 10 years now and out of nowhere got logged out and my account is just GONE. Completely dissapeared. Cant find my username anywhere, all posts where I was tagged are untagged, all past comments on friends post, GONE. My account vanished into thin air and because INSTAGRAM DOESNT HAVE AN EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER SUPPORT there is no way for me to ask why the heck happened and if I can have my Instagram back. Im extremely frustrated and honestly just very upset because all of my pictures and videos though out the years have just disappeared and it seems like theres nothing I can do about it.Its been over a month or 2 now and I can not access my account and it is just gone. It wasnt because it was disabled or anything like that.Instagram just took away my account for no reason. Please find a solution to this.Ive read millions of comments and reports across the web having the same problem as me right now. We are devastated. Please please find a solution.The technical error message that I had was thanks for providing your info. Well review your info and if we can confirm it, youll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hoursIts been approximately 1,000 hours not 24.The millions of others that seem to have had this happen to them said it was possibly Instagram thinking there was suspicious activity with a follower app.Whatever the problem may be...INSTAGRAM PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.VERY IMPORTANTPLEASE FIND A WAY FOR ALL THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO GET THEIR ACCOUNT, PHOTOS, HARD WORK, AND MEMORIES BACK.Truly sad. People use this platform for work and business and life and they took it away from them.Please just do something about it.Thank you"
Great. I can share what I want and switch in between accounts for business or personal Great
THE SHOP FEATURE. The new removal of the activity center and subsequent implementation of the shopping tab is GARBAGE. THEY ARE SHOVING ADS AND TRACKED ITEMS DOWN YOUR THROAT FOR YOU TO BUY... what an idea right? Now you no longer see whos responded liked or followed you without doing a dance to find the activitys tab which no longer shows notifications. Stupidest thing since copying Snapchat stories... I hate you
"Hasnt worked in months. Im not sure when it started, but with every new update, Instagram gets worse. It has stopped working altogether at this point, even after Ive restarted my phone, redownloaded it, tried everyday on different wifi and on data, etc. At this point, Im on the login page and everytime I try to log in, it says no internet. This happens everytime. I have internet and every other app works fine. Ive almost given up altogether"
about your profile update. i dont appreciate how yall keep updating this stupid app trying to reveal our personal information. there should be no reason why people should be able to click on someones page and see their old usernames. this is seriously annoying
"Fix the bugs please. the App has not been doing its job well for a few days.  impossible to see who has followed your stories, impossible to view the data of the promoted posts, impossible to access the photos to be able to download them in the stories.  Whats happening ?????"
"stupidest update. WHY WOULD YOU HIDE POSTS FROM PEOPLE I FOLLOW? SO ANNOYING, WHEN I WANT SUGGESTED POSTS I GO ON MY EXPLORE PAGE NOT PERSONAL FEED"
"Do not want the shopping section. The new layout is terrible in my personal opinion. A customizable layout option would be amazing so I could remove both the reels and shopping section from the bottom row because I am absolutely not interested in these parts of the app. Obviously some people are interested in this, and so being able to cater the apps layout to personal desires would be wonderful. However, Instagram doesnt offer users these capabilities and would rather force feed more and more content upon us all"
Cant share to Story. Its Instagram its great but my business account cannot share posts to story for some reason but my personal can and its very frustrating especially for a business account.Ive talked to several people with the same problem and no one has every received any help or advice from Instagram
"the drafts. ive been using instagram for about a year, and ive never had any issues with it. recently tho, its been taking away my drafts which makes it annoying to keep track on when i want to post for my editing accounts. even after i re type everything back in, a couple minutes later its gone again"
Crap app. Why can we still not edit comments? Why does my booksta account not have the same messaging features as my personal account? Ugh I hate the app but I use it because I love connecting with other readers on my booksta account. Im about to delete my personal account because I hate it so much
Disappointing. I recently decided to start unfollowing pages that I felt were negative and spam acts as well only to be restricted from doing so by the Instagram community. In addition Im still unable to like ANYONES post and unfollow pages even though this is supposed to MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT Not happy with this and very disappointed to say the least
Instagram has poor customer support. My account was hacked a week ago and I tried contacting customer support about this issue. No one has responded to me and it has been a week. I cant log into my account at all and it appears my whole account has been disabled. Ive had my Instagram account for 4 years and have all my friends and beloved pictures on there. Its a tragedy that Instagram support wont help me recover my account or even respond to me at all. Now I will have to create a new account and start completely over
"Love you guys But this bug is driving me mad. Hey IG I love yall and this platform- but theres a bug thats been driving me mad. As a heavy user of Instagram, I really rely on being able to access my DMs. General, personal, and requests. However, no matter how many times I delete, log out, log in, or re download or refresh the app, I cant access my DMs They load forever and never end up popping up, eventually I just get an error message. Its so frustrating, I used to only not be able to see my requests from the app but now I cant see any at all. Please fix this, or if theres a way I can that I havent tried yet, please let me know"
Clunky and primitive. Could be a lot better:- Have landscape mode instead of being so fixated on portrait mode- Allow app to rotate so I dont have to look at it sideways on my iPad (in a case w/ keyboard)- Encourage horizontal 16:9 videos and full screen photos instead of everything being super tiny. Also vertical videos are the worst. - Allow user to customize different reactions other than likes  i.e condolences - Allow a different caption for each photo when sharing multiple pix - Dont allow followers to track your activity
"Instagram. Ive had it for a few years now, its quite good but just recently, I decided to unfollow some people and then Instagram said my account was compromised for some odd reason. Then it told me to reset my password and I realised that I had typed my email in wrong so, I dont know what to do. I cannot change my password or access any of my personal information to change the email. Please help.My account is called @physicshelp1729"
not getting any notifications. So i have my main account and i have a finsta (spam account) and i also have a account where im selling my clothes that i dont wear anymore. so i get notifications for my main account but i dont get any notifications for my spam or my clothing account which is bad because i dont see if anyone dmd me or commented on a photo saying they want that specific item. sometimes i dont get the message till an hour or two later because i dont get any notifications ive looked up online how to fix this. its the usual restart your device uninstall and reinstall make sure in your phone and app settings that notifications are on and ive done all of those and nothings helped i dont know if anyone else is having this problem or not but they need to fix this
Unable to load with out WiFi. Love insta and the app in general but cant for some reason use the app with out WiFi even though have a lot of mobile data? Unsure why
I HATE UR APP. I cant even GET IT Its says payment information even tho it was free for my BFF
"Get rid of the saved audio notifications . I normally enjoy Instagram, but please get rid of the this many people used this saved audio. I dont care. The notifications are soo soooo sooooooooooooooo annoying"
"Instagram is just getting worse. Its getting worse with every update For one, I cant post multiple photos at a time anymore Two,  I hate that the bottom that use to be in the bottom of our personal page is gone when I want to just post a post (not a story with the dumb plus button) Its not user friendly anymore and Im very technically inclined About to delete after 9 years. Change it all back"
"Lia. Instagram used to be my favorite social media to use during my free time or even just to procrastinate when I need to do something. Its an amazing app and I really love it but recently I have started to experience a few glitches in my DMs. Such as:Dms appear and disappear and scramble up for no reason at all (This happens on my fan account, so I can tolerate this)Dms dont even load, no matter how good the WiFi is and no matter how much I reinstall the app. (This happens on my personal account and thats really hard to deal with because I get important messages that I cant access due to this.) I can only see the DM if I search for the username then click message. But if I open all my direct messages, nothing comes up.And yes I have tried to reinstall the app, get better WiFi, use other devices, etc.I hope my problem gets solved soon.Sincerely,Lia"
"Stop with the suggested posts. Instagram, I have a few problems with the  new algorithm, format. First, just let me keep scrolling through my old posts please. If I wanted to see suggested posts, I would just click on the explore section. I dont always get to actually look at a post the first time I see it.  Second, why arent you showing me all of the posts from the people I follow? Its really disappointing that Im missing things from friends, particularly artists who are sharing their personal work. Third, its really discouraging when I get a lot of interaction from one post and then go weeks without my work being shown to a large audience because Im not fitting into the algorithm correctly. ????"
"Great. Use it every day, hours of entertainment for the low low price of all my personal data and endless irrelevant adverts Im spammed with. 11/10"
"Why are you hiding my friends posts. Youve now changed my personal feed to have ads and suggested content. If I wanted that I would go to the explore page, now I cant scroll through and see my friends posts. I know youre going though an identity crisis with the popularity of TikTok, but I didnt realize youve completely lost your core functionality. Unsubscribe"
"Meta has the worst support. Fiancées account got hacked and every time shes done the face recovery the hacker has kicked her out of her account by changing everything from email, phone number, and username. Now when we try to get in using need more help it keeps telling her to try again later. Maybe actually have someone helping users of your platform instead of a computer"
Cant get to personal page. I dont know what happened but my personal page on Instagram is blank. This happened when I downloaded the app on my new iPhone 11. I can get to everything else EXCEPT my personal page. I see to love insta but this is ridiculous ESPECIALLY with an update. Someone help
"The app just keeps getting worse. This used to be an app of self expression and seeing what youre friends were up to. Now its just one big platform trying to sell you stuff. The most recent up date where they moved the make a post button makes it so that you accidentally click on the reel button. Sorry to break it to you Instagram, but Tik Tok still exists. The old notifications button was also moved so you accidentally click on the shopping button all the time I dont want to buy things from Instagram, and I can tell that your actively trying to sell things to me all the time Every 2-5 post on my feed are advertisements And I have to actively scam the algorithm to get posts back on my feed that I like. It has made my enjoyment of the app go waaaaaay down and I am seriously considering deleting it.P.S. Im so tired of Instagram showing the notification icon for my different accounts and then there being no notification. It never goes away. Please fix this"
Wont load. Ever since the new update Instagram wont load at all. When I open the app its just a loading screen and hasnt made any improvements. I have tried with data and on WiFi and neither seem to help at all. Before the update Instagram was one of my favorite apps but now Im just irritated with it
"Awful support service - No customer care whatsoever. Im an active Instagram user and I really enjoy the app.BUTIn April my account was somehow hacked, I couldnt even log in for a while and when I eventually made it back in I found TONS of glitches that are still here todayI cannot see ANY notifications for my posts so Im missing lots of engagement, I cannot change the picture on my profile, and I cannot modify my bioIve sent TONNES of requests for technical support and help but to this day NOTHING has happened Not even a courtesy emailFor a company such as this I found their customer support really disappointing. For them their users are simply numbers And if you dont have enough followers you wont appear on their radarA true shame"
Poor messaging. Great for posting photos. Not so great for sending them to friends through private messages. Ironic isnt it?
music not available. I live in the U.S and i have 2 accounts and in one of them i can put music and hear music on stories but on my other account it wont let me hear music on another peoples stories and will only let me put music in my story if i use cellular data. Does anybody know how to fix this?
"Very disappointed. I loved Instagram, literally this the only app I use everyday but now all of a sudden I cant even open my app , I done reinstalled and tried that , Ive offloaded and deleted data , and Ive also turn my phone off and back on &amp; also I stayed off Instagram for a few days but yet my app still doesnt work Im at the point where I should give up on Instagram forever even though this how I talk to everyone"
Action block. Its been three days now and Im still action blocked just for following people and its irritating because theyre literally blocking me for using their app ???? and I have everything on my personal information that proves Im not even a bot
"New update disables direct messages. Dont update 164.0 completely disabled my access to direct messages on my personal and business account Nothing I do seems to get this functionality back (uninstalling, turning off my phone) and even logging onto Instagram on my desktop doesnt work"
"Horrible. This app is horrible if you wanna delete your account its impossible because they dont want you too so they dont let you practically, and it invades privacy. Dont get"
0 stars if I could. I say this because your system isnt safe at all. My account got hacked and its like yall dont even care. Spam reported it because its someone posting my archives and private stuffs sending messages to everyone like why? Our technology isnt perfect you got that right. Cant even feel safe on this app anymore
"account was hacked and cant seem to get any help. ive been trying to get back in my account for the last week. It got hacked, my phone number is still on that account but the person who has it turned on 2 step verification meaning i cant get back into it. I was hoping instagram can get me my account back. I had this account for months and worked hard for everything on it"
"New update. The new update is nice but a feature i am not completely satisfied is the icon that appears when youre in a chat with someone, tbh it makes me uncomfortable as i dont want someone seeing when im in chat. It puts on the pressure to reply and it goes against my privacy policy. I dont want to feel like im getting stalked and its just similar to snapchat that i dont want a replica of. Thank you for reading"
"Logged me out an deleted. Along with Facebook, Instagram had logged me out of my account and I cannot get back in. When friends go to look up my account it says that it is gone. Also when I try to login with my email and password it says sorry account cannot be found/is disabled. Apparently no one can find the issue here and I even made a new Instagram account and the app will still not allow me to login from that but I can access it from a computer"
"Pathetic. Ive used this app since 2013 and seen it get progressively worse since Facebook bought it.  This latest update with adds shopping options while tucking the familiar functions (you know, the whole POINT OF THE APP) into the upper corner as if they were an afterthought has really taken the cake.  Good job making a perfectly nice app into just another place to collect data and sell advertising space ya creeps"
Easily Hacked. Had to delete because of it. Trying to get into other personal info
"I CANNOT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT. I was randomly kicked out of my account today and whenever Im able to log in, my account is blank and says Instagram User. It wont let me verify my phone number for a code, it just says theres a problem and to try again later. And Instagram has no customer support. PLEASE help me find out what happened, I will be so upset if my account is gone"
"Love IG, But Music Issue NEEDS to be fixed. I love Instagram. Its my platform of choice. Im particularly annoyed that my account no longer has access to any music for stories or reels. Ive reached out to IG for help and would really like assistance with this. It says music is unavailable in my region, but my personal account nor pets account has this problem.  Please help. Thanks"
"Do Better. Im seriously being blocked from commenting, liking and following/unfollowing people yet again. Now I cant even log in because Im being forced to change my password as it has assumed I gave my password to a service to gain likes???? Sounds like a loss for you because despite being a photographer and using it frequently for business and personal, I am fed up.Not to mention youre not SW friendly. I guess I have better things to do and should take this as a way to cut off from social media enjoy life like they did in the good old days"
Scams. Easy to use but very easy to get your account hacked. A few of my friends and I myself had our accounts of almost 2 years hacked today in which the hacker removed our email and phone numbers so we couldnt recover our accounts. Lots of scams on the app aswell
Spying. Stop
4stars out of 5 LAG. Instagram has been super laggy lately every time I try to make a reel it kicks me out Other then that I think this is a great app to communicate with friends and family and post about your life. Just make sure not to share anything personal and parents please dont let your childern under the age of 10 get this app 
"Instagrams help center/customer service is horrible. Ive had Instagram for about six or seven years now and have no issues whatsoever until about a month ago and ongoing to now. My Instagram account was hacked and as a result of this phishing incident, Instagram temporarily locked my Instagram account. The email I signed up with, I no longer have access to, but have my Instagram password, my phone number thats linked or the account, and have many ways to prove that this is my account. Im thinking, with instagrams professional team theyll be able to help me regain access to my account very easily. Except now, its been a month later and I have still received no help from any Facebook or Instagram contact email or website. Ive loved Instagram forever and has always been a five star app for me, but the help system Instagram uses is flawed and needs tremendous work. I should be able to have my account back and Instagram should actually respond to the large amount of Instagram users like myself, who have been hacked as a result of phishing and are experiencing the same issues, with no help from such a big platform"
"Liberal cesspool. Funny how anyone can make completely baseless claims about our President but God forbid someone makes a factual claim with evidence about a Democrat. Biased beyond belief. Check their terms of service too, its a level of big brother spying like youve never seen"
eh. app was cool for looking at car builds and stuff but after my account got hacked by someone and i no longer have access to my account and said person is still useing my name and photos i kinda hate the app ( several people i know have had their account hacked in the last year)
"Profile info??. I cant update my profile info, change my picture, change name or bio. It keeps saying its an internet error but other accounts that im logged in work just fine. Its just one of them"
"Story settings wont update. I couple months ago I added another account to my IG. My business account. Ive noticed while I switch back and forth on my phone that all the updates are current on my personal IG that Ive had for many years however, with my new business account the Story settings will not update regardless of manual updates on top of automatic updates"
"Security Codes. Hello Instagram,I&#39;ve got some anonymous attempts from someone who is trying to login into my account. When I searched on the possible ways of how this person can reach any information of me, I saw an old email and phone number which neither of them is mine currently nor anymore and I felt insecure. He can send a reset security code to them.Please solve this problem and don&#39;t show any other possible information for strangers even if it&#39;s not showing the data explicitly. Also, if the person who got my old phone number wants to make an account he could easily kick me from mine and send a reset security code.Thank you"
Followers when switching from public. The people who requested to follow shouldnt be automatically followers once I switch my privacy settings
"Paul. Very disappointed with instagram, had a good run for a long while and enjoyed it. My account got hacked recently and Instagram has more or less shoved me aside and couldnt care less about my privacy being invaded "
Not Working on wifi. I have been facing this problem for more than two weeks. My Instagram is not working on wifi. I have to use mobile data or use vpn to run it. I have reported this problem several times n updated the app twice but it&#39;s still not working
"Inactive accounts issue. This app is amazing but I give it 1 star just because 1 reason, unactive accounts, I been trying to get this account name for 2 years and they are private but I requested forever ago but nothing, I tracked their followers and following and no raise but lowers and they had 10 posts when I started and 10 posts now, please do something about inactive Instagram accounts"
Awful. Terms of service is awful and a preach of privacy
Adding to my Story. I cannot add any public post to my story (of my personal account) but ai can normally do that on my business account
"my followers. I had almost 2,000 followers and when I went to go check my profile it only had 1,247 , I think this is a glitch or something bc I been made a review about this app , it keep taking my followers  , and also the people on the app is harsh. they say harsh words and threaten to do stuff to other people , and also you need to get this fixed , random people you dont know text you and ask you for your information and your personal life , and I think that is a crime. People making fake accounts to say messed up thing to other people and I dont think its right. also yall need to see about that. bc I honestly dont think its right"
"Self Video Verification. Even though I really dont like this feature because of the trust and privacy issues with Facebook. I am having trouble with submitting the self video to create and verify my new account. It keeps saying error, please try again later. This really needs to be fixed ASAP"
"apps ok but i have complaints. 1. My app is always bugging. Have updated my phone and instagram to the most recent version and I am still missing features and my app is buggingMY INSTAGRAM DMS ARE COMPLETELY BROKEN Done everything listed on the site and it wont let me use instagram dms on my main account @jordanonyango STILLthe app is also filled with spam advertisements, people who launder money, and other bad natured things"
"stillno landscape view: bye. again. every so often i forget. despite being owned now by a huge, wealthy companyfacebookthis extremely popular app gets zero resources to do a simple, no-brainer thing: landscape view, and an ipad app. its a visual app. facebook doesnt care. well, now i remember again why its not on my ipad. nor my phone, because i refuse to use an appi cant comfortably use across devices.this isnt a knock on the devs. they do a great job. its a knock on facebook"
. Its the data mining for me
Stalker much. Was a great app til it stared to track every movement. And also wouldnt let me log in
"Last update messed everything up. I maintain 4 different accounts for my personal, business and organizations I am part of. With the last update I can no longer share feed posts to stories and the app constantly has a pop up that says can not update feed. Get your act together and get this fixed"
Crap assistance. Useless help Crap removal of spam accounts And no help reporting dodgy accountsPeople being blackmailed. People having their pictures stolen and used to open fake spam bot fraud accounts
"absolutely disgusting. honestly you guys are vile, rotten scum for spying on your users. youre about to lose so many people. idiots"
Hacked account. So my account was hacked on Saturday 17 of July and both me email and phone number was changed. I message Instagram on Instagram email them and so on. but there was no action to this. The hacker is using my account to do illegal things like scamming innocent people. To what I can remember i have never bullied or say hateful comment to anyone. I live peaceful on the app for me to go through this. The app is fun but the security and privacy they promise you will never be fulfilled. They dont do say they will protect their followers. Its sad because lot of people account has been hacked but no action from Instagram. These account has stories of people lives example like people who have joined Instagram from 2 to 10 or more years but in just a day their account was hacked and the only person they believe will help them and guarantee their safety let them down and turn their back on this. And still there is no help for me to regain my account 
Ive always loved this app. Thank you for all of the saved memories and improvements. Always loved instagram. This app was my first social media and will always be my most loved. Incredible add and its helped me advertise my YouTube videos Thanks for everything and look forward to continuing to use it
Disabled account. I was reported for pretending to be someone else and instagram disabled my account when Ive had my personal account for years. When I try to follow there appeal process they also havent been responding to the appeal process
"Once again. As long as there is a suggested feed in MY PERSONAL FEED I will continue to give this poor reviews. That is what explore is for, which I hardly use anyway because I want to look at the things I HAVE CHOSEN. I am not talking about ads, while I dont like them I understand them"
Cannot use the app. Ive been logged out of my account and cannot access the app what so ever. Dont know what the hell to do and cant find any form of contact to you. This is a really really bad time as Ive got a wedding today wohooo thanks a lot Instagram. Ruining my entire day from this morning. Not even worth one star
"Dangerous. Lost years of my life because of this app. Its algorithm is designed to keep you engaged, at all costs. It will show you exactly what you dont want to see. That way they can ensure youre angry and stuck on the phone all day. The way the ops works is like a lot machine. Scrolling all day waiting for something new. Bad for your mental health and has caused thousands of personal crisis for people and business.. its a horrible app"
"Story Glitch. I have reported the same issue at least two dozen times and have not received a response or any adjustments to the app. I know that a number of my followers have complained about the exact same issue. I am frustrated with the lack of responsiveness to what seems like an easy glitch to fix. When I and many others go to share a post to my story, I am only able to send things directly to users. I have checked my privacy settings, redownloaded the app, &amp; followed all of the online instructions... I will not be happy with Instagram until this issue which I have dealt with for over two years is fixed"
"Suggested friends. Can we please take away the suggested friends on your own personal profile view? Its so distracting especially when I want to see my profile picture, highlights and feed all at once to make sure the theme is consistent.  Move the suggested friends somewhere else this is terrible "
"maintenance. keeps on saying no data, couldnt refresh, needs to be fixed guys"
"New update is terrible, change it back. The fact that the main buttons on the app are for reels and shopping is just ridiculous. I open Instagram to post pictures to share with friends and family, not to shop and post reels. The shopping tab replacing the notifications tab is just even more ridiculous because the whole point of Instagram is to share pictures. Why is a main functioning part of the apps purpose being moved aside for a shopping tab?? I hate the direction this app is going because the algorithm revolves around ads and influencers to sell those ads...I dont even see posts from my friends anymore, everything is all about shopping and reels"
legal removal request. i have emailed everyone i possibly can find i simply want all my information taken off your server it&#39;s not asking much seriously all the accounts created were not even done by me seriously just deleted my shit man so simple it&#39;s my privacy my information there is an unknown admin i don&#39;t socialize with anyone at all i want it deleted you have had no respect my mother does not know what to do and i have a year life expectancy delete it please delete it man
"Story Issues. IG stories recently stopped showing me the viewers count , even showing that no one has viewed my story when in fact users have messaged me about my story. This is a lie & IG is not showing true data"
"NO NOTIFICATIONS TAB. I dont know if its just me, but I find the new update extremely annoying. Why did Instagram get rid of the easy access notifications tab on the bottom of the screen?? Why change it after all this time into a shopping tab? It is so much more complicated and inconvenient to have to go to my profile first to access my notifications. Instagram is firstly a platform to interact with your friends/followers, NOT a shopping platform"
"Instagram has some problems. Igtv always takes a while to load, the video starts playing and stops every 3 seconds therefore i have to go on and off instagram just to reload the video. Furthermore I had two Instagram accounts , one personal and one business account that I linked to my personal account using the multi login function, unaware that I would never be allowed to log in to my business account alone unless I was logged into my personal one. One day I logged out of instagram and logged back in 4 days later and my business account didnt link automatically which it was supposed to. Seeing as Instagram didnt let me log into my business account with the same password it just kept telling me that the username is incorrect even though I was still able to view my business account when searching it up on my personal Instagram ( it was the same username ??). This was upsetting because I had built my client base on that business account and had to start afresh"
Do better. My page has been blocked from a-lot of pages on almost every page I visit I cant even leave a comment it says these comments have been limited but the another person sitting right beside me could go to that same page an it gives them the option to leave a comment I also mysteriously lose followers even if they personally didnt unfollow me Instagram need to do better with blocking people page from being seen all because of personal reasons do better Instagram. Its time you change the way you handle things that you dont believe in. This world need change so fix that thanks an be Blessed.
Flaw. I have a old hacked account from almost 2 years ago I logged into today and it wont let me delete it off my phone I deleted Insta and re downloaded it 4 times still wont disappear also Instagram still hasnt deleted the account its been reported multiple times so I dont know what yalls doing so I guess I will go without Instagram
Spys. These idiots have been spying on you with your front camera for ages they got sued for it but still
"VPN loading issues. The app is as solid as always however use over a VPN is almost impossible, the app just wont load/refresh data. We shouldnt have to compromise our privacy and security to view and post photos. Please fix this issue so we can use this app over a VPN"
HACKER AND INSTAGRAM HAS DONE NOTHING TO HELP ME GET MY ACCOUNT BACK. Instagram is horrible when it comes to securing and privacy I was hacked and Instagram still has my hacked logged in. Its sad its no support for this and they take hours to respond this is sick. Ans then everytime I try and change my password its gives error: use a password you never used before when I keep doing that exact same thing
Account hack. My niece just informed me that someone has opened an account using my name and pictures. I cant figure out how to report it and get it shut down. Please help me  They are sending private messages to people
Update issue. It wont let me change my account to a personal private one from business and Ive tried everything and reported it many times. I dont get notifications and its not my phone settings
"Selling out. I still see all of my normal posts and friends, but I feel there is a bigger focus on trying to sell merchandise. Every 5th post is a sponsored ad and often some of the famous or verified users are also selling out to put ads on your feed. Dont even get me started on all the spam sent to my messages"
HACKING. Hey there are hackers up here talking about look at these ugly pics that someone did of u and there is a link and it saying that u have one a I phone 11 pro max  and then there is just like u have to download all the things then I will get the phone and it just is getting younger kids to download all these apps and people are having to make new accounts case of that YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS NOW
Using data a lot and etc. This app have lots of bugsso please fix them
I feel so good But its zapping my data. Zapping my data but its kinda good
Locked out. I cant log into my Instagram account. When I try to do the second part of recovery nothing comes. They changed email and phone number Can you help me? Im not happy being locked out It's saying I have a connection problem when I'm trying to do they second part of the recovery when I have no problem. Fix that you cant recover your account because someone changed your email. Im trying to recover but it is sending the recovery info to the person who stole my account and changed the contact information. I want it sent to me instead
DO NOT UPDATE. Every since the new update I cant share other peoples post to my story or cant highlight stories to my personal page
No one responds. I recently had to get a new phone and was locked out of my Instagram. For some reason the email reset wasnt working but I only have one email so I must have been hacked. I tried dozens and dozens of times through every avenue to reach out to Instagram for help and not a single response ever came. Very very disappointed
"Big problems with new updates. Used this app for years, have always loved it. Lately though Im starting to wonder why Im even on it. Ive 3 profiles, one personal life, one work and one a hobby. The new update simply switches between these profiles at random, Ive read it on a lot of post so its not just me. Secondly adding multiple pictures is difficult seens as it allows the first image to be the typical size and format and then every image onwards to be added in a weird distorted/shrunk format that cuts of half of the picture. Too many adds, algorithm is difficult to keep up with. This app expects ALOT of your time in order to give you a little exposure. I can find myself deleting my accounts soon like many others profiles Im seeing"
"Please change reverse this garbage update. Dont usually leave reviews but the suggested posts feature on my personal newsfeed is honestly awful, inconvenient, and plain stupid. Please reverse it - this app has been downgrading for a long time and this is the final straw for me :("
My accounts been hacked and Ive had no help recovering. Some Nigerian hacked me changed the phone number and email so I cant recover and I cant even reach Instagram for assistance
Upset. Ive been a long time Instagram user. However Im upset at the fact I cannot play music on my stories which would be great for my personal and business page I have on here. Also this is very small but I cannot due the Disney filter. I check to see if I need an update but it has already been updated. Im just not getting features that other users are getting and I find that unfair. Can someone at Instagram please fix this
"I have a problem, please help me. I can't see the activity status of people in the conversation even though I have this feature turned off on my accountBut I can see their activity status when I use the browserKnowing that I am updating the application permanently and tried to log out and log in again and I also deleted the application and deleted the application data from the device and I could not solve the problem"
"Favorite app. Everyone has personal pictures, memories on their phones now a days. This tool give us the ability to see the best and worse parts of ourselves, stay connected and accepted while tracking your own story. History is important and that includes you, who you are and present yourself to be. Awesome app, 10/10 would use it almost everyday if not everyday. And especially to track my own progress as well as others"
"Please fix these stupid issues. Im sick and tired of these issues. Instagram you need to get it together, Im having major problems with instagram because I cant even log in to any of my accounts anymore. I have to switch back and forth from my personal to other accounts, when I try to log in all it says is Error, please wait a few more minutes before you try again. Its been like this for 2 weeks and Im tired of it. I would greatly appreciate if you could fix these problems and other problems because I could name a million more"
Im not a happy camper. Someone made an account impersonating me. I have reported over 50 times. Even filed a report &amp; had to prove who I was with a picture ID... test its still active They are sending messages to friends &amp; trying to get their personal information
"Great app for  video calling and communication. I have a problem, overall the app is my favourite it also takes less data. I use it all the time, i downloaded it 4 months ago yet it only took not even 1GB But i have an issue: On my second proffesional account, the add yours  sticker is not coming on my iPad. And its so blurry when i click the add yours on someoness story. Same with my iPhone, please fix Thats why i removed a star :( Anyways app is great Totally recommend, Free,entertaining and less storage. :D"
"First ever account locked immediately. First time ever creating an account. Account locked upon creation (I have never even logged in) because of suspicious activity, I assume because I use a VPN. Please wait 24 hours so we can verify your information. Give me a break. Tech companies need to get with it and simply accept that people no longer wish to be tracked relentlessly and will be employing measures such as VPNs. If your system cant handle that without breaking, then its a crappy system"
"Bug. I cant share feeds to my stories, it works on some accounts but now my personal one please help"
Terrible app. Gathers your data and sells it on
"I love Instagram but it could be SO much better. Please make it so that I can see everyones likes again I dont understand why you only disabled them for some people but then left them for the rest. I just made a new account and I can see everyones likes whereas, on my personal page, I cant. I understand the point but its super bothersome and Id really just like them back. Also pLEASE change the feed to chronological order...all I see are posts from the TWO meme pages I follow instead of the people that I actually know. Crazy. Please fix your algorithm and bring back the likes, I would be forever grateful"
Disappointed. My account was hacked and you have not helped me get it back then you locked me out of my we account citing community guidelines YET my other account was hacked and she is using my image to sell stuff and you dont punish her or give me back my account or the new account Terrible
get ur info straight. on the app. it says that u have to be 12 or plus . yet my account got taken away for some confusion bc im under thirteen. when i stated i just turned 13 a few months agos. GET UR FREAKING FACTS STRAIGHT
"Account Disabled for Connecting with Friends. My Instagram account was disabled because I sent DMs to my online friends asking if I could send them Christmas presents, which according to Instagrams faulty algorithim, makes me worthy of being taken down, while their app claims to want to foster genuine community and connection.During COVID, e-mail and e-gifts are some of the only ways to connect with others, and their bot cant tell the difference. Ive sent two support tickets with pictures to Instagram, and have received no response, all during the season when were already so isolated. Instagram was one of the best ways for me to keep in touch with friends and family, and now Ive lost all of that. Instagram has no customer support and no way to speak to an actual person, even through live chat or e-text. Ive never written an Apple review before, but  I cant get through to Instagram or Facebook Support (as I only have a personal account on Instagram, no Facebook and no Facebook Business account to access support chat) and am hoping that Apple sees this and can offer some help or next steps to recover my account"
"Porn for 12 yr olds. I use the app for personal and business use.. its very beneficial. But the app rating says 12+ for the age. Joke. Because I am a male, my explore feed is littered with pornographic imagery. This app gets kids used to seeing near naked and sometimes naked bodies, to see women as objects instead of people. This app is mentally abusing their own minds and in term they are abusing others others around them with sick words and sexual comments, because of Instagram. Its sickening. Disgusting. Whats really upsetting is how little is being done about it"
Help. My account has been hacked and there is seemingly nothing I can do to reach out to Instagram and ask for help. I cant do a reset because my email and number info were changed. Please let me know how to reach Instagram or fix this issue asap
HIGHLIGHTS. i hate instagram so much theres no point in it anymore. YOU CANT SAVE PICTURES TO UR HIGHLIGHTS??????? excuse me so what am i supposed to do now this is so stupid must be fixed or ill delete the app
"Bro whats up with this app??. Ok, Im a artist who just wants to share my stupid fan art I have like 3 acc 1. My art acc 2. My personal 3. My backup. On my art acc its features are updated but not on my personal or backup? The way my dms have its own button on the bottom and to get to explore page u jusst swipe, but on my personal it doesnt do that :( its just the old way of doing it. I think yall should go fix it Let ya girl have her updates"
"Instagram is TOXIC... do not use it. Instagram in my opinion is a toxic place. People say its good but the truth of the matter is it isnt.I myself had personal issues with it and I will never be back here again.PS. Find a way to put the weirdos in a spam request folder without them showing up under request to follow you, because Im sure Im not the only one whos received follower requests from weirdos in the past"
"Suggested Posts on Home Page. Please take the suggested posts off of my personal feed. If I wanted to follow those people or see their posts, I would look them up first. My feed should not be another explore page. It is distracting and minimizes my ability to connect with loved ones but rather look at influncers pages. It is unhealthy. Please take it off. Thanks"
Trash. A garbage app with no respect for your privacy or your time
Uses Microphone Even When Disabled in Privacy Settings. 1 STARThis app uses the microphone even when the microphone is disabled in privacy settings. This is a breach of my rights
Cannot open instagram. I was messing with my settings and accidentally pressed reset privacy settings and now it says instagram is unable to open and i need to accept location and stuff which i have done but this continuously fails. i have no idea what to do
"4.5. More like 4.5 still, thanks for an awesome app. The psychopaths and stalkers could have a few better privacy buttons yet thanks anyway"
"Awful app. Instagram has in recent years, really become awful. I cant hashtag any of my pictures because its spam, but theres a plethora of spam sex bots that are on here day by day that they do nothing about. I cant even grow so whats the point? Tik tok is a much better app to try to grow organically"
"Improvements. Yall need to fix the stories because some peoples stories keep popping up as if I never looked at them. Whatever formula Twitter used to get rid of horny bots is what yall need to use because I havent seen them on Twitter in months. Yall just kept letting these bots evolve for nearly two years, and its getting out of hand. I would like it if the sound wasnt automatically on every time I enter the app and was off like I always have it before I exit the app. Yall should let us post stuff at whatever size we want or at least make the frame a couple inches bigger because zooming out pictures for a full size still isnt enough. You guys should let us turn off notifications in-app. I already turned off the notifications for my phone, but Im getting annoyed with some people who like to go live a lot in one day and constantly having to see notifications for them popping up. I dont wanna unfollow them since I like their content, but ugghhh. Yall should remove the See More Posts Like This tab, too because thats annoying to see every time I click on a post on the Explore feed"
Posting to Instagram Stories. I have been unable to post anyones posts or stories to my own personal story. I have talked with other people who have accounts and they said they have similar issues. Why are only a few of your accounts able to do it while the rest are not? I dont even have an option to ever post anything to my story except for IGTV videos
"Account hacked. Hi Instagram staff, I hope youre well. I couldnt recover my account using the phone number, email or username in the get help signing in since all this information had been changed by the hackers. Im  willing to follow the steps necessary to recover my account. Please help"
Not letting me change any information. I am unable to change any of my personal information even though I got hacked
"Horrible. This app will give you a temporary unfollowing/BLOCKING ban which is a massive breach of privacy, if you want to ban multiple people for your own safety or privacy for one reason or another it will literally ban you from doing so and give you a huge time within that you arent allowed to get rid of people within. This is disgusting and shouldnt be allowed"
Its good but just one thing. I love the app of course but why did yall get rid of the activity log? Cause I want to see whats going on with certain things for personal reasons (nothing bad). Other than that its good
"Therapy for anxiety. I have suffer from anxiety for half of my life. As an adult it has been difficult to overcome. With Instagram I can express myself in safety, comfort and control. It has allowed me to branch out and stretch my personal horizon, reattach to missed loved ones and find a new life in art after all these years Thank you for the opportunity:)"
"A Dying App. Really disappointed with the way this app is headed. The way its filtered out all my personal friends from my feed and replaced them with the meme pages and celebrities i follow. I had to unfollow those pages just to see my friends posts. This app just promotes money making ways, its no longer a place for creatives or for everyday people to connect with long lost friends/family or share things that make us happy. Truly this app has downgraded so much that I use VSCO instead"
Music sticker not available on my 3rd account. I have 3 IG accounts. 2 personal and one business. One account will not allow me to put music on my IG story and Im unsure why when the other pages have it??? Can someone assist meThank you
"DEACTIVATED MY ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON AND NO WAY TO APPEAL. I am horrified with Instagrams user support. They do not care about their users. They deactivated my personal account of 6years for no reason at all. When I tried to appeal this decision, it requires me to LOG-IN to my account to confirm its me, but they have locked me out of my account so how can I? There is no one to contact for help They sent me a link to download my data so I at least wouldnt lose my photos, BUT THE LINK WAS BROKEN. Their appeals process is broken and it leaves users with nothing. I know there are many others who have experienced my issue. Please do something about this Instagram. It is truly appalling"
Professional accounts cant find relevant music. Every update its never fixed. I get frustrated making stories for my professional account bc I can never find any snoop dog or Beyoncé to put on the background of my videos. I emailed support 50 billion times. It works perfectly fine on my personal account. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG
Horrible service. Garbage app that steals your info
"IGTV Support. Each time Ive uploaded to IGTV Ive been hit with SEVERELY slow upload speeds. Even when an industry level computer on the highest wifi speed I have access to. But uploading from my phone on my data plan beats that??? I know video support is hard, I think its a miracle IGTV even supports 3GB uploads (at the time of this post). But please do something about the upload times. And for the love of god let us change the cover photos for IGTV posts. My feed looks so random now . I want to be able to go back and change cover photos to keep my profile style in tact"
"why cant i get into my account???. everything is white and im unable to access my profile, my feed says it cannot load, and i cant log in without having to confirm my phone number which doesnt even send a code. FIX IT PLEASE"
Instagram verification. I have tried to get my Instagram verified after being hacked at 12.3k @jetgang but they have not accepted my last two request to verify @jetgangs my new account since I was hacked Ive sent a picture of my id and they still havent verified my account
"Popular, But Monopolizing. If I send a picture, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT. I can see it sent, was opened, and can unsend it. Why can I not reevaluate what I already sent? MY property? This OVER STEPS THE BOUNDS OF PRIVACY. This app is definitely not Boomer friendly. Its barely friendly to my generation. Which is X, btw. Cater to consumers and their privacy, you outdated old white men"
"I need help. Hey Instagram I deleted and re downloaded your app and logged into my account but it seems to kick me out every time I click on it?, do you know any solutions?"
"Who ever did this update. Suggested post should stay on the explore page not my Personal IG timeline. My timeline is now FLOODED with post Im not remotely even interested in and I cant see ANY post from people Im following. The explore contents shouldnt spill over to personal timelines. No most yet how far down I scroll its all suggestions, all of it. Where are my friends posts??"
"Cant send messages. For the past few months, I havent been able to send messages to people on this app unless they text me first and I havent violated anyones privacy on Instagram. Ive reported it so many times yet still the same thing. I hope this is fixed ASAP"
"Please help me. I have Instagram since I was little it had been working well since last year I had change my password from another phone cause I was using my bestfriend so when I got home I was trying to loggin and the password was right  and everything but when I press login it told please try later and I was like okay fine.

Love & hate. I absolutely love this app for my personal account - it always works As for my business account everytime I try to post images they get instantly deleted everytime.  Its annoying and bad for my business account
If you wanna take down false information at least stick to it you arses. might as well take down pro israeli pages and posts down Ive seen an abundance of false info. on most. #savepalestine
help me please. I can't see the activity status of people in the conversation even though I have this feature turned off on my account But I can see their activity status when I use the browser Knowing that I am updating the application permanently and tried to log out and log in again and I also deleted the application and deleted the application data from the device and I could not solve the problem
"I do not support this app anymore. I can no longer scroll through my home page and look at the posts of people I have followed. When I  catch up I am forced to click into a separate window for older posts, and my feed under that is filled with suggested posts that are 100% advertisements. There is already a place for suggested posts in the search tab, and I will go there if I want to look at memes. I dont want my personal feed to be out of my control in this way. Please stop forcing your suggestions down my throat. As much as I want to see what my friends and favorite creators are up to, I will not be using this until I can continuously scroll through the posts I curated when on my own home feed"
Privacy Concern. Your privacy is getting better on last updateOn search tap on accounts remove SUGGESTEDAlso tap on following Remove SUGGESTED FOR YOUMiddle of the page also there SUGGESTED FOR YOURemove please
"many issues. first of all, i havent been receiving message notifications since summer 2020. the issue isnt with my phone or with my notification settings, its with the app itself. ive reported this issue several times since then, but instagram has done nothing to fix it. second of all, i havent been able to post videos for days now. i even tried posting a post that had 5 pictures and 1 video, but it still wouldnt post. some of my friends have been having this issue too. please fix this"
"Notification hell. Keep sending spam notifications like « Xxxx has posted a photo », even if you opt out from these notifications"
Hacked. My personal acct has been HS led four times from Russia. I only had maybe 80 followers every time I open Instagram it tells me I have to login again. Never had a problem before
Suggested posts in main feed is unacceptable. Showing &#34;Suggested&#34; posts in the main feed instead of people I follow is unacceptable. App is now suggested posts and ads. Chronological order was taken away ago. Can&#39;t disable Reels. Privacy policy terrible.  App is no longer enjoyable - time to delete
PLEASE BE CAREFUL INSTAGRAM. Hey Instagram so Ive been on Instagram for a while and I found out that someone has been trying to hack my acc and you gave me a warning which I didnt do you said Ive been using apps to get more followers when I havent please check twice before doing anything because I have not downloaded or shared my password
"I have problem. I have a big problem   I have my business account and at the beginning I could put music in my stories ... about 4 months ago I could not put music in my stories in my personal account, yes, but in the business account, no   I have written to the inatagram and they never answer me   who can help me thanks"
Disappointed. Im really disappointed with Instagram algorithms. Its not pushing data and suddenly follower increases and decreases
There is no messenger option available for my account :(. Hi I realised all my friends have the new updated messenger connected to their instagram dm but I dont have it.

Yes I have checked my account security and access data it says there is no date shown for messenger :(  WHY CANT I HAVE THE SAME INSTAGRAM EXPERIENCE AS EVERYONE ELSE I WANT TO ACCESS THE UPDATE SO I CAN REACT TO MESSAGES. THAT IS DISCRIMINATION. I AM ABOUT TO DELETE INSTAGRAM FED UP NOW. PLEASE REPLY AND HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. Thank you
"App crash and say I don t have internet. I dont know what happens lately but the Instagram app doesnt work proper anymore. I do have internet all the time on my phone, data &amp; WiFi but still this app is the only one who say I dont have internet and is not working.i even contact my network provider but seems is an Instagram issue. Sometimes, for 2 minutes is working, and then the signal for Instagram just disappears. Try to report on their website from my laptop but they don t have any live support or even I cannot creat an issue.very disappointing"
"Wish they would help. I wish instagram had a way to contact its support team I have no access to my old Email associated with my instagram account, and when I log in its says suspicious login... its me but I cant do anything without access to my email that was created ages ago"
Read pls. Do you think there could be a feature to delete others messages because sometimes people message others who are like 11 12 13 with strict parents that want to have some privacy from there parents and sometimes there friends spill important stuff threw Instagram that the dont want their parents knowing
Thank you. For protecting my privacy
"Terrible Customer Service. Weeks ago I had my account hacked by people in Russia, which Instagram did not clue me into at all. But once I noticed it I booted them off and tried to report it. Then just last week Instagram deactivated my account. I have gone through all the hoops to reactivate my account, sent them about 5 mug shots with codes to try to prove I am who I am, and have gotten no response from them at all. Just automated emails when you complete their form that leads to nowhere. I have heard of many people who are following community guidelines but get hacked and have their account deactivated. I will have lost all my connections, all my pictures, comments, and memories from almost 10 years. They should be ashamed of their customer service. They didnt help me at all when my account was hacked and now they just ripped my account away from me. They think they can get away with it because everyones on Instagram and theyre untouchable"
"Music. Ive been using Instagram since 2014-2015 and normally I dont have an issue BUT this latest update stopped the story music function from working on all my accounts. Its so frustrating especially when Im trying to create content. Ive tried updating the app, logging out, logging back in, switching from a personal page to business and back, etc etc. and nothing. Seriously fix this issue, Im seeing videos everywhere saying this is happening frequently now"
Used to be better. Would be great if they could figure out a way to get rid of the spam group messages
"I have problem. I have a big problem   I have my business account and at the beginning I could put music in my stories ... about 7 months ago I could not put music in my stories in my personal account, yes, but in the business account, no   I have written to the inatagram and they never answer me   who can help me thanks"
"No Support. The button to repost a post on my story has been removed on my personal and business account. I have another page I dont use anymore and it allows me to repost a post on that account. I have checked all settings , everything is exactly the same. I have emailed and messaged Instagram about this issue and no response back"
"Horrible Customer Service. Ive been trying to contact Instagram for 6 months because I am not able to make or see reels on my professional account while I can see them on my personal account. Seeing as reels seem to make a big impact on your exposure to potential new followers, I am very frustrated. Ive received absolutely no responses to any of my reports. Incredibly disappointing Instagram. My handle is @kyla.marie.w"
"I was hacked, please find a solution. Dear developers or readers, my instagram account was just hacked from someone else's instagram account which I'm assuming was also hacked. I cannot get back into my account anymore because the recovery email and password of my account were changed as soon as they got in. So developers, please make main recovery via phone or make it easy to go around this issue and recover accounts. I am very unhappy right now"
Theifs. This app stole my account it logged me out and sent a code to a email I did not put I tried everything and no Im not hacked all I have access to Is changing my password
"Falsely accusing. Im not so sure why 2014 picture that far-away from nudity comes out today if it was Nud and violated ur ego why today after 7 years? Instagram u r fraud delinquent, Im too old for ur false accusations nor into such 3 days consecutive u torment me with ur false community violention and I refuse to follow ur pushed sexual accounts not into it and I have the right to block such accounts. And you sold my information many time to ur advertisers and u have bank credit card that I never know about it it come on be better you desperate do not backtrack not sell my information do not open credit card under my name. Will reporting u to appropriate authorities. Be better dont falsely accuse people u got wrong person to mess with"
"New update. Ever since the new update (which I got today) Instagram wont let me message people back. But I can receive messages. I can do anything else but message people. Ive tried restarting my phone, checking my WiFi and data, logging out of my account and deleting Instagram/ restarting my phone. But once I got it back it just shows it loading (when I go to dms) so I swipe and after a minute itll say there was an issue even though I have full bars. Instagram please fix this"
"Blocked for trying to unfollowing people. I downloaded an app to unfollow people but instead Instagram blocked me from doing anything and says I downloaded an app to boost my followers  wow.. not my type of crap to want to do. I even wrote to them saying why dont you guys implement that you feature yourself if you dont want people to download an app to unfollow people that are not following you back. Clearly thats a feature that would work for them but instead Ive been blocked for almost 2weeks now as if I even care to use that app like that, I cant even unfollow anyone from the app. Time to delete this crap all in one since I dont have the personal right to like anything at the moment or unfollow anyone. No personal choices with these apps anymore not sure there ever was. Crap like this turns people off from wanting to uses your stuff, its not as if I do weird things or show nude or anything stupid on my profile but Im blocked ooh well just had to say my lil piece. Thanks now Ill just go continue working on my own apps dont care how far you guys have made it this crap for blocking me"
. I like instagram a lot but I dont know why my notifications havent been working and they are turned on in my phone and on the app and I only get notifications when I am using the app and sometimes not even until I refresh my page I shows up like what is wrong can you fix it please cause its annoying
"thanks for providing your info. im getting more and more upsetting with instagram. first, i was logged out of my old account and spent hours trying to log back in and get access to it but then i gave up and made a new account. NOW, its giving me a Thank for providing your info notice? are you kidding me? I did absolutely nothing and now I have to deal with these now. I am so irritated Please fix this It was working perfectly fine today and now it randomly popped up when I opened instagram to post on my story"
First week of Instagram thoughts. So far I like it although I&#39;ve been on Facebook and I have a lunch of a groups and been on Twitter for a long time But with an iPhone 12 and great signals and both Wi-Fi data all I get is the red error at the bottom every time I go to scroll through the rails or open it up sorry something went wrong try again or upgrade I have the latest update so what&#39;s the deal with that
"Fix your support team. (Ignore my punctuation mistakes)I recently forgot the password to my phone. I had to restore it, because of that I lost access to my accounts because on my phone I had a two factor authentication app and screenshot of my backup codes. Unfortunately, now I am unable to access both. I tried everything I can to try log in, but I couldnt. So because of that I had to request support. The first time I did they replied asking me to verify my identity so I did, then they replied saying my two factor authentication should be off. When I tried to log in, it does not work because the two factor authentication is still on So I had to reply saying that its not off, and all that they ended up not replying. I gave it some time then I requested again, the same thing happened they asked me to verify my identity in a different way, and I did they replied saying my two factor authentication should be off, but when I log in its NOT off. I requested support again same thing happened they replied saying its off, when in fact its not and then I requested support using a different contact email &amp; they did not even reply. Ps I know the passwords to my accounts. *So Facebook/Instagram if you are seeing this fix my problem, please.*"
I LOVE IT but somethings wrong. OMG I LOVE INSTAGRAM and the updates they make which have new features Instagram has definstley upgraded since it first came out now with chat themes and u can even block people from comments and allow some people its so cool but theres one thing I hate when ur on a laptop u can see how many people liked your photo by just hovering over it please fix for privacy issues
"Continuous problems in my business account. First every time I need to promote and create an add I need to remove the app then reloaded it from App Store, its really frustrating. And recently I cant access music library on Instagram business anymore to add any music to my stories, by the way it was working before they but suddenly stopped.I really need professional support to fix my business account specially its linked to my personal one , however the personal one is working efficiently"
Intentionally horrible mobile browser experience. Intentionally horrible mobile browser experience to force you to get their app which collects more data about you for sale to advertisers
Support Help Never Replies. I have been sending countless help messages for over 6 months within Instagram to fix a feature that is not showing up on my account. My allow resharing to stories in the settings/privacy/story/sharing/ area is not there. The slider enable or disable is not there as well.I have asked them to re-enable this feature on my Instagram account dabossofross to no avail
"Fix it. I love Instagram I have 3 accounts that is one my personal, an animal Jam one and a fan account. But its been 3 days since I cant post any videos. I can post pictures but no videos I thought it was due to copyright but its not so can you please fix this bug"
"horrible. I have 2 accounts, one public art account and a personal one. After being on my personal one for a day or two, I tried switching back into my art account. When I clicked it, it said that my account had been disabled. I only had 5 things posted, and they were all artwork of scenery with no inappropriate content or anything that violates instagram guidelines. It then told me the only way I could get it fixed was to type in my phone number and get a verification code. I typed in my phone number, and waited patiently for a verification code. After 2 hours, no code had been sent. I tried again and again and no code was sent. That was the only way I could get my account un-disabled. If I could rate this 0 stars I would. I had invested so much time and work into that account. Im truly disappointed in instagram and their help center. They need to have a phone number or call number where you can actually communicate and find out whats wrong with your account"
"Help needed. I have been trying in every way to contact fb support. My Apple ID was hacked and because I wouldnt give them money they went on my fb and posted something that was classed as a severe violation and my account was disabled. The hacker doesnt have access as I fixed that as soon as they logged in cause I got notification of a unknown device accessing. But the damage was done I have tried everything to try to contact you - fb. Everything It took a week before I could even submit a disagreeance with my account being disabled (and I found this through a 3rd party as your help centre link wouldnt work) but only could give my login and driver lic when it finally was available at login but couldnt even put a not to say I was hacked so they could review my case. And now a week has past since I disagreed and still nothing. 2 weeks since I was disabled and nothing And in 2 weeks my account is gone for good. Please help My business is sitting dormant, I cant reply to any client who messages, I cant run paid healing events.. nothing, my messenger is gone, my fb gone, my insta gone, that alone all my memories and all the memories I shared with everyone else, even my kids birth. 14 years gone and I cant get any help. I have a book publication this week and cant access the publication groups. I really need help. I deserve some help and for my appeal to be reviewed, please. Even app support on here has no direct contact Sadly I have been searching the net trying to find a way to get help and I have read so many similar stories of hackers posting something and disabling the accounts. Id like my account to be fairly reviewed and you will see I have not ever even been jailed for a day And fb can see a unknown device accessing minutes before my violation. I have tried all the avenues you offered to resolve this. I even had a new account to try to contact you as my help centre function are limited. But you deactivated that account as being a duplicate. It was only there so I could contact you Please help. 5 stars to me for trying everything possible. I would greatly appreciate help. Please help. Thanks Kelli Hurley"
The auto play videos and adds. The auto play videos and ads are killing my data
Ive been hacked. Ive been hacked and all my IG friends and and family have been reported in the profile and its still happening this happened yesterday May 20 and you guys have done nothing about it because this person still has all my information and nothing has been deleted. Please shut her out please take my profile away from her and do not let her get back into it. My profile that was hacked is __.mrsrivass82
"Wat bothers me. The endless spammy spam.  The hacks   I understand nothing is free, and u need advertising.  Some of that needs more security"
Data. Too expensive  data in South Africa
Too many ads. Too many ads. Follows you everywhere with ads with super cookies. Doesnt respect privacy. Kills kids via mental health
Personal problem. I cant change my profile picture it say I dont have internet but I do and Ive tried so many things to change it so this is last one please help.Thankyou
"Account Probems. I have two accounts and Instagram will not allow access to my second account. I login and it acts like it logs in but doesnt. Ive sent several help requests with no response. I have t been able to sing into my second account for months. The login info I put in is correct, Ive changed my password a few times to make sure. Still doesnt work"
"Add privacy. If you guys add this feature, Ill change my review to a 5 star. You need to add a feature where you can hide your following list from being viewed and not show others if youve liked someones post. I would like more privacy on your platform please"
"Disappointed. My Instagram account was hacked in March and I have tried and tried to get in touch with Instagram to help me out and there was no communication. I had over 40k followers, I have lost access to it. Also in my new account I dont have the reply feature in the DMs"
Business page. REALLY WISH MY BUSINESS PAGE WOULD GET THE NEW FEATURES My IG business does not have music or new fonts. How does this help a small business engage? I love IG. But my personal has all the cool new stuff and my business page has nothing cool. Please fix this. 
Video quality. Video quality continues to look compressed on an account. Provided feedback multiple times and no response. Device is an iPhone 12 Pro Max with primarily 5G access and data saver was never turned on. Experience is not enjoyable especially on reels
Help user regain old accounts that may forget password /emails but really know there user name. I wish I could get help or contact someone that work for Instagram because no I do not remember my old password to my old Instagrams but I do remember user name if I remember back then through Facebook when lose the phone password use can select photos of friends and match them to names in order to get back into the account.Or like I said I have picture proof to prove my identity to maybe or possibly get back my accounts one day I would like to know is there anyway that I can please get help.one last thing I would like to be able to remove any account info that I cannot remember password to like an email an be able to create new one in seconds.Because Im already in one account just cant remember that info.pls help me.I would like to know why dont you all ask security questions or identify insta friend Facebook something like this to get back into your account if having difficulty not just phone and email I rlly need help for like 2 or 3 account every last one has my legit photos I would like to just know what can we do
"Crushing creators in a money grab. IG was fun before FB bought it out and ruined it like everything else they touch. First they steal ideas from snap, then TikTok? Once they put the shop button on, I left. Its poor user interface and suppression of creators killed a once great app. And dont even get me started on them literally spying on you through ur camera. "
Great but. Ive had IG for a while now with no issues then the other day I got hacked and its a nightmare to sort out so I had to create a new account which is upsetting because I cant get those photos back from years ago. The process for recovering a hacked account should be revamped and it would be wonderful if a real person was available to help walk you through fixing the hack. Or if they could just up their privacy so hacking is less likely
Tried to love it but I cannot. I tried to love it since it updated later last year. I hate the change of layouts(with adding of reels and shopping). It is suppose to be a app for photo editing and sharing specifically. If I want to watch short video why dont I use tiktok. But why...... I do not enjoy using the reels and they put the original post bottom replaced with reels. This is just incredible awful. Also there are so many bugs with background music and videos. Why Instagram just cannot be like Instagram?
Careful. They will spy on you without your permission
"Help. My Instagram is not working. Ill delete it then get it again and it works for the first time I open it but when I open it again the search is just black, I cant refresh the feed, and my DMs only let me send stuff. Im connected to Wifi and Data, and worked until I had to delete the app and get it again. Now it wont work"
"Do app developers even respond. So I keep track of my kids Instagram. She has recently hacked. I forgot her password, I am trying to change it and its refusing to let me. Fix this please"
"Full of spam. Incredible how they still havent implemented spam filters for comments and message requests. Clearly they dont care that they are taken down. I get upwards of 5 message requests a day from spam accounts, there seems to be no checks enforced. A message containing a link from someone that I dont follow in a group chat with 20 people? Seems legitHonestly, spam detection is literally Machine Learning 101 and this app has clearly no intention to filter out the spam"
Ugh. They wont even help fix any problems you have with their app. I reached out to them about how I cant access my saved list on my personal account and it still isnt fixed
Notification. Please make an update so that you receive a notification when someone shares your post in a story even when they dont tag your name so we can keep track of who is sharing our workThank youH
Problems. I have set up another account to have for business and it keep showing challenge_required. I can sometime get onto my personal account but its iffy. Cant contact Instagram and have tried everything.Not happy
"Will Not Let Me Log In. Hello, I come to right a review today to say that my personal account, the one I have used for almost five years now, has either been hacked, or glitched, and I can no longer log on.I have tried contacting support multiple times and have only gotten one response, with it saying you dont have 2FA on for this account and you should be able to log in. To which I responded saying that they were wrong, and I sent them the screenshot to prove it. They were investigating the second account I had linked to my email, the one without 2FA, not the one I told them to investigate, and the one that had 2FA on. I am frustrated and annoyed by the lack of response by Facebook to help me get my account back. I had received no secondary response from Facebook when I sent back an additional email. I have received no emails afterwards when I request support. I was polite in my emails and was patient. I just want my account back"
"Instagram deleted my account. Instagram deleted my account without any warning. I didnt violate any rules at all so that is why Im confused as to why my account was deleted. I was scrolling through watching reels when suddenly I got kicked off and then it asked for verification which I did and used my phone number which then said phone not registered. I thought that was weird because it was hooked up. I checked emails for any email regarding in if someone hacked my account but to no avail there was nothing at all. It let me log in manually with the username and password but it kept saying refresh unavailable, challenge_required and verification again. I had to email help center and Im still waiting on it (happened last night). My account was just my personal one which I dont have any understanding why it was deleted to begin with? If anyone is having any issues like that too please just write a review and if you solved it add that too because Ive had my personal account for so many years now and then that happened and now its all gone"
"Cant share posts to story. Overall I really like Instagram. However, theres a bug that some of us have been dealing with for months on end and it still hasnt been fixed. Im not able to share public posts to my story. Im given the option on my other Instagram accounts, but not my main account. Ive researched ways to fix the problem and it seems to be boiling down to an issue that Instagram has neglected to address or fix. Its frustrating that other people and my other accounts have this feature, but my main personal account doesnt. Please address this issue for those of us struggling with this major glitch"
Problem. Im having a problem each time I try to type or scroll down to look at pictures the same thing shows up we limit how often you can do things to help protect our community It just spams on my phone I even trie to go to settings but I couldnt because of that little notif its really frustrating and I dont know why its doing that
"Bugs. Glitches galore. The latest version does not contain bug fixes and performance enhancements. Accounts that have had issues making account changes are still unable to edit their bios, change their profile picture, switch the personal/private/creator profile, update and confirm email addresses, add a 2factor authentication number , or any other type of account change whatsoever. We still can not see notifications. And further more we still have no way to contact IG and it is further proof our error reports are pointless and all are going unread. Would love to up my stars but experiencing so many problems (and the same problems) without a response or a solution since October 2019. Curious how long IG and Facebook will allow these bugs and errors to continue"
"No iPad support. Doesnt even support iPad, Sells your data, and just steals Snapchat features. Whats the point?"
Resharing feature button is not working. The button to allow resharing to stories does not work. Ive attempted several times to click the resharing button feature on and off to have others repost my stories from my business and personal accounts and this button does not work for either account. Both accounts are public. Ive even sent a request for help to instagram support a few days ago and still have not received any sort of response or assistance with this issue
"No longer good for people. Just an algo. I dunno. This was my favourite app for a long time. Its just a corporate algo driven spy fest. We want an internet for people, for individuals, not for corps or data hauls"

Hello instagram, my account got hacked by some random and im very upset. i tried everything to get my account back but nothing works because they changed all my settings. I know this is a personal problem but is there anyway I can get it back? if you cant, can you ban it? i dont want anyone to be in my account if its not me. if you guys can do anything to help me please do. My account is vvirvz and please try to ban it or help me get it back. If u guys can all report it its gonna help a lot. Please just try everything you can to help me, thank you"

"2 Months of Instagram Errors - Please Help. On 8/2/20 Instagram stopped allowing me from adding captions to my photos, liking photos, commenting and accepting new followers. I tried doing the updates and sent 5 reports through the app plus Tweeted Instagram and was ignored every time. Instagram has been my favorite social media joy and I use it to cross promote my chef clients. Its been my lifeline to friends and family all over the world. Please, please can someone at Instagram fix the bugs in my personal account @lisacomento ?? I do not want to start a new account because I worked so hard on that one. Please help fix my account... I have been so sad not being able to use it  Thank you in advance"
Bad app. There is no privacy for Muslims
"Why is my notifications being blocked on one of my account. Hey Instagram,Why is my notifications page on 1 of my accounts I am not able to see it?? I seem to be blocked I also had issues logging in and started another account and I did not want to do that Now I cannot get into my third account It keeps rejecting my email addresses I try to enter on the profile page What is their a glitch or something?? Seems to me someone hacked my Instagram account"
No iPad version and riddled with bot accounts. I cant believe how little the devs care about their app. Everyday I get message requests and tags from numerous fake accounts and no one seems to care. Millions of dollars at their disposal and no fix whatsoever. This is embarrassing. This app is so flawed and left behind in basic stuff that its incredible. The fact that the devs have not implemented some basic features or updates shows how little they care. Im pretty sure that making an iPad version wouldnt be hard and fixing the timeline cause I keep seeing posts from days ago. I dont know who thought it was a good idea to get rid of the chronological order of posts
"No Help with Hacked account. Sent countless emails to Instagram support concerning a hacked account that was blue check verified A hacker within 10 minutes changed the email address linked to the account so we could not access the account at all. Then contacted us by phone requesting $1100 to get the account back. Not only that, they changed the Instagram handle and have even posted that theyre selling the page for $300 dollars for all followers to see. We have reported this post to Instagram as well, and still no help. This is an account with over 13k followers This is absolutely ludicrous INSTAGRAM CAN YOU HELP?"
"Action Blocked Problems. I have been action blocked on my personal account for over 4 weeks now It worked briefly on the 4th week ending, but reverted back to action blocked(after liking 3 posts and following 2 people). Instagram was an amazing place to connect with others and this did the complete opposite. I also had my own penpal account, which currently got action blocked and its really hurting communicating with others. Contacting support from a team is virtually impossible as there is no number to reach them, and the only one available leaves an automated voice message of absence. I would have given it a 1 star, but Instagram has done a fantastic job in the past. I wish for my accounts to revert back because being unable to comment, follow, like, or post is really making me dislike it more and more. I hope Instagram forms a team and looks to our feedback. It seems like Im not he only one with these problems"

"Full of snowflakes. My meme account got taken down, which I have no problem with, but then they also deleted my personal account which had no strikes or warnings. So they deleted everything I had because some people cant take a joke, if youre one of the people who reports stuff for no reason or because youre offended, BLOCK THE USER, theres no reason other should have to suffer because you cant take a joke, out of 1 k followers, 1 person reported my account and they ended up thanos snapping all of my progress, its a fun and nice app, but theyre shouldnt be children or snowflakes on the app. Also the new update setup is hard to use and maneuver"

"Instagram the friendship builder. In the beginning I was slow to hop on the, #hashtagwagon ,I thought it was a little strange, but that was in the beginning. I can honestly say, I have made a good number of personal connections with instagram, that I may have not been able to make otherwise. I have also had the pleasure of being able to remotely experience the growth of the friends I have made on Instagram.  I follow a lot of different things.  Most of it is pretty normal stuff, but some of it is extremely exceptional.  Some of it I havent even gotten to yet.  However, there is not enough time in the day to skim through all that is on offer so I put little red hearts on the things I truly find uplifting. Yes I do read the captions, and yes I do leave comments and interact with the creators and their subsequent followers.

Good Luck Fixing Technical Issues. Because youre going to get zero support from Instagram. Im trying to build my followers but I cant add my website to my bio. A red bar appears but doesnt say what the error is. This only happens on my influencer account and not on my personal account. Ive tried everything to fix it and cant find a solution. Theres no way to contact technical support. Ive reported the issue in the help section at least 10 times by now. Its going to take an act of god to fix this
"Great. Of course its a great app to use anyway but features and interface are becoming much easier to use with more and more updates.Would like a few more features like private stories and maybe some sort of community feature to use instead of a hashtag as theres lots of topics on there?Also having a problem with stories, my personal account uses the new fonts and interface but a different account I use is stuck on the old one? Ive tried all sorts and it doesnt work"
"Idk use it I guess. Honestly pretty solid, just kinda sad to known Mark is data mining me. Not very considerate"
Ive been hacked. So turns out a friend of mine got hacked and I wasnt aware of this and I was texting them and now I am also hacked and cannot get back into my account. Can someone or the app itself help me Ive had my account for years and pictures of my family and son are in their Please help me
"Msomultipotieltiality. I love how simple it is to use, great source for personal &amp; business having a voice to share to the world"
"Suggestions. Love Instagram Personally, I think the buttons shouldve stayed in the same place and the ones at the top be the new features added Super excited to try to shop option And just an idea, when clicking on someones pic, whether that be on their story or the tagged photos, their photo circle icon should pop up instead of their name. That would be so appealing the eye. Or at least with business accounts because sometimes their profile pic is their logo.  Also, on the explore page, I understand the suggestions based on what I like or see or look up but maybe try to add sometime new in the mix, something new I might like even though I didnt go searching for it, I understand how that can be difficult, but I see all the same stuff on my explore page. Anyways, these are my personal thoughts. Keep doing you Instagram lol"
"Horrible. My new business is getting so many mean rooms and I cannot repost anything for months Im tagged in the picture, the Person is a customer writing a lovely message. I dont care I want to view it atleast and repost. Some how I can see the post with my business tagged via my personal account. This is absolutely insane. @houseofazura"
Wow sketchy. Sketchy people selling your info
Update. The latest update has changed the way I log in. Before the update I would click on my profile picture to log in. Now I have to enter my password to access Instagram
"No possible way to contact Instagram. Instagram is a great and fun app until something goes wrong like your account hacked, stolen content, or any technical problems trying to contact them is literally impossible and they make it to where you can't talk to any human being it's very unprofessional"
"HELP. Hi Instagram apps..Just want to ask, how to change fonts on my story personal account? On my business account, fonts story updated. Personal account not. My apps already been updated"
"Account was hacked, still cant log in. My account was hacked this morning and Ive tried everything possible to regain access to my account and no such luck. None of the options in the help centre are helpful. I wish Instagram would email me or call me because this is a nightmare"
Others cant repost my story. I dont have the Allow sharing to story button in my privacy setting please turn it on
"Interesting. Incredible the app can manage to track sensitive medical infomation, transactions etc but every update theres STILL bugs in the most simple platform... come on guys ... at least put in as much effort for both sides"
"instagram is changing for the worst. Ive been a user of instagram for 7 years now and these new updates are just making it too complicated to navigate the app now. specifically I got locked out of my personal account and their support team is nearly impossible to contact for any issues. Ive been speaking to a bot who claims they cannot confirm my identity and while I offered to provide more images and information to prove it, its like im speaking to a brick wall. their new two step authentication feature also needs some fixing. Their sms texts to my phone have not been delivered and it is impossible to log back into my account. None of my backup codes have been working either and I forgot to get new ones. I just dont understand why there isnt an option to email the sms code instead of text, as they email me about everything else. I had been considering leaving instagram for months now after that new shopping feature and this is probably my sign to give up and leave. thanks for the memories"
Give more privacy options. Can you please make it optional to hide my following and followers list from fellow followers
Please fix your update. The new update has made Instagram extremely inaccessible :( I am a disabled user and Instagram has now removed the posting and heart buttons to move them to the top which makes it extremely difficult to reach and interact with comments and to post new content. I find myself having to find new ways to be able to see comments such as going into the post itself and scrolling through and I find it to be a very difficult layout that was unnecessary due to the fact that if I wanted to buy something and shop on Instagram I would look for it I also am finding that I am seeing more users that I do not follow along with ads. I understand why Instagram put shopping to the bottom to encourage users to click on it but if anything it has deterred people from wanting to use the app. Instagram is an incredible tool for businesses and individuals and we need to stop changing it to try to make it something else. Its beautiful just the way it was created 
"Stolen account. My account got stolen and Instagram is no help in retrieving it. Now my account is being used to scam other people on Instagram. Cant contact help, I cant access the email cause it was changed and my password was changed too. I have no clue what to do"
"Fix this. The recent update reshows you a post you didnt interact with. Why should I see it again because I didnt like it or look at the full album. Also the ads are terrible. I get an ad for some random lawyer who posts jokes. Im never following him please show me something normal Id actually buy. I know you guys are tracking what I do show me ads for that. Also, the reels is just a place where people repost tiktoks. Not ONE reels is original on your app. ALL reposts from TikTok. Instagram wants to compete so bad but its just ruining their app"
Momtaz. Please allow us to hide follower and following number and people. We need more privacy please. I dont want people to see who Im following or who follows me
My account got deleted. My old account got deleted because someone hacked at and I couldnt do anything about it they changed my email and username and phone number so I couldnt get it back they changed it from @x_3ld to @donttryfuckingwithme I actually know who hacked it and she is under 13 and Instagram didnt do anything about it and Im so sad about it I really need help my account was deleted 1month ago could you pls help me
DUMB GLITCH. I seen the guy under me have the SAME problem. My music is full of Spanish music and I cant get it to play my music. I switch accounts and it works for that account but when I go back to my account it only has Spanish music. I also put business account for a year now and NOW it stops working. I took it off and put personal account and it STILL DOESNT WORK. INSTAGRAM FIX THIS
Improvement on profile. Love it. My thing I would love to add is more profile characters so I can add more information about myself and specially if I&#39;m a brand owner and I would love to merge my personal page and business page together
"Cant use the music Feature anymore and much more. I live in the US and when i went to the musics for reels, it suddenly popped a message that practically said that we didnt know your account had access to music, we will have to remove that. I believe its because i was a business account but honestly my account is a personal account who wanted to use insights. now i cant get my music back :("
New update is rubbish. It has accused my account of using bots for likes and follows. Btw my account is like my own personal account with like 100 followers lmao like definitely not. And now has restricted me from liking and commenting on posts. And it the new update has stopped me from seeing dms on another account. Im not a bot or using any. Instagram please fix this
You guys arent letting me have a account. Im trying too make a account and it says you cant make a account because of our privacy
Notifications arent working. Okay so my Instagram got hacked a while ago and notifications stopped working and its the only thing not working anymore Ive turned it on and off and even deleted the app nothing is working to get my notifications when Im off the app help
New update makes it slower. The new update containing reels has now made my Instagram extremely slow. I often use data and to browse Instagram and I used to loved the fact that the app was so fast compared to every other app in the game. Not only are the reels slowing down the app its almost like Instagram has turned into tiktok layout and content wise :( Ive been using Instagram since I was young but now Im considering deleting my account and uninstalling
"notifications dont work. for about a year now i havent been getting notifications from instagram at all, but they are enabled on my accounts settings and phone settings and logging out/deleting and re-downloading the app does not fix it. idk how to fix this issue"
"Too many intrusive ads. Unhappy recently with all the ads. Now once I catch up on my personal pictures, I am bombarded with womens fitness and weight lifting, which I am not at all interested in"
blurry story. i take all my pictures on my camera so i know they are decent quality but when i go to post them on my instagram story they are really pixelated and blurry. i reported it twice on the actual app and now im here because i just wanna have good quality storys. i have all the recent updates on both the app and my iphone. i even turned off my data usage i dont know what else to try other then to report it 
Very Good. I love everything about it very good app and one of my best but it consume data a lot please try to improve on that
My original Personal Account got hacked. @ruben_cabuto. I emailed Instagram Security close to 30 times. I lost close to $9k due to the hack and my some of my followers lost plenty of funds due to me not doing this. Its sad that this has yet to be resolved. It is still affecting my new account because clients are scared to follow my new personal account. Plus I had to change my number. Ashamed is an understatement
"Support Issues. I recently was hacked (my fault) and requested password changes etc. I fully completed them; however, the next day I was locked out again. I repeated above steps where my new code was now inactive. Instagram kept sending the same inactive code. The phone numbers are very unhelpful. Can we please work on helping users through actually conversations rather than automated?"
"I gotta be honest. Lately Ive been having horrible connection with instagram and immediately thought it was the WiFi connect from where I was, or/and my data. realized how my other apps work perfectly and Instagram being the only one freezing and not reloading or playing videos. I tried fixing the problem by deleting an reinstalling the app but it still hasnt worked. I dont know what to do any more and I thought to write It here"
Bad update. I cant switch my business account back to a personal account. I cant even edit my bio nor can I change my profile picture. I cant see who follows me or likes/comments on my post. I can post stories and post but I cant see who likes them. I dont even get Instagram notifications on my notification bar. I tried to download the app again and still nothing changed.I tried changing my password and logging out to log back in and still nothing. I hate this new update its like I barely have access to my account now
"Uhhh why??. So I have three separate profiles: a personal, a work related, and a spam account. For some reason, the spam account always gets the beta tests for new feature. Well on 10/13/2020 I opened my feed and they completely changed the layout. Now to see my notifications I have to click a heart, they implemented a tiktok styled video scroll feature in place of the explore page, and theres a shop menu??? My two other accounts have not gotten this but the layout is confusing, and I hope that it is not permanent otherwise I will be deleting my personal and private account"
"please fix this bug. so, ive recently couldnt be able to sign into my instagram account directly from the app on my phone but on other devices. im sure my account is not hacked as ive never shared my personal information with others. all i see when i try to log on is error and sorry, there was a problem with your request. somehow, it lets me login from safari and on other devices but the app is totally broken on my device. please fix this bug. ive seen many more people all over YouTube struggling with the same problem as me. ive been inactive on instagram for a long time now because of this. im worried. please reply to my message and contact me"
Hacked. I dont have a instagram page but someone got my information and made a fake page I am very angry about this the name is Tootie Burks thats not my name and it has my pictures
"Awfull. The last update is awful, why are the messages of deleted accounts appearing   Where is the privacy?  What if I decided to delete everything  related to me in the application  It is terribleI can&#39;t even rate it. It doesn&#39;t deserve a quarter of its star rating"
Too many Ads. Way too many ads in personal feed  Nearly every 4 or 5 posts is an ad
"Create Tab Sections for Restaurants/Bands/etc.?. It would be awesome if you guys created a tab section for your home that could filter posts between restaurants/bands/sports/personal/all/etc. Id love to be able to narrow down my posts to bars and restaurants that I follow when trying to decide where to go or to see whats on special that day, without the clutter of everyone elses posts.Thanks and much love, Instagram"
"Not letting me log in. I have many accounts and when I try to log in, it always says sorry there was a problem with your request and this has been happening for about 3-4 months now. I have been using the browser version of Instagram but there are certain features that you can not have access to and you need to use the app for. Please fix this"
Fake contacts. I am deleting my Instagram app and telling all my friends about my experience to not get the app. I finally convinced a man to tell me the truth in who he was. He gave me info. Of who he is and why he did a fake picture and contacted many women. How do I delete contacts on this app?
"art, eternally photographed. i am grateful for an app such as instagram allowed me to explore my inner artist.via photography i was able to embody some of the greatest ascended masters and become my greatest version of the artist i am.my vision, eternally shared on a server with filters to make them look better until i realized the platform was created for i to share my Self rather than to create a deep fake version of another being.i am who i am because my vision (through photography in my personal experience) evolved thanks to instagram. i have faith this app may bring the best out of you"
"add to calendar. can yall add an add this to your calendar button so that when some is posting about an event theyre hosting or even what time they are going live, we can easily add that to our personal calendar (google calendar, icalendar, etc)"
New update. The new update is not allowing to do the messenger thing at all on my personal page but on my fitness page its there. I deleted FB messenger and IG and re installed both of them. Logged out of both and nothing. Its very annoying that there is a new update that doesnt work Fix this
Please help disabled account. I contacted you many times to fix my issue but no result. I recited few messages asking my details and its been 3 weeks. My account had been locked and I dont have access to my phone number and its not sending me any email. Two factor authorisation not working as well ( after that still asking phone verification). Its my private account with my pictures. Please help me fix this issue I have so many friends that I have contact only by Instagram. I dont want to lose them. Thank you  @Armeniangirlintheuk
"Give the people what they want. Suggestion: you can edit your post that has a sequence of photos and remove some photos if you want. Based off of personal experience, I think this is a money move for sure"
"Music guidelines degrade experience. Recorded someone playing vinyl tracks and IG blocked the video. Im not trying to monetize anything, just capturing a moment. Seems like another money grab opportunity"
"Hacked. Instagram overall I like but somehow I got sent a message about staff of the month etc from a family member. So i thought it would be okay. Its fake, it hacked me and now I cant recover my account no matter what. I have tried multiple ways to recover and nothings working. Please help I have so many pictures and videos that I dont have anymore. And I dont want to make a new account. I am very annoyed at you guys"
Glitch. There is an issues where instagram logged me out of one of my accounts and will not let me access it and says  verify your identity with an email not associated with this account. I dont know if this is a glitch but I am very upset as I cannot access my account
"Suggested posts torture. I dont understand why you put suggested posts on my feed when you have a separate explore page that also has suggested posts according to my algorithm. Just let my feed be people I follow. I hate seeing all that other mess. Id follow those same accounts if I wanted it on my feed. Its my personal feed, so let it be posts Ive personally followed to see. Its not that hard"
"Disappointed. This is my second Instagram account. My first one was under the named of Rozelle Danilson; It was hacked and stolen. The thieves changed my email address, and I didnt get a notification of the change.Even though I reported it stolen several times, nothing has been done. The thieves now have it under a new name of course. Sadly, there are pictures of my family members whove passed away, so needless to say, Im disappointed that havent had this issue resolved with you and that Ive had to make a new account"
The creepy line has been crossed. I hate that I dont understand the privacy settings enough. Im tired of talking about things then adds showing up for them 12 seconds later
"I have One problem with it. So I got instagram and I had one account, at some point me and my friends decided we were gonna have a group account, so we made a group account and something happened to it ( I dont really understand what happened to it) so we made a new account. My friends either logged out of the old one or deleted it but when I tried to log out it would let me, and there wasnt an option to delete it. Eventually I had to delete instagram and download it again, so I logged into my personal account and I go to see if its still there, it is. So now my only option is to turn off all the notifications for it"
Fascisms dream tool. Unreliable form of expressing your freedom of speech.  They even censor and prevent you from sending DMs that they dont agree with.  Which is ultimately an overreach against your privacy and first amendment rights.  Definitely the ideal tool for any authoritative fascist government. Im sure it is loved by sheep around the world though
"Old Account Hacked. My name is Vontrece Wilson. My old Instagram account vonbabydollwilson was hacked Monday morning. Ive been trying to get help to get back into or have it shut down because theyve hacked it & I have no control over the post or communication to tell people the video that was posted is a scam nor to talk anyone from that account because its not me. The person that hacked it is Elizabeth_Young_4. I had to create a new account vbabydollwilson & I can see the video and the false information they posted attached with it. Its embarrassing to me because I would not advertise false information. I have message communication with Elizabeth to prove that they scammed & hacked into my instagram as well as my Facebook. Please please help me, either disable or help me get back into it because its personal to me with my photos & contacts. You can contact at vbabydollwilson"
"Auto Play Videos. Terrible terrible stupid update.   IG is no longer looking classy. What a shame. I  am disappointed that this app, which I have had Profile since 2011, hasnt put the option, which SHOULD BE MY CHOICE if I want  videos to  auto play. I deleted my Facebook, and now I have gone over my data three months in a row because of the stupid auto play videos on IG. I will leave like I left FB.  Unless youre going to pay for my monthly phone bill, dont be choosing what I want to see and specially the videos. Disappointed. Please dont turn into Facebook.  I still like the app, but Im not liking my overage on my data every month because of a simple option We should ALL have. Again, unless you are willing to pay for my bill, I wont mind the video auto play, but until then, if it doesnt stop, I will be deleting my account"
Georgiaeliseallen. I absolutely adored Instagram until they randomly took my account away. I have emailed over and over again and the response team have just not replied. This has completely ruined so many things for me as all my beauty therapies and contacts I use through Instagram I can no longer contact. Not only this but everything I have built from friends to memories saved on Instagram I can no longer access. I have to say that it is appalling how such a greatly used app has no help whatsoever in recovering my Instagram account. I have seen many other cases like this that Instagram does not even bother to reply. I truly do love Instagram but I am so upset and disheartened that they have been so incredible awful in helping me get my wrongfully taken Instagram back to me. I was disabled from my account and followed all the relevant instructions. DO NOT TRUST INSTAGRAM TO HELP YOU IN THESE CASES. i hope Instagram can see this review and I would just like my account back ad soon as possible
Couldnt load users. For some reason idk why I cant see who I follow in my personal page. It keeps saying couldnt load users. Can you pls fix this issue. Im not sure if its just me but Id love to know who Im following. Thank you
"Love the app, have the pixelation probs. I love using Instagram and have had it for years but recently noticed a reduction in the picture quality on uploads and stories. For my personal feed its significant enough for me to have considered deleting the app all together. I changed my iCloud settings to ensure my phone keeps the original photo (so that it wouldnt compress it and mess with the pic size) and Im still having these problems. Has anyone else had this issue? Due to this issue I give insta a 3/5, but if it could be resolved it would be 5/5 stars. Hope this is helpful"
"Cant comment on IG live. For some reason I havent been able to comment or see comments from my personal page. Its been about a month. I have no violations, Ive deleted and reinstalled my password. Idk whats going on"
App. App not responding unable to log out the account cant use it at all this is why I dont used social media unbelievable not even a month and already have problem I am guess the page was hack dont allow me to change the password because I dont know the old one but what is reset for it you cant change the password if you forget youre old one I cant believe this happen and there no customer support with Instagram omg needed to work on this for customer there no help
Profile glitch. I cant access my personal page Every time I click the bottom right icon to go to my profile the app goes black and crashes. Please fix this because Ive had an Instagram for years and this has never happens before. Im disappointed
Music issues. I would like for the business to be able to add music to stories as personal profile do
No apparent support. Weve been mysteriously banned from logging into IG app on smartphone. No explanation.  No assistance.  We can use IG via browser. And can even use IG on phone app w/ our small business profile. But frustrated re treatment on personal account. Seems itd be easy fix for IG. But zero help
No share to story button. I recently created a new account for personal reasons however on my new account i do not have the share to story button which i use often. Ive tried numerous things to try and fix this and reached out to instagram multiple times receiving 0 response
"Account hacked. Account was hacked with a wrong email, and when I tried to change the email I was locked out. Instagram decided to try and email the wrong email a security code so I could login. Therefore since I cant access a hacked email to see the code I cant change the passwords or anything to login anymore. Also there is no support for technical issues"
Help now. Hey so some how every since I got hacked I cannot chat on Instagram messages. Can you please fix that bc I need to tell my followers I got hacked
"Videos not loading. Doesnt matter which Internet I use or if I use data videos even my own dont load, stories dont load or reels dont load"
Help. My Instagram was working just fine and then it logged me out and now I can log in to any of my personal and work pages. It says I have no internet and Im at full bars and the Wi-Fi works. Also Instagram will not assist me on my hacked account and just send me steps that make no scenes and will not answer a single email. HELP YOUR CUSTOMERS fix this issue
"What a app should be. Enjoy the app, easy to use, lots of filters.  Beat part is they havent sold their souls to the corporate advertising like many other good apps have.  Sure there are a few but its not in your face, you can just scroll on past.  Ill continue to be a member until they sell their soul"
Cant create an account. I wanted to make a new Instagram account for only my art instead of using my personal account. I didnt even get to a home page before my account was deactivated for violating the terms? The sort of appeal process was to send photo proof that you own the account... 24 hours later and still no response. This is so frustrating
Music sticker missing. I dont know why Instagram has fixed the very annoying missing music sticker - my primary account still has no sticker ability for story or post but its on my other accounts - from online issues its seems across the board an issue on primary personal accounts - please sort it in next upgrade as its very annoying
"Annoying. Way too many bot/spam accounts flooding Instagrams posts and overall platform. What they are trying to do is lead you to click a link by tempting you with inappropriate pictures, where they then either take your account, personal info, or even your money. These bots are totally wrecking the platform and many are still not taken down despite these bots getting heavily reported. Please fix, these bots ruin the experience"
"Love Instagram. A pure joy interacting with people and photos from all around the globe. As a photographer, Ive discovered my go-to-place fort not only posting my own pictures but I am continuously amazed by the incredible photos posted by photographers the world over. I love Instagram"
The Reels and shop in the bar is not helpful. I use to enjoy Instagram but now its become such an annoyance. The Reels to mimic tik tok are such a sell out way to make their app bigger and the reels just are being shoved down our throats and the average Instagram user doesnt need the shop taking up the bar where the search button should be now the search button is in such bad place to where it takes more work to use the explore feature. Shopping isnt even why people use Instagram Why would the average Instagram user want that to be a priority over the explore feature. Most consumers use the explore feature and reels and the shop are trying to push that away because Instagram wants to sell out when people didnt download Instagram so we can get another Tik tok people got it because they enjoyed classic Instagram style
PLS HELP ME INSTAGRAM. I have been hacked and now cannot access my account due to the fact it has my old phone number as the recovery number. Now I can never get back into my account and there is no way to contact you??Please contact me ASAP
"the app is just always broken. idk why but it always seems like it works three times a week then theres always an outage or something, it never loads anything even when i have good data or wifi, the app used to be good until they hired the moron developers working for instagram now"
Shop and reels tab. Please remove this function. It is useless and makes it harder to access de explore page and notifications. It literally makes me not want to use instagram
Huge Request. Is there any way you guys can make a feature where we can see all the comments weve ever made? Like a link to every post weve commented on. or a settings button that deletes all our messages &amp; comments weve ever made? I think that should be included for privacy
Ppl are tracking you down. So some ppl are are telling others if you want to play a game IGNORE IT THEY WILL KNOW WERE YOU LIVE be safe put you stuff on private
Bad app. Boring and give you stress  also privacy is minus
"IG wont let me share stories. For some reason, IG wont let me share other peoples posts in my story. It works for my works account, but not my personal"
"Issue with uploading videos to my story. I love the app, I use it to not only socialize with friends and keep updated with what going on around the world, but to also share some of my daily activities. I recently discovered I am unable to successfully upload any videos to my story even if its made on the actual app. As simple as adding a gif to a photo that also poses as an issue. Ive tried everything google has told me, including uninstalling then reinstalling, rebooted my phone, switched internet connections and clearing some of its data. I dont know what to do anymore, and I really do not have the energy to create a new account. "
"Cant log in. I love this app, but I havent been able to login to my other accounts, the only way Im able to access them is through the website version of Instagram. Its annoying. Ive sent in 7 complaints asking to get me into my other accounts and I havent gotten a single reply. Seriously, what a I supposed to do? I logged out of them 3 years ago and never been able to log into them since, and yes, they still exist"
Strangers spamming. I dont know  how strangers spam me when my account it private and they are rude
"Eh. It was great, but they copied Snapchat with the stories you cant see who recently liked what posts anymore, nor can you see the amount of likes. Im disappointed but I can understand why they did them. Edit~~ okay soo I installed an app that said that I am using an app to gain followers/ likes, I only use an app to track who unfollowed me so I can unfollow them. My ig is now filled w random posts on my home ig screen too(and expore). They are inaccurate and useless smh. THE UPDATES KEEP GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. Might as well transition to tiktok"
"New Reshare sticker is dumb and should not be on the app. I mean, are you serious? What is the point of this? Why make the process lengthier with a lower quality outcome? Now you have to take a picture to even share a post, and even then its up in the air whether the post will show up in the shareable file. You are Instagram, and are worth millions of dollars. Dont make the features unnecessary complicated and frustrating"
Review from business owner. IG has helped us reach our clients on a more personal level. Only wished that business would get verified a little easier after submitting the documents required
It was great. The terms of service now are terrible and they can take all your personal info
Name ?. Why have you guys set it so you cant change your name or hide it ? Why is it even connected to facebook in the first place. This is a breach in privacy and I demand an update where you can either change the name or hide it
"Spam Problem in Iphone. Hi , i have problem with instagram app in iphone and this happen every day and my page follow automatically people i dont push follow , my third application and website is not linked to my account and my page is private , i changed my password and log out other device , Two step verification enabled but this happen again , and in know this is problem with the app , and make this spam and auto following problem or maybe IOS is not secureded"
"This is ridiculous. I use Instagram for my personal account. I recently opened a business account and from the get go kept getting blocked FOR THE ENTIRE DAY FROM THE NEW ACCOUNT for following too many people. I stopped trying to follow people and YET, every little action I make gets me blocked from my account for THE ENTIRE DAY. Want to edit my caption? BLOCKED. Want to make a post? BLOCKED. This is ridiculous and incredibly frustrating. There is no way to get in touch with anybody to help. Im left with nothing to do"
"Zero Costumer Service. My Instagram account was hacked. Changed all my info and activated a 2-way authenticator so all the options in help center are useless Selfie videos verification keeps getting denied. I have all the email notifications screen shot about the incident, but theres no live person to talk to or even a support address to explain my situation. I had that account for over 11 years A billion dollar company with no live support is a joke"
"Glitches/Unreliable. I havent been able to access my account. Ive entered the correct login info and it still is glitching and showing this pop up that wont allow me to select either option for it to go away. The help center has virtually no information on this issue, and Instagram has no help center or email or phone number that I can contact for help. This is not a reliable platform"
"Terrible update. Replacing the bottom row for the most frequently used parts of Instagram with shop and reels? What a mistake, so inconvenient to have to go to the home page to look at my notifications and to make a post, is so irritating. Especially in this day in age when phones are substantially large and now having to use two hands to check my notifications when we used to be able to just use the one hand and one thumb. Very disappointing and has definitely changed the way I use Instagram for the worse. Ugh I hope this gets changed"
"Instagram 166.1 update feels wrong. The like tab and the add post tab are no longer at the bottom of the app, instead you get the ridiculousness that is reels and shopping. This app constantly disappoints me. Im not on here to see strangers doing the same thing they do on tiktok. Nor am I here to buy stuff. Way to make instagram lose the personal feel. Update 166.1 stinks. Do not update"
Direct Delivery of Spam. App algorithms seem to be designed to only show spam accounts that repost stolen content
Only works on Wi-Fi. My app dont work on data its really annoying cant post or even go live when being outside it use to work perfectly I deleted the app reinstalled it deleted data from the phone no use if this gets resolved stars will go up
Disappointed my account was hacked. So my account was hacked about 2 weeks ago and Ive been trying to contact instagram and have gotten nothing.  No email works and the phone number you cant talk to anyone. My account @Breezy_daysaway was hacked by a person associated with @_missmarclynn_ . Please someone help me get my account back
"Hate the IG app? Use mobile web version. Y&#39;all complaining about the IG app? Me too. I use the mobile web version of IG and FB. Yeah it&#39;s a bit of a pain, but I refuse to reinstall the IG and FB apps. Those apps behave very erratically for me on all phones I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s a pity since IG is becoming more-used by lots of people I care about"
Palestine. Please stop censoring information related to Palestine
"Show me notification badges for more than just DMs. As much as I love Instagram I wish we had the ability to see number badge notifications above our app icon for more than just a direct message. Because the only person who DMs me on there is my husband, where as I get more notifications for likes and comments than a private message and I find it a little annoying that I only get a badge number notification when I get a private message instead of when I get likes or comments on my posts"
"Professional & objective. Due to personal interests of your employees with armenian roots, we are struggling of removing our independent opinions, comments and messagesI suggest you to be more professional, objective and avoid the conflict of interests among your team members"
Dont download. Intrudes on privacy
"Music on stories. I cant use the music I want to use on my story anymore. If you use a personal account there are many more music options, but with a business account, they changed something so now its only generic music and any songs you search for wont show up"
Automatically logs in. After downloading instead of asking for account user and password it logs in automatically to my account. Then when I uninstall and reinstall it still logs me in automatically. Why? Why can my privacy not be respected?
"Update after update to steal your info. All you guys do is update the app on our phones every week to see what weve been doing. Its disgusting. I know it resets the star ratings here, too. Cant have everyone seeing the true rating it would be, if you didnt update it constantly"
"never download. A horrible app, designed to sell your info to the highest bidder. Its a horrible influence on kids, it causes kids to think that everyones lives is perfect except theres"
Instagram internet connection error?. Im not sure how this happened but I am no longer able to use IG due to internet connection issues even though my phone is clearly connected to the internet and I have data. I dont understand how this type of error could happen. I have an iPhone 12 mini for reference its not like my phone is old
POP-UP ART EVENT. Fun + engaging visual platform w/ proven track record. Evolves with its community. Great for Business + Community Culture Building 
Update. The new update doesnt let me access data & liked posts
"PLEASE remove suggested posts on home feed. Theres a reason to separate explore page and home feed- one is for personal followings and the other is for exploring other posts. Having another explore feed on our main feed not only is redundant but it doubles the ads and it drastically reduces engagement on our own personal posts. Having to click and navigate to see past posts is irritating and leads to less engagement for the people we follow. People are using the app less now for personal accounts because it is catering too much to influencers, shopping, and overall capitalist ventures"
Switch to another app. I never see pictures of the people I actually care about. The algorithm is garbage. The new update is garbage. I refuse to use this app anymore
Problem. I havent been able to see the amount of likes on any post and i cant fix it because when i go to privacy settings it doesnt show post
App getting worse. I havent been able to use the music function on my professional pages stories but can on my personal which is logged in from the same phone. Very frustrating I wish an app like Instagram would have it together by now. Irks me every time I try and search a song and theyre random songs Ive never heard of and cant search for songs I want to use. PLEASE FIX THIS
Sad ... 7 years on this app building brands and this is the thanks we get ... shame shame shame. Yall could have been the revolution but now your just the thought police ... so sad ... we the creators built this platform to what it is today ...some of yall should be held accountable for crimes against humanity with what youve done here ... breaks my heart to see power corrupt something so amaizng ... years Ive been using this app as a place for my online presence for people who meet me playing music to find me... and all the algorithm changes to hide people at first so they could pay to reach their audience then these disgusting pushes to take non properly tested drugs from transnational criminal orginizations who have been caught breaking human rights laws ... and pushing political bias as a publisher and lets not even get started on data mining and how one day enough of us will get smart and come for our publishing revenue ... yall could be the best thing that ever happened and here we are ... years later and yall sold out and humanity with you ... sad
I hate the new update. Edit: still hate the update. But now my accounts are glitching and randomly switching between my personal and business. Its harder than ever to post a story...AGAIN I HATE THIS UPDATE. Why would you put the shopping button where notifications used to be.... hmmm maybe to fill your pockets and the pockets of big brands. This is my SMALL BUSINESS Instagram page Im talking about. So zero help for my own business but plenty for big brands. This is awful. I hate it. I hate this app more and more every year w stupid updates like this. Giving me ads every 4th post and spamming me with Covid and voting updates
"Still Cant Hide Likes. Instagram is great until you see new features and cant get them yourself. Supposedly everyone has the option to hide likes except for myself. Ive logged out of other accounts,  updated the app, and still cant see posts under privacy. No matter how many times you email support you never hear back. Whats the deal?"
"Glaring bugs from  an overpaid team of engineers. With the latest update, you can no longer update the app\'s access to specific photos on your phone, thus rendering it unusable garbage unless you\'re willing to give up all privacy. Pretty inexcusable to have such as basic feature non-functional from such a mainstream app owned by such a bloated rich company.The constant pressure toward reels and videos is pretty gross too. I\'m just glad I don\'t rely on this terrible platform to make a living"
System still down. I was able to gain access into my business account but I cant access my personal one and its starting to irk me because I have many pictures there that I dont have anywhere else 
"Very Angry. My account got hacked. I have email and sent this selfie thing. I got a response once, as soon as I logged in to my account I was logged out and the people who took over my account took control. Its very sad that IG doesnt have 1-1 customer support for things like this. I have tried all the steps in different ways and even watched a video. I dont need need people with access to my personal things. For those of you who read this under stand that if your account is taken over and they change the email for the account and set up 2 factor authorization your screwed unless you get lucky. I really expect a billion $ company like you to have better security measures. The only reason I will continue to use this app is to keep in contact with a few friends but not much more. Do no expect a good review for a while"
account hacked. Hello I tried email instergram and send messages my account is hacked I have pictures there Instagram said it will take one day but I cant login to my account can you help me out
HELP. It wont let me access my account data recovery
"My account has been hacked. Two weeks ago I tried lining at my Instagram account and all my followers where gone as well as my images. I try to login and it reads that my Instagram account has been compromised that I have shared my password, which I never did. I tried everything to recover it even by changing my password but it doesnt even let me do this it says my old password is incorrect and it is the one I had all these years. I also tried sending my phone number to get a link and I click on the link and it says there is a problem login in. I also tried putting my account name and it says there is a problem trying to login at the moment. I am not sure where I could send a picture ID and all my information to recover my password my IG is @lapaugarcor"
"stories and dms. so when i go to my story and swipe to create and select multiple, i select the pictures and try to create it but it wont let me use all of the photos. WHATS THE POINT OF LETTING YOU SELECT MULTIPLE IF YOU CANT USE ALL OF THE PHOTOS??????i care about my safety and i like to have my dms off. so i turned them off and i still get dms. i turned them off for safty reason and its not working. its absolutely ridiculous. if you are gonna give the option to turn off dms. COMPLETELY DEACTIVATE THEM. thats instagrams job and there not doing it. it needs to be to where i cant dm anyone and no onr can dm meridiculous"
"RIDICULOUS. I had an account that a few thousand followers that I connected with all over the world. It got hacked/stolen and not even a few hours later, I reported it and emailed multiple times. Instagram hasnt gotten back to me EVEN ONCE and my account has been lost to me now forever. All of my followers and friends had to go through multiple annoying spam messages and all my pictures and connections are gone now. I used to love Instagram but the customer service and the care they have for their users is non existent. This is ridiculous"
Stupidity. First off I get my account hacked and then the team when sending facial recognition cant verify its me when I had 20 posts on my page. Then I go to create a new one and it changes the email I originally verified it with and locks me out. So I go and create a new one make sure email is correct and then every time I open the app it asks me to verify my phone number and the number is correct I just dont get the codes and am now locked out of yet another account. There is no good support team that actually helps you with issues like hacking
"cant log back into my account. recently i've decided to reset my phone and delete all of my data because of some issues with my storage. this made my instagram log me out. i couldn't remember my password, and i've been attempting to log back in with the login codes and other methods of resetting my password. i've never received any login code, and every time i try to get instagram to send me one, it tells me there was a problem and to try again. please fix it"
"Locked out of my professional account. September 22, 2020Im an artist and have been ahappy Instagram user for many years. A week ago I suddenly received a message stating my account has been Temporarily locked. The message suggested phishing as a possible reason. The next screen that comes up is to request a verification code, to access the account again. As my email is associated with this account, thats where the code should go to  but I havent yet received anything, despite of multiple attempts during the past week, as well as lengthy conversations with my email provider IiNet to ensure there are no problems with the server, exceeded mail quota etc.As a result, Ive been LOCKED OUT of my main promotional tool. Nothing Ive tried seems to help. My profile has also been edited: A link to my personal blog has disappeared. I can not access the settings to change any security details now, or see private message or actions that may have been performed via the locked account.I havent used any third party apps to manipulate my following or violated any community guidelines.Ive written to Instagram help (flagged a hacked account + Something isnt working), as well as reported the issue via Facebook. No change or response. Meanwhile, Im not able to post new work, interact with my followers, or support those Im following. Due to COVID-19, this avenue has been more important than ever, but now gone.Instagram, PLEASE HELP @ordinari_observer"
problem. use to much data
"Wont let me get rid of notifications. It seems like with every update, there comes a new bug and issue they have to fix all over again. I get spam notifications now from OLD MESSAGES that Ive DELETED or have already seen, but it will not let me clear them out. Instagram fixes bugs that arent even there and makes it less enjoyable to be on the app"
"Update Needed. I do not appreciate how I am not able to use discover to pull up all of my Facebook friends all at the same time. I am suggested a bunch of people who dont follow back, who I dont even know or dont even post And the notifications tab needs to be swapped with the market tab because most people care more about their notifications than what people are selling"
"World's Crappiest Algorithm App. Ad spamming, broken notifications, absolute no customer service, unknown suspensions, riddled with bots, no camera privacy, harassment to confirm email, not kept chronologial, poor resolution upload, invasion of privacy, sells your data, greedy fat cats and much more. There&#39;s literally NO reason to support such a trash app. I also find it very interesting how they&#39;re always having &#34;bug fixes updates&#34; yet literally nothing changes. It actually ends up worse. Extremely shady and flat out illegal practices here. Please ditch this &#34;service&#34;, people It&#39;s long overdue"
These features are urgent. Please add these urgent features:- Touch ID/Face ID locking support- Clear caches data
This dumb ass app. So I have had Instagram since 2017 and it has never been a problem I have got hacked and everything and after that Instagram still worked now when I try to login to my page is says sorry theres something wrong with ur request. 
I phone 11. I am not able to access my personal page on Instagram on my new IPhone 11 I press the person icon and the screen just goes black and I cant login to my second Instagram account Please help
Garbage. Constantly getting action blocked on a private personal account with 17 followers and am shadowbanned on my public account which only has 30 followers and only posted about once or twice a month with 6-7 hashtags per post. I do not use any 3rd party apps or spam like/follow. Annoying push notifications as well
Hacking. Hacking is at an all time high. I lost my page to a hacker and IG asked me to verify myself by video and still did nothing. The hacker is posting my personal pics and trying to get people to invest with them. Its ridiculous and after I reported the page repeatedly nothing was done. I kept getting a message saying the page doesnt go against community guidelines although its someone pretending to be me so they wont remove the page
"Bugs. Recently my app updated. And now I cant upload videos to my story or post. Ive restarted my phone, reinstalled the app, and cleaned the cache and data nothing is working"
"Yes please record me on the loo. Who wants to grant Mark and his team or to whoever he sells your info, total access to enable your mic and camera??? Not me"
"Were sorry but something went wrong. Please help. Ive never had this issue before, but recently this app stopped loading new content in any/all of the tabs (news feed, discover, etc.) and does not even update my own profile. An error reads  Were sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again or please try again later pops up. I have updated the app, updated the software on my phone, restarted my phone, and confirmed that I have both adequate WiFi and cellular data available. Thank you so much for your time (I will be sure update this review when/if issue is solved?)"
"Limited number of comment issue. I love Instagram and have my personal account and also one for my beautiful Shih Tzu. We put up cute pictures/videos using stories and find it fun and easy to do. Since the latest update I keep getting a comment we limit how often you can do certain things on Instagram like commenting etc. This is beginning to get really annoying I probably today commented or used an emoji 20 times and now I can no longer comment etc. This is happening every day recently. I report the problem but nothing happens? Please can you explain why this happens and also how to stop it as its making Instagram annoyingGreat app, fun, but getting frustrated now"
"instagram bug. my instagram has been messing up quite a lot recently, like it keeps saying error or that theres a problem and nothing is loading. ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it and when i logged back in, the home page was the old instagram not the newest update. i cant access my personal information and i dont know what to do"
Used to be Cool. Now its made to track the spending habits of boomers.  The baby boomer generation literally ruins everything it touches.  Some legacy to leave behind.  App serves no legitimate purpose except to exploit and divide humans.  Booo
Hacking. Never downloading this app again its just full of scammers that try to take your account to hack more of your friends just stick with what you were using before
"Quality. I never really had this problem before but recently I cant even post because when I do, Instagram lowers my quality significantly. It will be grainy and out of focus like Im using a flip phone in 2006. This makes me not want to post because whats the point when I cant make out the picture or I look like a robot. Please fix this soon"
Filters are a joke. I have been using Instagram for a long time and I love navigating through the app but when it comes to taking pictures and using filters oh no I love taking pictures and playing with the filters but its been a while since I cant do that. I click on a filter and my screen is frozen it wont let me click on anything else so I have to close the app. I deleted the app and downloaded it again. I restarted my phone and nothing seems to help. I dont know why its not working
"All the bugs. Whenever I try to post a story, the upload fails and Im almost instantly logged out with no specific messaging as to why. Yes, I updated my iOS. Yes, I deleted and reinstalled the app. No, Im not signed in on other devices. No, I dont have multiple accounts. No, I havent gotten any indication that my account had been hacked. And in the brief few minutes that I was able to access my account I tried to submit a report for this technical issue which returned a report submission failed message. So I cant even get some help from Instagram. Its an infinite Instagram loop of we dont know her"
"Unable to contact Instagram Support. My Instagram account keeps getting hacked multiple times, no matter what I do as advised by the Instagram help page to secure and I have been unable to find any phone number or email address to get support with this issue"
"Got hacked. Instagram, I have been hacked on Tuesday January 18th around 7pm. I use this account to post about my furniture account to help me sell it for a living and money for school. My account was originally gracie.benson8 and they changed it too gracie__benson8 and deleted my bio and changed my email and password. I have proof its my account and someone is trying to pretend to be me to get veiws or money. I would love to get it back. Please update your recovery process to be better. Thanks"
"I dont have a sharing feature. I am very disappointed because I do not seem to have a feature that everyone else does. In my privacy settings, there is no way for my posts to be shared to other peoples stories. I have followed the directions of many people and videos and I just dont have the feature that allows me to turn on sharing of my posts to others stories. very disappointed"
It would be nice if a post could upload. On more than a dozen posts in the last month on my professional account ( since they deleted my personal account) Instagram has refused to upload my content. This platform it utterly incompetent but no other option since zuck gets a pass on running a monopoly
"Incredible App. Im actually starting to learn how to use Instagram, I had no idea the power and the reach it has,Its just not for kids"
"Glitch?. Every time I try to take a picture for my story, instagram closes on me.. I had a lot of problems trying to delete and reinstall the app to the point of completely resetting my phone only for it to happen again. Fix This"
"The Settings. The app is good, but Im having trouble logging out of my account and accessing the settings. Ive downloaded the app hundreds of times and it still gives me this problem"
"Poor service. I have 7 accounts on IG and cant add captions to my post, like, follow or comment on other post and was said to have violated my own trademark by sharing my business post to my personal page and tagging. IG has not responded to repeated DMs"
Notifications. I have problems with my notifications i deleted the app and downloaded it back but its still not working I updated my phone that still didnt work
UPDATE PRIVACY SETTINGS. why do i have to go private just for the saved post option to be off?? change it now. its weird
Help. Ive been hacked. I have changed my password three times now changed my photo twice and still this hacker is hacking my account I dont know where to find out what theyre using of mine? Could someone help me? The new account picture is me in a blue scaf. Thank you
"Horrible, invasive ads. I struggle with body image and only post photos of myself in non-revealing clothing. So I was given ads for women who want their breasts to look bigger. This disturbed and hurt me because I did not think that part of my body was on the list of things about me that are not beautiful enough. Months before this, I was crying on my floor after the death of a friend while my phone was near my body, and that same night I get an ad for a crisis depression service. This is angering and damaging to my mental health and the mental health of so many others. Do not spy on the deepest personal parts of ourselves to make us feel so bad that we want to buy bogus products. Do not capitalize on our trauma. That is a line you do not cross. You have deeply hurt me and the larger community for the sake of profit"
They disabled my personal account. Insta disabled my account but i did not why they blocked my account they even not sharing any link to me to recover my account
"Absolutely Incredible . I couldnt ask for more in an app. Theres Direct Messages, Commenting Sections and even Liking Systems. Thank you so much Instagram"
"Kinda Creepy. If Im looking at something online, on websites like Amazon, tell me why all the sudden I see an advertisement on Instagram, its creepy and Im scared for my privacy. A few days ago I was looking to get a jersey, the very next day, I see that same jersey on this app advertising it. "
Missing Features. I have one personal and business account and my business account lacks the standard features like adding music and new animated fonts and theres no way of fixing it
"I cant share stories. Im disappointed. My friends has a great business page, her sharing of stories is enabled, but I am still unable to share her stories to my personal page"
"Continued issues. I am so disappointed about the service I have been receiving from the Support Team I have had Account issues of errors, stories and still dont have access to Reels I have been dealing with the support team for over a month with no resolution My dedicated FB Team member Marcd@Fb has not been communicating or responding to my emails I have a business account and it has effected my work, especially this busy holiday season I have lost work and clients due to thisIn addition, I had a breach of privacy where the support team CCd another persons email on my train of account issue emails exposing all my communications to them They also added her account issues on my email.It woujd be greatly appreciated if I could have this resolved.Thank you for your time.Warmest,Irene"
Hackers. Someone that goes by name  armeseirika  has been hacking into my account all this week  I have emailed Instagram several times trying to get help  This person changed the name of my account to armeseirika I am now getting emails from from so many weird places . All of people trying to access my account have been from USA Im done you need to get better security
"Thanks I hate it. I really dislike the new name settings, I changed my name because I dont put my name on my account because I like having privacy but it was meant to be funny but I cant change it and my name shows up as it to people. Im unsure if theres somewhere in the settings I can change it but it says I can only change it twice every 14 days and I hate it. I spend a lot of time on Instagram and now messaging ppl is uncomfortable"
"Account is hacked plz help. Hey instagram, since you guys dont have any way of contacting you, please help me get my account back. It just got hacked and everything has been changed by the hacker so theres no way of me getting any links to restore my account. > newera875_ It would mean a lot"
Down. Instagram is not working at all. It currently wont allow me to access to the log in page. The only option it allows me to see is Get help loggin in when I have not even attempted to log into my account. Once selecting that option there is no option to attempt to log in. I have no emails stating my information has been changed as if someone were trying to hack my account and I have the two way authentication set up and nothing has come across on there as if someone is hacking. Instagram needs to fix their problems
Why do my likes not show?. I dont like that Instagram forced my personal account @Jouhaina_to not be able to show the number of likes. Either force all accounts to do so or give individuals back their choice to exercise their preferences as they see fit
APP IS BROKEN. Ive tried everything to try and log back into my accounts on my app and nothings worked. It always comes up with a error saying sorry your request cannot be made It works on the internet but not the app. I use Instagram for a personal and business account so the accessibilities on the app that cant be used on the internet is annoying. Ive seen various people have the same problem as me. INSTAGRAM FIX YOUR APPPPP
Great. Okay Im honestly really agervated. I have 2 accounts on Instagram. An art account and a personal one. When Im in  my art account it says that I have a message in my personal but when I go into my personal account and into my inbox there is no messages. Does anybody have any suggestions?
"Not getting any updates. The new updates and themes started in 2020 and its 2021 and I still dont have them on my account I dont have the text themes nor the new look on the home page? I updated and deleted the app again and nothing works But it works if I log into my friends account from my phone but my account doesnt work PLEASE FIXEvery account has the themes and the home page updated but for some reason my account doesnt and I made sure if its just my account or is it a problem from my phone but NO its just my own personal account??? Please fix this, I also reported it wayy too many times but no one replies I dont even think they check the reports in here Email me if you actually read this and I will give you my username so you can check this and if you dont well FIX YOUR APP You never open reports sent to you so I really hope you do open this"
"Algorithm Also cant share Stories. Love the community, HATE the algorithm.Also, I cant share my Story from one account by another account. There is no paper airplane option to send it to my Story. Ive checked the Privacy settings"
Horrible customer service. Wouldnt let me get back in my old account because I changed email and did everything instagram asked me sending pictures of myself with the number they provided not once but twice and they couldnt verify it was me???????????What a joke that Im not allowed to get back my personal pictures and they wont help besides deny me when I did everything that they asked Horrible site
"Useless....Multiple accounts dont work anymore. Can only access one of my accounts, the instant you press bottom right to switch accounts the screen goes black. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. Can not access my other accounts, no info on how to wipe the instas files left on device after uninstalling (there are as it remembers you last login). Absolute joke"
Its going down every week. You really need to get a handle on your app at this point it shouldnt be going down and caving in on itself this frequently. Yall must not like money or something cant advertise stuff to people if you cant get data cause your app goes down every week
"Cant share posts on story. This problem has been occurring for years now on my profile. I cant share personal and public posts on my story. Theres no option for that. I only have the option of messaging my friends the post. Ive tried contacting instagram (no reply), Ive submitted reports (no reply), Ive tried changing my settings multiple times, I tried sharing from different accounts (private, public, and business), Ive tried deleting instagram and redownloading it. NOTHING WORKS. Im a board member of a club, and I cant even promote my own club by sharing the clubs posts on my story. This is incredibly frustrating"
"Cannot treat people this way. And expect no bill to pay.... it is a shame this is also part of the giant scam of inferred privacy. Spoiler alert, you have none"
"I cant log back in. I love this app dont get me wrong but recently I deleted the app because for some reason I wasnt getting like and comment notifications, and when I tried logging back in, it wouldnt let me; the password was correct and my username was correct too, I clicked forgot my password and I got a code, I plugged it in and it said error I tried 5 times and it still didnt work. instagram I want my account back cause I font want to make another account, I want all my data back and everything"
Love you all. Love the global exchange of information that occurs on here. Give my sincere thanks to the inventor of this app
"Security code. Logged me out of my account, Ive got all the right info like my email, phone number and password. When I go to log in it says I need a security code but I never receive one for sms. I tried getting one from my email and got it but it told me I needed to get my security code from my sms"
Spam notifications. I dont want any notifications apart from messages. Why is this too much to ask?Ive turned all notifications off apart from direct messages and still get notifications when people post stories or posts for the first time in a while
I want to refresh my IG into business. I would like if you guys have an option to wipe out / restart an instagram account. I switch from a personal to a business and not all my followers or people I follow are interested in my new page. So it would be amazing if you guys offered to unfollow mass people without being blocked from it. Not everyone is a scammer so please look into doing this in the next update
Business page. My IG business does not have music or new fonts. How does this help a small business engage? I love IG. But my personal has all the cool new stuff and my business page has nothing cool. Please fix this. 
Change your new terms and conditions. Rewrite your invasive terms and conditions Stay out of our personal business

"Cant Use Instagram From Home PC. Instagram keeps saying Im using an app to acquire followers, and then they block me for a week.   I do not use any 3rd party apps.   I mostly use Instagram app installed on my iPhone during the day, but often at night Id login to Instagram on my home pc to review activities,,, posting likes and comments.   Instagram is not sophisticated enough to link my home  IP address to my account.   The blocking always happens when I using my PC, using google chrome as my browser.   Attempts to alert Instagram of the problem have failed.  I get no response.   Otherwise Instagram is an incredible app.   I use it to post what I see in my daily beachside bike rides in Florida.   Im not a novice,,, having almost 10k followers"
"Disabled my account of 4 years. Loved Instagram, used it everyday Had my account for nearly 4 years, 201 posts uploaded, 10.1k followers, and a lot of tagged photos with other Instagram users, and because some low life reported my account for being fake and impersonating someone else Instagram deleted my account and when I try to send through my ID to prove its me they tell me there is a problem and Im unable to send through the dispute form, so I have just lost all my photos and all my Instagram data because Instagram seems to think a real account is fake, yet when Ive had numerous people make actual fake accounts of me they dont get deleted. Im not making another Instagram account and I no longer like Instagram. So disappointed and angry"
"STORY LIKES. I like to post a lot of things on my story. I like to share posts from the explore page that I think are funny, and a lot of my friends go to them from there. HOWEVER, I am never posting a single thing on my story ever again until I have the ability to disable story likes on my page, or at least hide all notifications for them in the app. It is INFURIATING how much they swamp out everything else both in the app and on my phone overall. If I share 10 stories and just 3 of my followers go down and like every single one, that's 30 NOTIFICATIONS. And that's just my personal account I can't imagine what a business account with many followers has to go through. This absolutely must be fixed because it is by far one of the worst features I've seen on this app in a long time and is significantly decreasing my enjoyment.The new story polls are nice though"
"Personal Page Not Refreshing?. My personal page is not refreshing but my other client accounts are fine. Even on a PC, my personal page wont load. Stories seem to be updating but nothing is loading for my actual feed. This has been going on for 15 hours now I have tried restarting my phone, uninstalling the app, and doing an update. Nothing has fixed the issue"
"bullying or karma?. Ive ignored the newest Instagram update, I thought the design was not my style, but I loved the idea of changing the chats color & making it personal. So I updated it, and the only thing the update gave me was the part I hated. I dont have the ability to change chats, or personalize them. Kind of rude "
"Plz add New Mysterious Features . The updates are good rn but I think if u add the new feature(That anyone cant see your following list except u) will be very good.

"ZERO HELP WITH HACKED ACCOUNT RECOVERY. If your account gets hacked by an unknown source, good luck receiving any help. My personal Instagram account that I have had for several years was hacked back in March. I have continuously tried contacting anyone that works from this company to no avail. It is now almost August and my account is still there being used by whom ever stole it. I have personal information (obviously) with that account and all Ive wanted was for them to either delete the account completely or give me access to it to change the password/email. I had to make a brand new account just to ask for the help in the first place which theyve continuously ignored. Thanks for nothing"

It keeps coming up as sorry there was a problem with your request. I am able to log in via google/ internet browser but i need access via the app  Ive tried offloading all data too which has not worked. This is really irritating and needs fixed.

Dont bother with customer support. My account got hacked recently I tried everything with their support team even sending them a video of my face for verification because they needed that and to see pictures of me on the profile that was hacked and they couldnt verify that it was me?

I would like to be able to change highlights that were originally close friends to public. I put a trip overseas in my stories in my close friends category because I didnt want the public to know I was out of town. I would, however, like to show my trip now that Im back. It would be really cool to be able to change the privacy of stories once they are in your highlights and no longer in your archive.Honestly, it would be nice to be able to change that in regular stores as well. Especially with whats been going on with protests, sometimes stories are time sensitive within 24 hours.Surprise parties.Engagement plans.Season Finale reactions. It would be cool to suddenly allow your followers to see a story that needed to remain private for a small amount of time before its release.You know, instead of having to repost completely"

"ACCOUNT DISABLED FOR NO REASON. So, about a day ago I tried to log into Instagram on my phone but to my shock it said that my account was not able to be signed in to as you were bizarrely checking \'my information provided\' (or something like that - even tho I had not provided any information...), and so I waited the 24 hours for you to get back to me and it now says my account has been deactivated Maybe it\'s sad of me to say, but I am quite upset that my Instagram account has been deactivated for no apparent reason and without warning. I think it must have been hacked?? So, I tried to appeal this decision using the in-app form... but it wants me to LOG INTO Instagram itself and confirm that this is me.... but how can I do that when my account has been deactivated?? Stupid. And it seems the Reddit and Quora communities have also had this problem MANY times. I can provide you screenshots of my account to show it is me, my passport photo / driving license / student ID whatever you need to, please, get my account back. How dumb is it to get people to confirm their accounts by logging into.... DISABLED accounts they cannot access?? "

"Locked account due to phishing. So I was using my Instagram like usual. And suddenly the app says my account has been locked due to phishing. The app told me to send a code to my email but now it turns out my email is not opening. So basically Ive been hacked. Its nonsense that someone else is using MY account, with MY FACE and MY IDENTITY, just because I cant access my email. Isnt there a way to show my face or going to an office of yours and show you thats my account? Or any other way? Its the account Ive had since ALWAYS. How is not possible for someone who is the person in the pictures to verify his account? What can I do?"

I just read that someone has the same problem as me, that the music on your Instagram story that you would normally listen to doesnt appear anymore as if it doesnt exist, Ive had this problem for two days now and I thought it was because I had a business account so I switched it to a personal one and that didnt work, I deleted the app and that didnt work either, I thought I was the only one and I would always put music in the background for everything but now its just boring like... I dont know it doesnt make sense, the music they suggested isnt even close to what I listen too and some of them dont even exist when you look them up, its honestly confusing I hope they fix it because its lacking a lot right now"

But when I was trying to log back in I was having difficulties. I know my password but the problem is ,is that they send a code to my number at 9099972990 but that number doesnt work anymore for me, so I dont receive anything. And the email that was used with my account was my old one and I dont have access to it. I tried using my two factor authentication but its saying the codes is invalid. My account is connected to Facebook but when I try to log in with my Facebook it would say sorry something went wrong please try again or it would also ask for a code. I had already reported my issues. When I report the issue Im having a Facebook email reached out to me saying to reply back by taking a picture of myself holding a code they gave me with my full name and username. I already did all that and I havent heard back from them after that. So I was wondering if theres a way you guys can give me access to my account this are the codes that I was given when I turned on the two factor authenticationBut once again when I try using them its saying its invalid. Can you please help me. My username is @bby.b33                                  The only thing that is stopping my from logging into my account is the code . I know my password and everything.

Accounts center. The new update makes it difficult to manage separate personal and business accounts
Cant view all my liked posts anymore. Ever since one of the newer updates this year I cant view all my liked posts since Instagram now sorts them by date rather than when you liked them. Ive sent multiple reports with nothing back so I guess they want to keep it this way and its incredible that they arent recipient with their feedback. Its really frustrating trying to find certain posts now. I cant keep saving every post I want to go back to so Im using this app less

"Ive been Hacked. Instagram is a great and usually safe platform, but over the course of 2021-2022 my account has been hacked twice. The first time Instagram did not help yet I was successful at changing my passwords in time. However, on March 14th I had relized my email was changed in my personal section. Before I could do anything I was locked out of my account. Both verifications were changed. Since they have been posting spam on my account trying to fraudulently steel money from unsespecting people. They texted the number that was used for the old varification (my phone) and sent me a ransom to pay $1000. Since I have continuously called Instagram help services and emailed the Instagram help center, and have yet to reach a reply, even though it said on their website they would take up to two days latest to get back to me. I would like to Baruch the account by showing ID, however Instagram has now made that impossible for me to do since Ive been locked out for over 48hours. My hacked account has spammed nearly 25 people in the past few hours. Knowing there is nothing left, Instagram people if you are reading this, please create an easier way to recover a hacked account. If your wondering why I wasnt able to simply reverse the email swich, thats due to Instagram accepting for me without my knowledge. On the email it simply asked me to varify my self however, it would send that message strait back to the hacker. I know this because the first and last letter of the email and phone number were revealed, and both were not my orriginal. Please help me get my account back or take the account compleatly offline. Either way it would bring me peace knowing this person wont do the same to others from my account. Thank you (orriginal hacked insta name: @AndjBanj) < hacked account. -Andreea B"

cant login. i logged out of my account due to instagram not loading properly. i tried logging back in but it sends the code to my old phone number (that i no longer have access to) and i have tried contacting them several times but never received anything besides once. its been almost a week trying to log back into my account. i think they should give you the option to pick from either your phone number or email to send codes too. this is ridiculous
Account. This app should be like if someone hacks you you can get your account back 
"Reported an issue and my account was deleted. After finding that an account impersonating me, I reported the problem to Instagram. Within an hour I was locked out of my personal account and they asked me to submit a code that I received via text.  I did and within 24 hours my account was permanently deleted. I did everything right, two factor authentication, years of posts, connected my Instagram and Facebook accounts and they still deleted my account.

"App update is terrible. Honestly, this most recent app update was a mistake. The new shop tab is not easy/enjoyable to navigate, not to mention it was a completely unnecessary addition. Its bad enough being bombarded with paid partnership content with influencers on Instagram, but now theyre just blatantly trying to sell you things as their priority, when this app was originally intended to be like a photo album to share with your friends. Disappointing to see the path its headed down"

Cannot view stories, cannot have filters added onto face or when filming videos Its gone downhill this app and I have used it since 2012 - so many errors and yet instagram do not reply to my queries of requesting help All they care about is the professional accounts and as a personal account user they have forgotten about the little people all I want to do is use the app and want it to work properly - is that to much to ask? I dont think so Disappointed doesnt even cover it, and especially during a time of isolation and loneliness at an all time high and staying at home due to Coronavirus youd think they would allow the app to work for all of us"

I even created a new account you also disabled that one too. Does Instagram not want me to have an account at all? What gives?Update: I checked my account is completely gone Now my account just says instagrammer and as if my account never existed.

But I have noticed a lot of issues ever since I moved to iPhone from android. iPhone users need a better interface and bug fixing updates. Pls do something.

There is only minimum space to check what weve written-once you open camera on story and close it and come back to feed, camera will be still working in the background. We still see green camera light on top and this is you messing up our privacy and is illegal. And you never respond to our report on Instagram. I have sent n number of requests and screenshots but no answer at allThese issues are serious. Will you bother to do something about it please"

"really not a fan of new layout. I dont think anyone likes the new layout. I hate that theres reels which you CANT EXIT OUT OF, and theres a new shopping tab. Really instagram?? They already harvest all of our data, and now theyre literally shoving products in our faces?? And now all of the notifications and posting things are on the home page, but our profile is still all the way to the right? for me it feels like ive been moved so far away from my profile, which is what Instagram is supposed to be about. Change this stupid layout instagram, no one likes it"
"Buttons/links are misaligned in this version. This is a complaint about this version of Instagram but not Instagram in general. Clicking the more link to expand a caption continually pulls up a list of ppl who liked the photo as opposed to a continuation of the text. You have to really press it in exactly the precise location to get the text to show. Its super annoying. Even knowing I have to be extra precise takes me about 3 times before I get it right. Instagram, look at your user activity data, if you see a spike in multiple views of users who liked an image in a short amount of time, its bc you have some UI issues you need to reconcile"
trash. cant get the new features even if i have the latest update my other profiles were updated but my personal is stuck in 2012
"Hacked. Somehow someone was able to get into my account and my Facebook. They were able to change my name, picture, email and everything and me the actual person Cyndi B. Cannot get back in"
App Move Slow. Instagram is a good app. Dont get me wrong I love the app but it moves slower than all my apps and i have unlimited data. Please Fix This. And Update need to happen
"Newest update is horrible. Instagram decided to replace the notifications tab with a shopping tab. Way to sell out, IG. Will be uninstalling"
Instagram Quality. Ever since the newest updates.. when I try to post images on my personal account they end up very blurry but when I post the EXACT same image to my business account the quality is amazing.  need this fixed ASAP
Problems. Ive had instagram for a couple of years and now that I have a new phone and new number its impossible to login. Cant remember backup codes and it still has my old number attach to it so I cant even change the number to login. Love the security cuz my account was hacked Jan of this year. So if someone can help me recover my account that would be lovely
"Best social site. Its me Neha Rezwan. Being Fitnesses Enthusiast, Gym Girl, Personal Lifestyle Blogger &amp; Social Influencer Im gonna review Instagram as one of best social site "
My original page is Hacked. Iheartmedia corporate and myself has been waiting to for IG to send me my login information for months. Please help
Not getting any notifications. Hey Instagram team can yall help me out and let me know what I can do it get the notifications working again on my iPhone 11
"Poison. This app used to be good. But since the lizard person Zuckerberg took over, kiss your privacy and freedom of speech goodbye. "
Collecting information in term of verification. Trying to get more information about me. I dont want to give my phone number to verify my account through google voice. Not able to do so
No Reels option. It is really annoying that I have reels on my personal account but not in the business one.   Instagram has had plenty of time to activate this option on all the users accounts
"fix it . my insta has not been working for the best three days and i restarted my phone, deleted the app and logged out. I also tried it on wifi and mobile data and nothing is still working. Please fix this problem now"
"Lately its horrible. I think we need a new app with similar activities. IG became truly terrible. I have an account for work, I have a good growth and it keep blocking me saying I hired someone to get more followers, and at the same time blocks my personal account for the same reason. While my account is just for my friends. Other thing, it keeps pushing me to use some credit for promo (that I dont need as I have a good growth). Please make it what it was. Easy and friendly to use. I dont get all the need for this unnecessary inconvenience"
"Hacked. Am very disappointed, I provided instagram with all the information of who hacked me, somehow this guy was able to log into my acc, back and forth and beg my friends for money I reset my account 50 times but the hacker was still able to go and changed my password every time, after I threatened the hacked about turning him in to the FBI, the hacker was able to deactivate or delete my account, please someone tell me how this possible, my whole life was on there. I sent over 50 email including the hackers information but did they do anything no"
"Bad app all around. This app has a problem with silencing voices, most recently, Palestinian content. If that werent enough, their layout is difficult to navigate, they have no sense of privacy, and theyve become so concerned with making money they forgot their job is as a social media platform. You cant go anywhere or click on anything without the algorithm shoving buyable products down your throat"
"IG love. I love instagram and all of my followers. My journey on instagram has been like a personal time capsule. Its awesome, and I cant get enough of the memes or funny post my fellow peers share. Thank you for everything IG from the top of my heart"
"The new update is NOT GOOD. I have a personal and business account and now IG is posting everything to my personal and all my personal messages are in my business inbox AND when I got to report a bug it says &#34;error tap to try again&#34; and won&#39;t let me fix the bug.I&#39;m going to have to delete my personal account because logging out didn&#39;t work. Thanks for making a stressful week worse, IG"
Cant post from my second insta account. I can get in but any posts go my personal account
please fix the algorithm. im begging you to bring the old feed back. i wanna have at least the option to see newest posts first. the way you guys just keep famous people at the top i barely even see my personal friends stuff anymore its annoying and i miss the old instagram and everybody feels the same way
"id rather be on tiktok. swapping out my notifications for your shop feature ? thats sneakyinstagram is just a sales platform, data mining whatever it can, no ones actually making thoughtful and fun content on here anymore. everyones got an agenda"
Hey. With the new update the log out is no more.?Heyyy i dont see the add yo yout history option on my accouny? And i do really use that a lot why did you guys remove it.. i need it back..... is not the same even my pictures on my profile i cant share on my history.. 
Cannot start a conversation in messages. I love Instagram and have used it since it first came out. But currently Ive had problems where I couldnt tag people but then I fixed it and now I have the problem where i cannot start a private message conversation with another page. Instagram is updated to the newest software and thats when it started happening. Also I cannot wait for the old algorithm to come back
Its wrong. Theirs something wrong with the app I hope you find a way to fix it because I liked this app a lot but its messed up completely youre app is the best their shouldnt be anything wrong with it instagram is a huge company that supplies so much to people on this earth the last thing that should be seen is glitching is your app being hacked ? Why ? Ive never seen this happen to this before Id be very sad to see you go hope you get back on track sooner than later
"Bug. Instagram WONT stop taking all its updates off . Every time I exit Instagram now , it resets . I mean ALLLL the updates be gone . Like its back to its old state  I need this fixed , I have a PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNT And also my filters dont be working . But I need this bug fixed for my professional account . If you are wondering its @syahmarieofficial and my personal accounts are @stay.livin.s and @itty.bitty.spamz"
I no longer have access to music. For some reason I lost access to the music on Instagram and now I have some boring songs that I dont even no. I switch to a personal account and it still doesnt work
Error. I logged out of my Instagram for personal reasons and now I cant log back in. My password is correct. It keeps popping up as an error message. I tried changing passwords. Having a link sent. Using Wifi. Using the browser version. Nothing works. I want my Instagram back
"Quality. Quality is a huge annoyance. Always decreases image quality. Also feel like theres a few bugs still around. I cant search any song at all on my second account (business account) for stories, I can only choose from the few browse options- but my personal account I can search"
"Always hacked. App doesnt respect privacy, always asking for updates every 2 days, and hacked from Ucrânia and Poland"
Repost in stories. I wish personal accounts could share posts in stories
Loving IG. Its been fun and easy to use and lots of good information imparted
"Update Oddities. My friend got an update before me, said update encompasses chat color changes. I simply wish to know why some people get updates before others.ALSO STOP HARVESTING MEH DATA"
"Multi accounts insanely annoying. Ive been using instagram many years. I run a few small businesses. I hate that none of them ever have the same features. In particular saying reels is the big new thing, and not allowing all accounts access, is very unfair to their reach and platform. All my accounts except my main business had access to reels eventually. Still waiting for that last one. Gaining no traction. For people who pay to use the ads and also attempt to sell products directly on instagram, giving them money also, it has been nothing but stressful. Just had it updated today, and surprise, now ALL my accounts except personal lost access to reels. The updates need to be consistent for all accounts at once, or some predesigned and shared method other than just because so were not anxiously waiting to get on board before its too late "
reels will never be tiktok. well theyve finally turned IG into Facebook with More Pictures - I deleted my personal account and will likely transfer my business over to TikTok since thats where the real traffic is anyway 
"Ads?. Now you have to watch an ad when you choose continue watching of a video? Common now, isnt there anything we can do without having ads?"
Mmm NO. These new terms and conditions are straight up garbage. Completely violate allll of your privacy for no reason at all. Go to Parler or MeWe
Suggestion. There should be profile with both the options for public or the private post in one single account Like the account is private but there is a picture I want to post public without actually doing my hole account public just the post should have an option for the publicThat would be great to have a single account with both options for every post
"Please fix this problem. I tried to login to an old account for this group Im in (before getting the new updated account login info). And since this was not my account with my personal info, it said the login was suspicious activity and to send a code to the cellphone or email listed. I do not have access to these and could not login. However even after deleting and reinstalling Instagram several times, this account I tried to login and failed, still shows on my list of accounts. And when I click on it, it goes straight to the suspicious login activity detected page. How do I delete this from my list of Instagram accounts?"
Useless. I tried logging into my account and I forgot my password so I used Facebook then it said my login attempt was suspicious and I dont have access to the email or phone number linked to the account and there is no other way to get help. Their support is terrible
"New layout. I dislike the new layout a lot. I have several insta pages, a personal one and a few business ones and having the inbox icon at the bottom is so inconvenient. I also prefer to be able to access the page likes/loves from the bottom bar. Having it up the top means it is only accessible from the main feed. Worst update yet"
No Customer Support. For some odd reason my account was blocked from liking or commenting on anyones post. Every time I try I get a message saying link not allowed this is odd since I havent posted any links whatsoever on my account. After trying to track down an actual human being with no results I got tired of being locked out of my account with no way to fix it. So I deleted the account and from now on I am using an app with better privacy standards and actual customer support
"Sticker music error. good night instagram is a good application because you can put music in your stories you can post photos of your past and instagram is a very quiet app and there an error that has been happening to me a few days ago create a company account and create a Facebook page  from company and link my account where I had the company link my Facebook account to instagram and when I make a story and put the music sticker I don&#39;t get the music I want I get strange music and when I look for the song I don&#39;t get the  song then I tried to clear the instagram cache memory by removing the app I reinstalled it I changed my company to my personal account and my personal account I have private and then I removed my Facebook account that was linked to instagram and also in Facebook delete  permanently my company page and turn off my phone delete the application again i went back to doing a story after i delete all that and i still can&#39;t put music i get  music that I do not know please I ask you I need you to fix my account please because due to this error I can not do more stories with music, Thank you and good night"
"IG hacked. Unfortunately my IG Acc got hacked 3 days ago and IG has not yet closed my acc so that who ever hacked IT wont keep posting things.  This is very frustrating and scary, this person has access to all my personal things and regardless of all of my friends reporting my ACC they still wont take it down.  Therefore I wont be getting another acc if you guys arent able to keep us safe. IG doesnt have a customer services phone line, how is that posible. They got a number that directs you everywhere BUT to speak with someone. I also tried emailing and NOTHING. SMH, thanks IG, very disappointed"
Tips. -you need to maybe scan comments on posts before allowing it to be posted because most comments are arguments -you should add a button in privacy setting where u can prevent certain people from tagging you in posts
"The new update. Instagram just recently updated the app and I personal find it hideous. They are trying to copy ticktock and Im not able to see any other post (other than reels). I can only see those if I follow accounts.I really, really hate the new update"
"Blurry stories. I have used Instagram for years now and its a great app, but recently they have not updated the app and it keeps on blurring all of my stories. I have tried  everything to fix it including the hight data usage thing but its still the same and its really annoying. It completely messes up the photo. It will be really good if they can fix this issue, I hope they will fix this sooner"
"Inconsistencies across  accounts. I have three accounts- one for a business I run with a friend, a personal one, and a teacher one (so my students can find me but its just school stuff). The issue is each one looks different and the ones I actually want to use reels with (teacher and business account) dont have reels. What gives? Ive reported this glitch for months after being bored just waiting for the update and no one has gotten back to me- not even an automated message. For the love of all that is social media, PLEASE fix this glitch And please help me I want to use your platform but at this point Im debating just abandoning Instagram for my business account and just switching to tik tok because I cant compete with reels with just posts and stories anymore"
"Frustration with Instagram. Instagram disabled my account for no reason and now i cant get it back, because it gives me an error and says my email and login do not exist. I had this account 7 years ago. I am very sad and frustrated, because I have many photos and videos of my wedding, a memory with my brother who passed away in 2016 and I don&#39;t know what else to do. I already filled out some forms, but Instagram did not return. My account was private and personal with only 360 followers. I never violated any terms"
"cant share posts to story. I have multiple accounts for various reasons. Fan accounts, personal, photography. And only my personal I have an issue with sharing posts to my story. Ive googled what it could be and have done everything suggested. I dont understand why I dont have the option to share any Instagram post to my story?"
"please return my personal account. my personal account suddenly was disabled ...Id :94mahsa94... Unfortunately, I have emailed Instagram several times, but to no avail"
notifications not working. so i been using instagram for about 5 years and i never had this problem until recently. i get no notifications from the app at all. even for the dms. i deleted the app several times and trying logging on my ipad and it worked perfectly fine. i received all the notifications on it but when i tried on my phone it didnt. i switched my phone but im still not getting any of the notifications
"Security Breached. My account has been hacked for several weeks. I have reported this to meta within 5 min off hack.Currently still no access to my account. The hacker has been trying to scam my friends and family with crypto schemes, Ransoms for my life, Im stuck with a flat tire and my phone only text.. all kinds of cringy ish.. be careful with ig I may. An Lenny other accounts very soon. Sad this is the world we live in now"
This app spies on you. Im not talking about cookies ... it literally listens to you through your phones mic. Shady shady. Delete
"I hate the new update. Hey im Diamond, and I came here from TikTok, where I found out about the new update and i hate it, theyre literally MINORS on the app and you guys still grouped up with the government and now you guys have access to our privacy such as our location, credit card info, photos , and so on...this is NOT okay even though you have 12+ on ur age rating does NOT mean that there are NOT little freaking kids on there. ANDD also there have been glitches so if ur team can be helpful for once and fix it that would be great."
"Horrible account center: paradox city. If you want to disable your account you need to go on to the website. But if you want to reset your password youll have to do it on the app. Oh, but that only logs you in, and doesnt actually allow you to reset your password. Try deleting the app and the link to reset your password is goneNot going to even talk about the new horrible melding of Facebook and Instagram. Everything has to be one seem less universe, you cant have separations, privacy, personality, just one meaningless blog of information to be endlessly linked and marketed towards"
"Cant see who likes my post. It shows me how many likes My I have on my posts but not who liked them, I can see who liked my post on my band page but not on my personal Im very confused"
"TRASH. I only have the option to take a picture on stories. I cant make a video, I cant add music, I cant use a filter.. I cant do anything?? I have a personal account and a photography account and both of them are regular ol account sad they both look different? The navigation is different for both of them. What the heck? Come on now. This is ridiculous. Updates are supposed to UPdate it not downgrade it"
My previous account hacked. Attn: Instagram staffIts a shame no one helped me out to gain back access to my hacked accounts. Any help ? Thanks917-500-0080
My account was COMPROMISED wrongly. Main questions: Will I lose everything and will I ever be able to get Insta back ? INSTAGRAM PLEASE GET BACK TO ME.Situation:So I have many accounts on Insta Ive changed passwords before and shared my usernames before and how my accounts look but Ive NEVER SHARED ANY of MY PASSWORDS TO ANY OF MY ACCOUNTS TO ANYONE yet I saw a message that my accounts are compromised is this is an effect of me spam messaging because if someone even reads the messages its clear NONE of my virtual data was disclosed other than my name and gender Im wondering if I possibly got hacked
Love. I&#39;ve had this app since I was in 5th grade. It&#39;s incredible I just wish I&#39;m not able to see the amount of likes I get. Not sure if it&#39;s a rumor or there&#39;s an update for that. Love you instagram 
The add yours story feature. Mine got removed and I dont know why. I googled to see why and it said to clear my cache and data or to update that app and I that so why dont I have the feature anymore. I see everyone elses on their story but I cant use it. Please fix it ASAP
"Too many scammers on here. I really like the app, but Im tired of all the fake accounts trying to get personal information from me. Theres no really good way to report them, all you can do is block them. It gets old after awhile"
"I cant log back in my account. Very upset at the fact that I have my password to my account, but I must have put two factor authentication but there should be some way I can get help to get back in if I dont have access to the phone I used and my email is the same story as instagram. I was in an accident that caused me to lose access to my phone completely, now Ive been so long without being able to log in those old important accounts and no help to sign in , again I dont have the phone I used"
Hi. Looking forward enjoying what I do on instagram and to have a good amount of people who like and enjoy what I post its incredible and I love it Byeee
"Hate. I loathe the new update that shows suggested posts with my personal feed. I do not want to click to see old pictures and if I want to see more, Id use the explore Please revert back"
Please view as a improvement recommendation. Ive been using this app for a while now and I love it since I met dear friends of mine on it. But I would love the option to be able to look at old direct messages that go months back without the hassle of scrolling and draining my data
My account was hacked. Ive been trying to get my account back for the last 3 days and i did a video confirmation and yall couldnt confirm it like ive had that account since 6th grade all of my friends and family on there. Yall have to do better with the app security. most of the people know how i feel abt accounts getting hacked there is no reason for yall to just sit around and ignore this. I even called the support number and they couldnt do anything because u know why?? they dont answer with phone service
"Taking too long to take down abusive accounts. My work, personal, partners and boss accounts have reported an extremely abusive and threatening account . They have sent death threats and used words and images that should be flagged instantly on this app. Yet the account is still active"
Not so much fun anymore. Not so much fun anymore. They censor everything but at the same dont censor certain people. They are looking peoples dms there is no privacy. It should be fun for adults as well as everybody else
"Unable to function. I just regained access to my account after realizing someone had hacked my account and changed the password. I noticed a hack may have occurred after seeing multiple accounts in my feed that I had never personally followed. I had to completely restart my account and update my password. The issue now is that Im unable to like or comment on any accounts. An error message pops up saying Try again later. We restrict certain activity to protect our community. I have updated my account, deleted/re-added the app, and restarted my phone. Help please Ive sent multiple requests for help"
"Cant add posts to stories. instagram is great, but on my 2nd account i cant add posts to my story. it doesnt work for any account at all, so its not just their privacy settings. i can post on my main account, but not this one"
Sharing posts on stories. For some reason I can not share peoples posts to my stories. I have two accounts and personal one and a well-being one. On my personal I cannot repost someones stories but on my well-being one I can  Dont understand why and looking at all settings nothing is different between the two account I have Not troubleshooting is helping sort this out either. Instagram sort this out
"Dont sell your soul - Do Not Download. Seriously, read the agreement. They will track you on every level. THEY WILL READ YOUR PRIVATE TEXT MESSAGES  Dont do it"
"Super super slow story uploading and constant privacy agreement pop up message. I have always loved Instagram but lately its just super slow Whenever I tried to upload a story, it takes like literally 30 seconds to load my photos. And Im using the newest iPhone X pro. I just cant believe the app can be this slow. Please fix this. I would really appreciate it. Thanks"
"New update created a bug. My app updated yesterday and now my insights data is incorrect. It no longer shows data for the last year, only the last 3 months. Everything was accurate until this update. Fix this, please"
"I cant log back into my account. I cant log into my account because I created the account before my phone got stolen, when I received a replacement phone I got a new number. So when I try to log back in through phone number it sends it to my old phone. Also if I try to login with email I cant because I have a new email and cant remember which email I used for the account. Instagram wont show me what email I used to set up my account I know this is for privacy reasons but it is really frustrating Instagram is a great app, but I cant get my account back. If there is another way to log back in PLEASE let me know"
"Cant Share To Story. I have always been able to share stories on my personal Instagram @owenc_33 , however now I suddenly cant. The button for it just doesnt show up. Its been extremely frustrating"
"The music is acting up. Beforehand,I could look at all of the music I like and use it on my story or posts,and I could save popular music from reels. Now they put some music that is not only nothing that I like but I cant even use my saved music because its glitched and it only uses original audios instead of actual songs. At first they took away my normal music,now theyre taking away the way for me to save good music and keep my ACTUAL saved music. Please fix this. Also,the amount of security on this app is severely lacking,and Im wondering if I really do have any privacy at all"
"Cant see the number of likes on other Instagram posts. I have two accounts, one is an art account and the other is a personal account and neither of them are private. I cant see how many likes the people I follow have on their posts on my personal account and I find it extremely annoying"
friends i tagged cant reshare my post. I ve changed privacy settings but the issue isnt fixed pleasefix this ig team :)
"No notifications. Ive been experiencing this problem for 2 years now. The app refuses to send me notifications. Ive done everything. Checked both the app and phone Notification Center, allowed background refresh, deleted and redos loaded the app, logged out, turned my phone off, and more. Whenever I try to contact someone, it simply says to go to their frequently asked questions on their website. I use Instagram for my business, so this is entirely unacceptable and inconvenient"
"Dear Mark Z. I just dont understand your personal participation in the electing and the possible RE-election of president trump  Its truly nauseating and sad how something fun like Facebook, which I went off of, and Instagram, which seems more positive and upbeat, can turn into something dark and supportive of a classless individual who is completely corrupt....;(("
Notifications not working. I just recently got a new phone and downloaded instagram and Im not getting any notifications for it at all I already deleted it and downloaded it but still now working. I restarted my phone as well to see if it was a iPhone system problem but still messing up. I checked the Instagram website and no reports of this
Worst app in history. Worst app ever. I got my account stolen and Instagram never helped me or couldnt even write me back at least letting me know if I can get it back or not. Screw you instagram. Worst app Ive ever downloaded and I mean it
New update sucks. I hate this new update I cant go to access data anymore on a phone it has to be on computer very frustrating
Hate it here. Had my account for over 10 years and now its tracking my every move Now I cant even post anything without this stupid annoying error message popping up every time I sell my business on ig Like come on What is going on. Its really making me mad
"Closed my travel account for no reason. You guys closed my travel account for no reason without warning and cant get my data back. You dont respond, and provide ZERO SUPPORT Give me my content back"
"Deleted. Whatever update you guys just did makes it impossible to remove my phone number from the app, and when I add a second number, I never get the confirmation texts, cant progress past that screen, and now the entire app wont function because its stuck on the other phone number. Your app is trash if you force people to enter their phone numbers. Some of us dont want to be found with our phone numbers, no matter how much you say your privacy filters protect us, they dont"
People suggestions on my profile page????. How intrusive can the developers get? First you bombard the main page stream with adverts and empty headed profile suggestions and suggested pages. But now youve inserted suggested people on the top of my own profile page How gimmicky and desperate can you get Youve turned my personal profile into an advert
Frightening. No privacy on this app Make sure you read terms and conditions. Fix it. This app is not what it used to be :/
Not too impressed. Why is it that when Im on cellular all the stories and everything with the app works perfectly but when Im on wifi the app lags huge So not liking this app on wifi. And when on cellular it chews up all my data. Can someone explain this to me please?
"The worst update ever. I cant imagine running a company like Instagram and deciding to add a bunch of updates that make it so much worse, visually unattractive, and more cumbersome, which is what just happened.  Videos and Reels look awful, they cant be saved in categories anymore, you have to click a pull down menu at the top to save things now and scroll to select that option, it doesnt give you the option to save to multiple folders anymore, and the text and comments now appear over the actual video images. It is awful. If we wanted Tik Tok, wed be on that app instead of Instagram.  What an incredible downgrade for users. And also, quit trying to tie my Facebook and Instagram accounts together. What a mess"
My account is hacking. But no one help in instagram.incHacker changed register email and phone number. Instagram never reply my email
"awful. its no secret that an app made my a rich billionaire company wont care about accommodating to their users, but this point still stands. put feeds back in chronological order. people will unfollow the posts they dont want to see. bring back the feed past two weeks. refresh reflex causes people to miss out on posts that they may want to see. the name change update isnt DID/OSDD friendly. nobody wanted that. make chat themes a personal user setting. allow users to blacklist tags. put the like and create post buttons back where they used to be"
"IG wants to be a shopping mall so bad. The updates for the last couple of months are actually disgusting. Targeting peoples pockets with such an increase of ads during a pandemic is the worst kind of capitalism on an app that was started for PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR LIVES. While I understand that IG has grown as a platform since its origin, the inclusion of reels and this shopping tab just has no purpose for the majority of people. I know they have data that shows how many people are actually using this function yet they refuse to remove them. I deeply hope that someone comes and creates an app that isnt all about those who can pay to get to our subconscious because thats all IG is. So disappointing. Id give it negative stars if I could at this point"
"Great app just asking a question. This app is amazing where me and my friends can communicate you can post (on a public of private account). You can also have multiple accounts Which is what my question is about, me and my friend have both made a business selling key rings (not selling to people we dont know) and we cant make or see reels which is really annoying Thanks if you read this and I definitely recommend getting this app :D"
Its trash now. Why I cant see peoples like but in my second account I can see the number of the likes ? Either hide it for everyone or give us an option if we want to keep likes or comments shown. Also I hate the Banner the person sent you a Messagei cant see what the person sent me unless I click on the chat everything taking too much data to load
shitty app. blocks important information
"Wont load anything. For the past 2 days, Insta wouldnt refresh or load any co tent regardless of wifi or cellular data No other apps are having trouble, so it is not my phone or connection"
"Profile removed?. I had an account with two profiles. One for myself that I havent posted on in a while, and another for my dog so obviously met all the guidelines. I went to check Instagram today and my personal account was no longer paired"
"Will not send me verification code. Instagram keeps logging me out of all my accounts, then wants me to verify to have access. Yet, they never send me the verification code or link to my phone number that I signed up with. I am so over this app. Horrible customer service"
"Sharing posts to story - IS NOT WORKING. As of about four days ago I was able to share posts to my story and am now unable to do so. I have reached via the help section in settings and reported the problem and have yet to receive feedback. The app is updated and I went as far as reinstalling, too. I have a business page, would love to get better feedback and a timely response as to why this is happening. I have confirmed with other users that this is something particularly happening to my page. Apparently, the app is infamous for  turning off  features as they please? To conclude, I had no issues with the app until this CURRENT issue surfaced, and its odd. I have a business page, and Im a super low key individual who was hesitant with making an account in the first place due to my own personal beliefs in regards to social media.Instagram, just fix it plz"
Best app. A way to make friends am a YouTuber names freedom_phoenix and I say this app is my personal favorite app
"Notifications not working. The only app Im not receiving notifications from on IPhone XR. Tried everything suggested. Installed app 4 times, updated phone software, restarted phone 8 times, turned app notifications on, do not disturb is off, silent mode is off... No red app badges, no sound alert, no banners, no lockscreen notification... Still nothing. And Instagram doesnt have a support system to help you directly. Maybe one of the worst company help department on the planet. No contact information to help"
"Security issue. I received an email showing that instagram got a request to reset my instagram password, but the fact is I have never requested. I tried to see how people can request to reset the password, and I found that if you want to reset the password unless you have to logged in to the account, is that mean my account already being hacked? Is someone sign in my account in other place? I already set the two-factor authentication, But the problem is there is no login code sent to my phone and no new device show on the login activity?"
"Annoyed. Im so annoyed because I recently opened another business account, and I cant do any give aways or promote my business because I dont receive any @ mentions notifications. I messaged Instagram couple of times now and have not yet got a response. I feel like Ive tried everything and still cant figure out why. I compared it to my personal account (where I get all kinds of notifications) and still nothing. Someone please help me. Till then Ill give this app 5 stars"
"Cant share business story to personal page. I have a small business page on IG, but I cannot share my businesss IG stories to my personal story. I can share others IG stories, but not my own businesses. I have checked all my settings and cannot figure out why"
"Missing Features. I always loved using instagram, but for some reason all of a sudden my share post to story feature has been missing. But only one my personal/main account, and not my other. this is extremely upsetting and I havent received any help solving this issue whenever i reached out to instagrams support"
locked account. locked me out of my personal account that I had over 5 years  And they havent contacted me back on how to get it
"Buzzkill for artists. This app is trying to become tiktok, and now the only accounts that benefit from it are ones that pay to get promoted, have thousands of followers, or post a lot of reels. Whats worse is that most reel related content is literally just reposts of tiktok videos We dont use Instagram to see tiktok vids, we used it for its ability to share pictures Not to mention that on top of all of this, its swamped with bots, scammers, and ppl that steal art This app gets hella money, Im sure it can afford a way to prevent theft of intellectual property, art, and other sorts so why doesnt it. Its so hard to get posts or accounts taken down when they steal even if you are the artist in question"
"Damien March hacked and no support. Disgusted been on this ap for 6 years , built up 22k followers and a big art business @damienmarch . All got hacked changed email, deleted phone number and identity stolen. Instagram allowed this to happen within 5 mins and now just sends back email go to support pages . THEY DONT WORK have taken up a report with aust govt how this cyber hacking was allowed to happen and no REAL support is offered -ABSOLUTE DISGRACE"
"Annoying. Very annoyed that even after all this time the Reels feature has been rolled out that I STILL dont have the feature on my account. Tried updating, changing the type of account (personal, creator, business) and contacting Instagram STILL NO REELS FEATURE. I just wanna grow my account but if I cant use the tools every other creator is given how is that fair? No app equity whatsoever"
Hacked page. I Camille Wallace is texting to let you know that someone else is using my page the picture is with me in a camouflage outfit by a shower curtain is a universal shower curtain its purple someone else is using my page it is heck You need to delete that page people are taking people pictures and using and making pages they also hacking other pages didnt need the page with me in a camouflage outfit by a shower curtain which is purple with the universe on it
"Not able to share my post to my stories. I have reported this issue multiple times with no response. I have a personal and business page - the personal page I am able to share mine and others posts to my stories. But I cant do the same for my business page. I am an iPhone user and it seems as though theres no way to fix this. I have the most updated version, but still no change. Please help"
"No Messenger. I cant get those features on my account. I updated it, restarted my phone, cleared the data, uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and signed out/in of my account, I got the notification and updated it, but it didnt work. I tried everything... Somebody help me"
"Cant log in. I just got a new phone and my IG account is linked to my Facebook. Well when I hit the option to log in through my Facebook and continue as Haven Jones, it keeps telling me there was a problem processing my request. Am I going to have to make an entire new account?? I dont have access to the email account so I guess Im screwed"
"Works half of the time. When this app works properly, its great. But put stupid updates, the app crashing every other week and it constantly going back to older versions and its simply terrible to use. Also both of my accounts are constantly getting hacked even with a good password, Facebook has a horrible firewall and this is really a shame. Why cant we go back to the goold days when this app was simple and actually worked properly"
"QVC?. instagram the new qvc. we know you love spying on us and listening to our conversations but just stop, this aint it. app is absolute trash. no one wants to buy the junk youre hawking"
"My instagram music is broken. Ever since i had my business account i would add music but now its just Russian music. I would search up a song, it would pop up but its not there. I am highly confused. I am not back on my personal and its still the same. Ive googled it but it was a dead end. When i post pictures it gives my pictures more element and i would like to have that back but i dont know how to. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME FIX IT"
Deleting personal videos. I really think that it is wrong to delete good memory of users just because they have a piece of music that they like. I understand it is not their own but the idea is that we enjoy it and use it for fun and not profit
Hacked. Me and my friend got hacked within two days and it is sending every body ( hey I made this with ur photo in this u better love it)
locked access. my account says locked but when it gives me the two options those are my old information I have a new email and a new phone number so I dont know how to get my account back when its false information now
Security Problems. Locked me out of my account because they suspected it was being hacked. I dont have access to my old phone number to enter the verification code and unfortunately they offered me no support. Now im locked out of all of my personal information and they wont do anything to help:/
"Hacked and the selfie video has been refused 10+ times. Hello, My account was hacked and I understand that there is a process to things, but the selfie video that I have submitted has been denied 10+ times. I remember when I used to post photos and that photo had bad lighting, crazy filters, and often not even focused, yet they were still able to recognize someone in that photo and suggest that we tag them. The fact that I have now submitted a selfie so many times and I have still been refused is absolutely crazy. You arent allowed to speak to anyone and the response doesnt mean that they will work with you, but they are actually giving you the run-around because you go right back to the beginning instead of them assigning someone to the case and trying to help you qualify for their standards. It baffles me that a company that is so highly revered and used can be so terrible when it comes to coming to the aid of its users. Absolutely atrocious and Im only hoping to get my account back so that the hacker doesnt have it and I can delete it. I get that one person means nothing to this big company, but I think there really needs to be something more than a you didnt meet our standards, try again. Actually help people"
My Instagram music is broke. I dont have the usual artists or songs on my suggested nor can I search them up. I think it was because I had a business account but I changed to personal and private and even deleted and reinstalled Instagram 10+ times and it still doesnt work. This is very annoying because I love adding music to my stories and now I cant
"MUSIC OPTION NOT WORKING. I do not have the music option when posting stories Ive done everything I tried to re-install, log out and log back in, change my account to personal, private, public and still nothing Ive tried to reach out to Instagram support last week and still no one has contacted me on the issue"
"Help Login issue. Ok, so, I love Instagram its so fun I have a personal and fan account. Theres so much to do on there and anyway its very good HOWEVERRRR I have a login issue When I try to login it says AsyncSocketException: recv() failed (peer DO YOU DEVELOPERS KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS If you do,  please reply to this Ive been logged out for nearly two months now, its unacceptable Ive tried: turning my phone on and off again, deleting the app and reinstalling it, updating the app, clearing my storage, etc it just wont work I have an iPhone by the way. Please please please help me Thank you :) But Instagram is an amazing app its a great  way to share creativity and love yourself Its very fun to go live as well and theres lots of things to add to your story, but DEVELOPERS- PLEASE REPLY TO THIS Thank you for reading "
"Overdue on way to delete/edit in multi-pic post. Users have been begging for years to be able to edit or delete single photos from a multi-pic post after its been posted, without having to delete the whole thing and start over, just to remove one pic from the series. Why is this not being made a priority? Instagram keeps developing updates to facilitate more in-app shopping but in terms of its classic use for uploading photos theyve kept it very user unfriendly"
GOOD. I love it soo much but when you have a different account or like a spam account please dont make the notifications loud when your on the app Thank you
"Version 164.0 is the worst UX update made to Instagram. We all kind of got used to Instagram becoming more and more commercial with a strong focus on monetisation of literally everything. However, the latest update 164.0, where youve given such a priority to shop and moved likes and add new to the right top corner, is just terrible. You collapsed that so much that I barely hit the right icon from the first trial. And seriously, reels in the middle of the handy bottom bar? Guys, we dont need another WeChat with such a plenty of features that even devs do not know them all. We just want our good old Instagram where people share pictures, not make the bloody business first"
"Someone hacked my account to sell fake crytpocurrency and I still haven't received any help. Hello Instagram It has been over a month since I have been hacked logged out of my original Instagram account @Brianna_Fogelson (Anne Hathaway doppelgänger). Although I've emailed the help center numerous of times, I still have not received any help. Please redirect somewhere you can help or get whoever hacked into my account banned.Thank you,Brianna fogelson"
Not working Right. For the past two days IG app has been throwing me off I use the business one and when I click on my picture to go to my personal it just goes black -blank can you assist me with this matter
"new reshare feature. I have a personal acc, spam acc, &amp; business acc. Only on 2 of my accounts do I still have the option to add someone elses post from my feed to my story, but on one account Im required to use the Reshare feature and this drives me crazy. I feel like its a whole extra step for what? &amp; the fact its only on one of my accounts and none of my friends instagrams are doing this annoys me more"
"Terrible new update. Shopping where the notifications used to be? I think not. Reels in your face at the bottom? I think not. PLEASE get our priorities in check, Instagram. Nobody wants this"
Amazing app do get. Great for privacy and funny post after a long day 
My Account has been Stolen. Weeks ago someone took total control over my Fern_Hill_Orignals account along with all my photos. I complained often with absolutely no response or results from Instagram. The hacker has been messaging all my followers trying to pull off the Google gift card scam. Its unbelievable that you Suspend accounts that share personal opinions and do nothing to the scammers that scam on a daily basis. I had to open a new account just to post my photos
"i have a problem that needs fixing. so basically you see i own a creator account that of course posts regularly but one day it stopped because i could post any videos, this problem is still up to this day and i cant post any videos, it says  sorry well try again when theres better connection even though the connection is perfectly fine and then it went from one account onto my personal account and my other accounts. i have send requests to help center etc multiple times and the problem still hasnt been resolved and i havent even got a reply. please fix this instagram, i want to be able to post again"
Problems with sharing to story. So I wanted to repost a photo to my Instagram story but the button for my story is not there. It only lets me share the story to my followers not the actual story. I have tried so many different things. Like turning my phone off and on I even re-download Instagram but the button is still not there. I have been getting really mad about this. Ive tried contacting Instagram but they are no help. I am not sure what else todo at this point. I just want to repost pictures on my story. APPLE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
"No support. If you ever face any issues with this app goodluck getting any support with your problem, Ive been constantly getting action blocked minutes after getting off another one despite never following anyone or liking photos. Theres no option for you to contact a support team to ever get help either so its either you make a new account and lose everything you have, or continue with a broken account to not lose your pictures and data"
My personal opinion. I think Instagram is great but I would love my reels to get shown more often
"Terrible customer service. Im having a problem with my account that is NOT a common issue, its not in the help center, Ive deleted the app several times and Im out of options. I doesnt make sense to assume everyones issue in the help center AND THEN when you try to report an issue all you get is a thanks for the feedback its not feedback, its an issue. My Instagram has been doing this weird thing where whenever I go to watch a video, the screen turns black but the audio plays. 6/10 videos I attempt each day do this. Its clearly an issue regarding MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT. Its not a bug in the whole app. I do have a second account that I use and the videos work just fine. However, Ive had my main account for 10 years and would like to keep it. PLEASE HELP"
I love the inst. There is a problem going on people are hacking into other people's accounts stealing other peoples account passcodes. Thank you God that has not happened to me I'm very careful what I open what I don't but if anybody knows about this if they could elaborate more and explain to me how is this going on so I could protect my family members that has got hacked and they stole money out of her bank account thank you and God bless you
"Hey. Its good and I love it, but earlier today it stopped letting me access my private messages. Im confused as to why and I cant access it online either"
Glitches. I just want to say that Instagram is the number one app if you want to message a guy. Especially if its a lengthy conversation. The liking feature is great and so is the way it just deletes paragraphs. Honestly I think Im in love with this app its so iconic. The way it glitches during important conversations just melts my heart. So yes I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a messaging app
"Cant share posts on story. Ive always loved using Instagram, its so easy and simple to use. I started posting and making friends on my new art account, when I found I couldnt share posts on my story.Eeeverybody else could, and I could do it on my personal account, but for some unknown ridiculous reason, it doesnt work on my other account. All the settings are the same. I made another account, just to see if I could share posts to my story, and of course, I could.People have been having this problem for almost a YEAR now. I want this fixed because its quite sad that I cant share the talents of other makers because of some fault in the app"
"Old person view. Dear editor.Ive only been here for 2 minutes- the complaint by the user/ request to return seems to me to be entirely reasonable.Are you listening?I began working in IT in the late 70s early 80s and have tried most things - what works is what adapts to the market its serving and what is upgradable.I would love to be up to date with all of the latest apps but I come from the days of LinkedIn and Facebook.You may be too late for the elderly market with Coronavirus wiping it out but now in my 64th year from my experience what success is people who get out there and try and people who listen to and respond to those who buy and use their products.SLOW DOWN, EXPLAIN CLEARLY &amp; SIMPLY.It is actually a given that most of us want to stay alive.We all have many persona and at least some need for privacy and confidentiality"
Terrible UI Update. I guess Instagram cares more about marketing products and selling stuff than the user experience of their millions of customers. Replacing the notification button with a shopping button???? I dont go to Instagram to shop . Did they run any tests with their UI devs? Why put the notifications at the very top? My thumb doesnt reach. What were they thinking.... 
Consumerism and Data Mining at its Finest. Very unhappy with this update. the new post button has moved completely and notifications have been replaced by shopping. disgusting
Trash. A garbage app from a garbage company with no respect for your privacy or your time
"Something I want you guys to see. This app is incredible,Its fun to save up memories, though sometimes it does give me trouble, when I first started this app I put my profile picture in, but it posted it as a regular photo. I tried to delete it but somehow I dont know how. So I think that a bug I want you to fix, but overall the app is wonderful"
"App keeps failing to post stories when I switch views. In the past month, Ive noticed that when I try posting stories and then switching cameras (back camera to front facing) the story tries to load and ends up in an infinite loop of loading. I cant even save the video, its just stuck and then I lose the video altogether. Also, Ive noticed that Instagram just fails to update sometimes in general. I get the notification that someone messaged me but the messages fail to load, even if I move from wifi to data.My iPhone 11 Pro Max is only at 30% storage use, Ive restarted the phone and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Im also always on the latest app versions. Facebook please do better"
"Story Music glitch. So instagram is only letting me add royalty free music to my stories on only ONE of my accounts. It was originally a business account but i switched it over to personal, nothing changed. This is my main account where I actually use this tool, for photo memories On my other account it works perfectly fine showing popular artists and all the music i would generally search for.. This is a problem Please fix it I&#39;ve tried quite a bit of things"
Account Deactivation. I should be able to deactivate my account more than once a week. I deactivated it once and had to reactivate to recover pictures and now I cant deactivate it again for another week. The reason I deactivated is because of a personal security issue and I need my account to be gone
the update is stupid and ppl get hacked. WHY ARE THE STORIES SO STUPID LOOKING I HATE IT ITS TOO MUCH ROOM AND ITS ON ONLY ONE OF MY ACCOUNTS STOP :( Just like I said so many people are getting hacked and those spam account that steal content without crediting is an issue too
Hacking. And cant get it back. Its crazy how someone can easily hack your software with out any info and you dont even have a Help/tech support/phone number or  a place to go to get real help from your in you just want us to keep Reading help center like thats gonna help a heck Victim.....I cant dont anything not I love friends all over the world and Business. Profit all because of something else actions and your weak fire wall.....and I cant even email you. Its so hard to get help your a be Company. Why do you not care about your tech-support
New account. My old account was hacked and I reached out to you all and still have not gotten a reply meaning I will not be getting my 4K followers back or any of my pictures
HACKED AND NO SUPPORT. My account was hacked and the Request Support does not appear as instructed in the faq. The account has personal pictures of me on it and I never received an email change email. I have not been able to reach anyone about this despite hundreds of attempts
"Temporarily Locked. Ive been having this problem since March 1, 2021 and its my account being locked. Ive contacted Instagram several times already to help recover my account because the problem is when I try to log in its asking for a 6 digit code to an email that I dont have access to. If I cant access the email linked to the account, theres a form that can help you and Instagram will contact you through another email you have, I filled it out, verified my identity, managed to change my password successfully, and my account is still locked. I dont understand, I verified my identity with a picture of me and my account information with a code you told me to take a picture of, managed to change my password after I verify my identity, and Im still locked? This doesnt make sense, I filled the form for a reason and its because I CANT ACCESS THE EMAIL. So how am I supposed to receive a 6 digit code if I cant access the email? I verified my identity several times and change my password several times and Im still locked out of my own account when I showed proof of me owning my account. I should be unlocked immediately after all that, it doesnt make sense"
"We need an update/fix. Notifications for multiple accounts is messed up, notifications (in general) are inaccurate, too. Can&#39;t share public IGTV posts made by other users to our personal story if the post has the preview feature enabled. Also, when using the music feature, posts are getting flagged &amp; blocked.There are so many issues with IG right now. But those two are bothering me the most"
"Easy to switch accounts but blocked from liking posts. I didnt mind the new update as I could switch between my personal and business account easier, plus the ability to set up a shop looks promising (havent tried it out yet). However, on my private personal account Im blocked from following and liking. Ive uninstalled and changed password but no luck. The only two things that seem to work are using the app via mobile data (somehow it doesnt like my WiFi even though I can like pictures from my business account via WiFi) or using it via the internet. I hope this bug is fixed soon - Im waiting for the new update before installing again"
"Sensored and Shut Down. On Feb. 6th, 2020, a hacker took over my account, Lori Lewis or Lorileighlewis, and changed the username to Stepfranck1They also changed the email address to i******o@o***.plMy daughter, Mabel Lewis and my friend Marjorie Secrest Reported the account as spam. Even though it wasnt truly spam.This account has years of my personal photos and comments from family and friends. I have filled out thisu form probably 8 times. Im always told to be on the lookout for an email from Instagram. I have yet to see an email. Please, for the love of all that is good, can someone help me get my account back?Is it because my account had years of conservative political posts???"
thankyou. I appreciate being able to spread my loving awareness and keep in touch with my loved ones thank you for making that possible. Improve privacy
Customer service really poor. I cant get access to my personal account through the app and no one is trying to help me about it
"Got hacked. Tons of bots and scammers always trying to slide into your dms regardless of privacy settings, got hacked and made it impossible to get my account back while I was at work"
Something is glitching. I haven&#39;t been able to re-post or reshare other people&#39;s in-feed posts to my own story in more than a week. I have already tried updating the app and my phone. I also tried logging out of my account and logging back in. I know for a fact that it isn&#39;t because of other people&#39;s privacy settings because they are all public. I really hope this bug gets fixed soon because it&#39;s irritating
"Deleted me account for no reason. After being on Instagram for over 7 years with the same account (a personal private account with less than a thousand followers) Instagram decided to disable my account out of nowhere and did not provide a reason why.  I tried to appeal the decision over 50 times, I got the emails with the instructions and code, but when I sent the email with the picture of me with the code, name, and username I never got any email back.  I gave up and made 3 new accounts, but all 3 accounts were also disabled FOR NO REASON.  Instagrams appeal process is a joke and does not work.  I also requested to download my pictures from my account since most of them I do not have on my camera roll and Instagram never sent me a download for them so now years of photos I will never ever see again.  Im done with Instagram"
"Not updating. On my personal account, I dont have access to certain things included in updates, including the recent add yours sticker Please provide assistance as my Internet is fine, so is my device, and there is no option to update on the App Store Help"
Hacked accounts. Two of my friends accounts have been hacked by people within 1 day.. I feel like when people report the account as a fake account/pretending to be someone else should really take in consideration and actually look into it with detail. I feel like as a company you are slacking at keeping our accounts safe and should have a verification code to access your account when logging it to be sure its the right person entering the account
"End the occupation, Free Palestine . But whatever they try Palestine will never die theyre the owner of the land and no one can take it from them  a stealer and oppressor will always support another stealer and oppressor this is how things work but believe you me we wont let go like really shame on instagram..... I cant even imagine how dishonest you are like how many people have rated you with one star where are the data? ..... Shame on you"
"I cant even access my other account. I am a social media intern and anytime I try to log into my work account my Instagram freaks out and doesnt allow me to switch between my personal and work account. It says that its limiting the number of times I can do certain things, and it freezes on that screen where none of the buttons work. This bug is really frustrating and completely discourages myself as a personal user and my employer from utilizing the app"
How to unblock when you both blocked each other. Instagram listen to this so me and my friend blocked each other for...reasons and we want to unlock each other but its not possible because when you click on there profile to unblock after you go to settings and then privacy it doesnt let us click on the profile
"Bad customer service WHEN ARE YALL THINKING OF FINALLY HELPING ME. Ive been trying to reach them for about over a month now, reporting my problem multiple times and no one has gotten in contact with me about it.  My Instagram seems to not send me any notifications even if they are turned on, they dont show up in my activity feed at all like if I dont have anything, I dont get dm notifications and I cant change my profile to private to see if that would do something Its so annoying They dont have a number or an email to reach them besides their help center but that doesnt seem to help whatsoever. Its just so terrible, my profile is a business profile so with that being said with this problem its affecting my business. This is nonsense and disappointing"
"Kicked out of my Business Account. Up until a few days ago I havent had any issues with this app. Im currently in the middle of a Valentines Day giveaway for my Etsy shop through Instagram and Facebook and it logged my out of Instagram on all my devices. Upon trying to log back in asks for my phone number. After I enter it, Im sent to a verification code screen, but countless times am never sent a verification code.Ive emailed and called for help with no response, and no way to get back into my account. It doesnt even ask for my email or another backup. The only way to get into my personal account is by uninstalling and reinstalling, otherwise it just switches back to the phone number screen"
"Constant Updates only Irritate. Guys, stop changing the UI. Youve had shop features and whatever the TikTok/Snapchat rip-off is for ages and no one cares. Why would you replace things people actually use and move them to inconvenient spots? Now the explore feed is unnecessarily nested under my regular feed, and even my regular need is NESTED UNDER ITSELF. Go back. I want to see posts in chronological order, uninterrupted by all caught up, heres the explore feed. I want my explore feed to be its own thing, so it doesnt get reset to the top if I go back to my personal feed, check DMs, or do anything else in the app. Nest the things people dont care about beneath things we actually want"
Incredible Social App. Have enjoyed the visual and social connect this app provides. Definitely a unique innovation with a flare for free forum organic engagement. A feast of eyegasms for sure

"Instagram is frustrating. I have been using Instagram since 2013 and recently I reported a account which impersonated me. My account got disabled permanently. I was furious for a few days and I decided to create a new account. Just when I was getting back on track with followers, my account is under review again and I know its going to be disabled again. I wont use Instagram anymore. There is no email or contact information when you really need them. Please fix it"
Latest Update. Everything about the latest update is a blatant attempt by this platform to increase advertising and take advantage of the data that the platform has collected on us to profit. Both reels and the shopping tab are unwanted additions by the far majority of users
"Updating IG loses IG story sharing. I rely on clients sharing stories with friends for giveaways, referrals, and ultimately booking an appointment with me.

Always I give this one star. About a week ago I tried IG again but I gotten rid of it as I dont trust the app because of privacy issues and noticed that there are still the fake actors accounts are still up on the platform of IG and I always getting  messages from to many lonely men who are only looking for a personal chit chat which I am not looking for those type account shouldnt be on the platform the developers of IG should have bottom asking what type of account. This app shouldnt have stayed as only a positive app to post photos not a stupid videos or live type photos I know that the developers wont do anything about fake accounts etc as there are all about the money

"Locked out of business account. I have written and reported a login issue numerous times since May when I had a phone number change from another state. My two step verification was on so I could access my personal account which had been hacked and all of my photos were erased, and I was completely locked out of the business account. I still have complete access to my personal account and can view my business account, but I cannot access the actual account. I get as far as logging in with the correct email, but the code is sent to the old phone number and I cannot get further than that. It's dissapointing that I am unable to have someone from Instagram  contact me after I have made numerous tremors to recover a business page"
"Instagram you disabled my main personal account. After I made a Valentines Day post Instagram deliberately disabled my personal Instagram account. I tried confirming that it was me, an error message pops up stating that I cannot even confirm my account. Please, give back my personal account cause I own other accounts and 3 of them including my personal account got disabled. I even created a new account Instagram also disabled that one too. Does Instagram not want me to have an account at all? What gives?Update: I checked my account is completely gone Now my account just says instagrammer and as if my account never existed. Now Im paranoid to even create a new account hence it will get disabled like the rest that I have made. This saddens me I have done nothing wrong to go against the Instagram violation terms and guidelines. All of my post memories and stories that Ive created with my personal account its all gone. "
"People Cant Re-Share Stories I Tag Them In. Starting about 3 months ago, I noticed people cannot re-post stories I tag them in. It used to work fine and then stopped for no apparent reason Ive been through all of the privacy/security/sharing settings and compared them with others I can share their stories but they cannot share mine. The app is updated. I cannot figure it out and it must be an issue on Instagrams end. Im beyond frustrated with the app"
HELP. Why is the quality of my pictures being reduced after uploading to Instagram? I use 2 different accounts (one personal and one for business). I only have this issue on one account. I feel like Ive tried everything
"Spam notifications. I get daily notifications with suggestions of people to follow and there seems to be no option to turn this off, terrible app"
Give an iPad version. Give me an iPad version. If I can pay a decent amount for 4g mobile data. You can make an iPad version
Disabled account for no reason. IG disabled my account for no reason. Personal account. Never any suspect activity or anything close to a violation of terms. Used to interact with family and friends. I posted a pic of the beach and my account was disabled with no way to get it back. A lot of memories gone. I hope a substitute app comes along and buries Meta
"App Is Too Intrusive. With the latest terms of service updates, Im done using this app. I dont trust this app with my data going forward"
"fix it. i love instagram i do- but i dont use it for all my shopping. i would like to have quicker access to my notifications rather then look at shops i wont buy for. make another place for shopping sure, but notifications should of stayed in their rightful place"
Login problems. I have had more than one instagram account logged in on my phone so i i wanted to log out them and get them off my login however everything i log out i go to the place where you switch accounts and the account still shows up and you can still access it even though i have logged out
"Great but my text sometimes doesnt show up. Good and fun iOS app but sometimes my text doesnt show up on my personal Instagram stories.Instagram developers, would you please fix this bug?Thank you and with gratitude,Nabil Bennett"
My Instagram was hacked and I have no help. A scammer took my friends account on Instagram and sent me a dm with a link when I clicked the link my email and password was removed from my account and the scammer turned on two step authentication after changing it to his own personal email. We never tried to illegally flip money or anything like that he used other people we knew to trick us and take the accounts . Instagram has no call service for me to verify my birthday on the account and get it back
CHANGE THINGS BACK. I dont like this new update There taking away things i liked like replying with a emoji &amp; freeze frame for stories &amp; I should be allowed to i update. And all these ads are aggravating and yall should stop app tracking me or whatever its weird I say something then it pops up as a ad 
"Endless spam. Im constantly getting notifications about who recently added to their story, etc. I. Dont. Care. who posted for the time in a while. Im getting like 10 an hour and it never stops"
"data cost or massages. data cost so much,and somitime sms sending slowly,data travle so many time.should be working and fixed the problems"
"Doesnt give access to reels to Everyone. I have had a personal account since 2010 and a business account for my artwork since 2017. I really liked the app and loved doing business on it. But lately the app has been favoring and pushing Reels, which would be great if I had access. In the past few months my business account has gone down in views because It doesnt have access to Reels. I cant post them and I cant watch them in full screen. I understand the app is free and offers a lot for businesses but when they dont make highly pushed features available to every account it becomes almost pointless so use the app. Though Im making better posts and frequently posting stories, I have very low views. I cant even work with the algorithm If I wanted to. I used to love this app, but lately I have found myself more frustrated and annoyed when engaging with the app. I have also reported my problem 7 times and no feed back. The Help section doesnt address it, theres now one to contact in the company and Ive already done all the trouble shooting ideas presented online. At this point Im just annoyed with the app"
Unable to edit my profile info. Not sure why but I havent been able to edit my profile or change my profile picture for months now. I keep getting the red error message and something went wrong and to try again. PLEASE update the app with the bug fixes. Other than that the app is wonderful. Just really bummed
"Still cant log in. After a week, i still cant log in using the app. Im still given a message stating ERROR. Sorry there was a problem with your request . Ive been forced to use my BROWSER in order to access my account.. please fix this. I really LOVE Instagram, its one of the only apps I use 24/7"
I dont know why is wrong with this app. It was working just fine this morning and then all the sudden I go on my app and it doesnt work took me two hours to post something and yet it still hasnt posted I dont know if its a bug or a or the app is  being hacked. I cant DM I cant post I cant like I cant tag I cant do anything theres something really wrong with this app I dont understand what is going on but I want it fixed now because Instagram was My favorite app until now I cannot get into my stuff I tried deleting The app its self nothing is working it wont let me log into my account now it tells me something went wrong when I know all my passwords to five of my accounts I have five accounts yes I Instagram really needs to get his crap together is aggravating me my videos and pictures wont send I cannot send any DMs  its really making me mad
MY ACCOUNT KEEPS GETTING HACKED. Am sure not having a good time here on Instagram. I have lost more than 4 accounts in the space of one year without sharing my account privacy to anyone. The security on Instagram accounts seems too poor and very annoying. Right now I just lost an account few weeks ago. still dont know how to get it back. Something should be done on this ASAP
"Fact Check. This review is just for the fact check feature. It is clearly politically biased and not that accurate; I go into deep research about what the reviewers describe as misinformation and they are clearly motivated by personal feelings. Also, it targets posts that are either obviously jokes. Remove the feature and replace it with an unbiased, factual one"
NOT ABLE TO LOG INTO MY ACCT. very frustrated because I cant login into my instagram account ive had for years I got a new phone number and it wants me verify my old number to get into the acct which I dont have access to it anymore I dont know who to contact or get help from. hoping my whole account isnt lost it would be nice if instagram had a contact number
"My Notifications Stopped. I use Instagram for social, for communication, and (to some extent) for business. A few weeks ago, my notifications just stopped working. I checked Instagram notification settings, everything looks fine. I check my phone notification settings, all good there. I delete and redownload the app to clear any corrupted cached data, but still nothing. I can find no clear reason or solution to this problem, and it means every time I send or receive a message or make a post I have to enter the app and search around to see what and where my notifications are. Its extremely inconvenient, and a problem that is not, unfortunately, isolated to this event as I know a few others with the same problem. Hoping this is resolved soon either in a new update or a spurt of technological genius on my part"
"No music option for stories. Cmon Instagram Give us back the option to add music to stories. I have 2 account, and in my personal account, it works just fine. On my business account, I no longer have the option. It stinks, as Id much rather have the music option on my business account where Im trying to draw traffic. Please give it back When you do, Ill restore my 5 star rating"
"Notifications only working for one account?. I have 2 IG accounts. A personal one and one specifically for my wildlife photography.For some bizarre reason, since I updated the app the other day, I no longer get updates for my second photography account (the one I use the most). So what have you done to screw up the notifications? I can see Im not the only one with this issue, so do hurry up and get it fixed. In fact while were on the subject of notifications. Are you ever going to include badge notifications for likes and comments? Having badge notifications for messages only, is pretty annoying"
"Cant Share Stories - Help. I have been using instagram for 10 years and never had a problem, until now where I am not able to share posts to my stories.Im a photographer and it is essential i&#39;m able to share my colleagues post to my story for engagement and interaction to both mine and their accounts. however, now it isnt even an option (on both my personal and business account).Ive reported the problem through the app twice and still two months later it has not been fixed. Any help to fix the problem will be very much appreciated"
"My Instagram DMs arent loading. my instagram stopped displaying new messages from group chats or personal chats in the Instagram app. All my chats are gone from the main DM screen, I have to add them back manually using the search bar. I still receive notifications from IG on my phone when someone messages me, but they do not show up in the app. I can still send messages to other people, and they still receive them. I just see them typing and the messages never come back"
Account Randomly Deactivated. I was using a personal account when I got an error message that made me confirm I wasnt a robot and the phone number I use for the account. I followed the prompts and now apparently I have to wait 24 hours with no chance to appeal or contact Instagram. I dont know what happened
"Getting worse. This app is getting worse it doesnt let me access my music and when it does, its the wrong type of music and no results pop up when I search for them. Also theres many accounts that are getting hacked and many have been accessing their pictures and that invading privacy and its not good for the app  also"
"Glitch?. On one of my accounts it completely logged me out, when I logged back in the whole account was wiped. My bio and pfp were my old ones and all my followers,following,posts,dms,highlights,data everything gone. The only indication it wasnt a new account was that it said created in February. I dont know if this is some type of glitch or if I was hacked? I tried contacting Instagram"
"Video Call Failed??. Ive always used video call with direct messaging through Instagram and loved it , its always worked perfect for me until now for some odd reason.  Ive tried rebooting , uninstalling , clearing  data.  Im not sure what the problem is but its making me upset :("
Cringe data stealers. What it says on the tin
"New update. With every update you either move one step forward and two steps back, or two steps forward and one step back Its getting annoying You should continuously change/add skins, and allow us to keep a skin we like instead of going back to the original icon. Issues with having multiple accounts I.e personal and businesses. You seem to never get the balance right, and its frustrating"
"My big account was hacked and is now FOR SALE. With ABSOLUTELY no help from Facebook or Instagram. I did everything possible to reach out, filled out the form for hacked accounts, was contacted and yet told they cant help. I have the original email. I can prove I am myself. But now its too late. The hacker put my account up for sale and deleted 9 years of content. I was a positivity blog, a place I used as a trauma survivor to help my own mental health as well as uplift others. It was taken and all deleted like none of it mattered. I have several friends with big accounts who have seen all this, tried to help, and are now thinking of leaving Instagram as well. I will tel everyone I meet not to trust this website. All those memories, gone. My identity, being used to try to scam people this whole past month. I am SICK of it. The stress of it on my PTSD & bipolar put me in the hospital last month. THANKS INSTAGRAM"
"Cannot repost post. I do not have the option to repost other peoples posts. Still waiting for it. Updated the newest instagram version and everything and still the same. Everyone else around me has it. However, when I created my new business account that is linked to my personal account, the option is available for my business account. Confusing and fustrating as to why this is"
Bleh. The app is cool and all but yall seriously always have bug issues. I have an up to date phone so it&#39;s frustrating to constantly open the app and something is glitching. Also I&#39;m a business owner so that&#39;s added frustration. I will also add that I am not a fan of the algorithum. It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense and it has turned the app into a popularity contsest for many young people my age. And my last complaint right now is how only people with a certain amount of followers are able to add links to their stories. I&#39;m talking influencer status. And as a business owner and a personal consumer I&#39;m not happy about any of these things as it prevents me from properly utilizing and enjoying the app. I miss when it was more simple
My notifications are not working. It&#39;s been a month now and my notifications for Instagram simply refuses to show up. I checked all my settings and all my seetings seem to be right. However i cannot see the messages i receive on the app till I open it. Help
"Hi. I have a question, I changed my personal account to business account, but I still can not use the theme and replay options directly, How can I use them?"
"Action blocked. Yep, another comment on ig blocker team being trigger happy with the block button. It feels personal the way your team keeps blocking and slowing down my ig experience and growth. Im not using a third party app.. yes I dont want to follow a bunch of people who content and respect for my content has turned poor"
"Collaboration suggestion. Hey love the app, Im on it majority of the time. I do have a small suggestion. I have noticed that  I cant do a collaboration with  anyone until I take the privacy off from my account what I was thinking if theres a way you can set the collaboration where whoever the user try to collaborate with only the user and the people who they collaborated with their followers can only see the post so the user dont have to take the privacy off thank you I hope I made some sense"
"No support. If you ever face any issues with this app goodluck getting any support with your problem, Ivebeen constantly getting action blocked minutes after getting off another one despite never following anyone or liking photos. Theres no option for you to contact a support team to ever get help either so its either you make a new account and lose everything you have, or continue with a broken account to not lose your pictures and data"
Missing features. For some reason I dont have all the features on my business account that I have on my personal account. It makes posting a challenge
"Selling machine. Is so ridiculous that an app used to share pics and videos, now has become an store app and Whoever thought that the new post and notification icons should be on top should get fired"
Login issues. I have been logged out of my original profile which I signed in using Face book . Instagram will no longer accept my Face book login and I can not access my original profile
"If I could give 0 stars I would. This app has COMPLETELY disappointed me. For an app with so many downloads for them not to have a support team is absolutely appalling. My account was hacked somehow, mind you WITH double authentication on (which is supposed to prevent hackers). The hacker deleted my account and apparently there is nothing for instragam to do. This is the most unprofessional support I have ever seen for such a popular app. How they do not have backup for all of their accounts is beyond me. Its clear that with ceos like zuckerberg that security is obviously not a priority for them. Completely disgusting. Do better"
"Inconsistencies. Inconsistencies between accounts. Eg. able to use the add yours function on by business account, but not my personal account (using the same device)"
"Hate the suggested accounts & view older posts. Get rid of the viewing older posts and recommending new accounts, thats what the explore page is for  I want to be able to scroll through my personal feed without seeing random posts and have to find old posts from 10 minutes ago just because I viewed it already"
Hack. Someone with the name anonymous user with no profile photo is texting my friend apparently reads my DMs when nobody is in my account i turned on 2 factor authentication and someone is still trying to access my account but has seen many of my DMs
"Notifications. I love this app i really do and the only reason i gave it one star is cause these are given priority its a great app but i cant get notifications. Ive tried everything i made sure notifications were on in the app and in my phone settings, ive deleted and reinstalled, turned on and off my phone, and even reset my phone and i still dont get notifications"
My account has been stolen. This is now the 5th day.  Someone has hacked my account and I cant get back into my original account. After  8 emails back and forth to Instagram  still nothing has been helpful.  I have done everything possible to reset my account.  They could easily look into this.    But obviously dont give a f.... about the little people
"PLEASE UPDATE ASAP  , thanks.

"Error. Recently Ive tried to change my profile picture, it hasnt allowed me to change it, it keeps coming up with connection error, Ive tried turning my phone off and on, changing from WiFi to data, deleting and updating the app nothings working. Please fix this"
"Bugs. Instagram nonetheless is an amazing app, but Im afraid Im going to have to give it a 2-star rating. Instagram is an incredible app, do not get me wrong, but I have experienced many problems with this app as well. Once every month, I will get a notification telling me to change my password because my account has been compromised. It will then tell me that I have been BLOCKED from taking certain action for sharing my password with a service that helps gain more likes or follows. I have NEVER in my life done this, and never plan to. If you could KINDLY fix this problem, that would be amazing"
"Less is more. Firstly, I do like reels. I like that it has its own tab on my personal page, as well. The shop tab is also actually one of my favorite features because I can go directly to the store of outfits that are tagged. I do find one feature pesky: being able to only change your name every 14 days. I like to change my name, exit out of edit, and see how it looks. Multiple times. Call me picky or indecisive but I like to try out different things. Its annoying that you can only change it twice every two weeks. I also Strongly Dislike the fact that random posts from people I dont follow pop up on my feed. It makes me sad that I cant see the posts from people I follow that just posted. I miss chronological feed days"
"Why is my camera randomly on?. So creepy, Ill just be scrolling and the green camera light randomly turns on. Honestly is all the data mining not invasive enough? Yall gotta video record my double chin perspective browsing Instagram "
"Annoying update. I really enjoyed using Instagram for a few years but this update is seriously annoying me. Having to log in and than having it pop up stating to confirm that its me for every single hour that I am logged in, its starting to piss me off. Yes, the security issue I get but just having to do it for hours and hours I hate it. I would give it five stars but I rather have this update option removed so that I have my two accounts in piece. I cant even log in to my personal account because of this and i believe other people who have fan accounts or an account in general have this issue"
"Worst glitch. Insta has been having so many problems lately Its honestly very upsetting. I recently noticed a glitch in my insta follows. When I look on my moms phone I have 1,871 followers, which is correct. But when I log into insta on my personal account it says 2,036. Please fix this issue. There is always a problem occurring"
"I like it, but I cant put posts on my story. I love this app  It helps get my drawings through and lets more people be able to see them  The only thing that really bothers me is the fact that I can put any posts on my story, even my own ones  Thats only with my art account (@_melonmoon) but it doesnt happen on my other personal account.  I want to find a way to where I can put posts on my story, but everything says its just a bug.  I wish Instagram would fix it :("
"Comments blocked. So, I have been blocked from commenting because I have commented on giveaways...however after sending a PM to Instagram, they refuse to give any information as to what type of algorithm it uses. Used to be able to comment as much as I want, however now i get blocked once a day...pretty ridiculous"
Horrible. I run a business and after two months of trying to get them to figure out what is wrong on their end so I can get my promotions back and running I havent heard anything from them then I try to switch my account to personal so that I can reset it and switch it back to my business account so that maybe the promotions will work and now theyre saying they cant fix that is something wrong on their hands like its always something wrong with Instagram my account always has a issue its to the point where Im very close to deleting this account. They never respond to any of the 500+ emails I have sent to them about the same problem
Account Hacked. Account was hacked and I lost all my information Locked me out of my own account 
"Horrible Customer Service. My account was blocked for liking too much, which I thought thats what the app was for... but I get it, you dont want spam. Ive written them over 50 times to tell you guys Im not a spam account and that Im actually a real person, but Im still blocked and its been over a week going on 2...  Its a business account so now Im only able to post stuff with no caption so my customers lack that personal connection. The growth of my company is now suffering. Thanks"
"LET ME DEACTIVATE?. Reactivated after I realised I needed a phone number in my messages and now it wont let me deactivate again this week. What a joke. The fact that I have - at best - limited control over my own account, personal security and visibility is an absolute disgrace"
Get rid of ads. You should get rid of the spam accounts I dont want a girl twerking on my screen I just want to look at some funny memes
"Still learning. Still learning to use it. Dont know how to change the orientation of my screen, it seems to only want to go vertical. Also learning about privacy, etc. Id like that I can link quickly to Pages that I would otherwise have to search for"
"Disappearing photos. Besides the fact that the new update is absolute crap ive come across a small issue that might be a personal one but i hope not. Is anybody else having issues with seeing photo details, the quick photos you send directly to people use to have a fetal bottom where it shows you do they screenshot,replayed, or opened your photos but i cant seem to get that information anymore. whats going on?????"
Keep watching. Hi Instagram can you somehow get rid of keep watching because its getting annoying thank you guys
"Multiple Account Access. I have a personal account and a photography account. I am unable to access my photography account as the email address is no longer valid. I tried utilizing the phone number retrieve but since both accounts are associated with the same phone its only allowing me access to my personal. It has been months trying to resolve the issue and I have not received a response through the service support email. I wish there was a call support number which could help triage these type of issues. As a entrepreneur, I do not want to create another account if I already have one existing, thats misleading and poor customer experience. Please help me resolve would be greatly appreciated"
"So annoying. I&#39;ve had the same account for YEARS and have SO MANY memories and photos on there that I want to remember. I have followers on there that I liked. Then I was logged out and no way to be logged back in. It wasn&#39;t hacked because everything&#39;s the same, but it won&#39;t let me log back into MY ACCOUNT. WHAT IS GOING ON. I&#39;m absolutely devastated and there&#39;s nobody to help. The costumer service phone number doesn&#39;t work and I don&#39;t know what to do. Please Instagram DO BETTER"
Love it but I have a problem PLZZ FIX. LOVE Instagram its an og for life but sometimes when I send messages they dont send like theres a circle on the right side of the message and I have to switch to data for it to send or I have to exit the app and go back in plzzzz fix
Instagram. INSTAGRAM please change your block setting so that if one person blocks someone the other person being blocked can do the same to the other person instead of just hiding the account Even if you dont want to do that giving the option to add their account name manually to a list or something to block works as well. This is a privacy issue as well
"Funny how they make it so hard to delete your account. A truly scummy unethical brand. All you have to do is see how hard it is to delete your account: cant do it from the app. Forgot your password? Theyll send you a link that only directs you to the app login. Doesnt send you to reset your password, just lets you login to do what you want (except delete your account, for which you actually need to change the password for). At best, product design is abysmal and overlooked for advertising, at worst its a way to continue to collect data by preventing you from deleting it"
"Help. Hi, good afternoon I have a little problem with Instagram lately, I cant like post because the action is blocked . I already reported the problem on Instagram but I think it did not work at all. Please fix this problem because its my personal account and like other people I like my family and friends posts. Good afternoon and God bless you"
Not what it used to be. The timeline isnt chronological and they replaced the notification tab with a marketplace that no one asked for
Terrible app. This app has insane censorship rules and backwards community guidelines. The app commits multiple privacy invasions. Its super glitchy. The ads are everywhere and are inappropriate clickbait. Do not use this crap
4 Star review. Im giving this a 4 star review cause they need to get rid of the Covid info tab that pops up on posts that talk or show stuff related to Covid
Music. I switched to a personal account and I still keep getting all that royalty free music smh what is up with that
Search section. Instagram my search section wont work i have a bucket load of data but everytime i use the search option its not loading nothing
"I cannot access my account at all. I know all my information, like my username AND password. And yet I STILL cant get into my account?? Ive told them to send me a link through my email 5 times, no link. Ive told them to send me a code through my phone number, and what they send me is just a link BACK to the screen Im already at? Fix this"
"Love it but new updates are irritating. I have always loved this app Its a great way to stay conned to friends and to display personal creativity. However, one of the newer updates turning the feed page to an explore page after you finish scrolling through all new, unseen posts is HIGHLY annoying. The old format was way better and I wish I could switch it back. Also, the fact of how political the app has become is also very irritating. I do not need updates on the election through this app...thats what news apps are for"
"No way to access account. There is nobody to contact if you cant access your account. They just give you lists but no actual contact information. Ive re-downloaded the app three times to see if it would let me login, but every time it just goes back to the same page doesnt tell me if I did it or not. A constant loop with no help"
INSTAGRAM MUSIC BROKEN. I have a business account and Ive been trying to add music to my Instagram storys and its not allowing me to. I tried switching to personal and It stilk gives me weird music selections?? This is driving me crazy
"Share to story option missing. Ive tried contacting support MULTIPLE times and have yet to hear back. I have no option to share a post on my story, when I click the airplane all I can do is send the post to one of my friends... if I click on someones post with privacy settings it will tell me that persons privacy settings dont allow sharing to my story..... can we please fix this issue?? Ive tried all options of resetting, uninstalling/ reinstalling, logging out... logging back in.... SO FRUSTRATING"
Help. My app has not been loading the past 5 hours ive tried wifi data being outside being inside rebooting the app rebooting my wifi turning my phone off and i dont know what to do
"Photos not loading, videos freezing. For the past 3-4 weeks, about 33% of content wont load. Doesnt matter if Im on wifi or data. All my other devices and apps are functioning fine. Ive rebooted my router and my phone. Still not working. What is going on?? My app is up to date. Im going to uninstall and reinstall. Also, I wish IG would ditch the reels and stories. If I wanted those, Id be on tiktok. And show me content from EVERYONE Im following"
"I cant open my personal account. Once i open instagram and switch to user to one specific account of mine, the app crashes and it gets closed.I have tried, reinstalling the instegram application, restarting my phone, updating my phone, but issue has not been resolved"
"Intentionally difficult to navigate. How many times does this happen to you?You load the app, it immediately shows you an interesting image. And then it finishes loading more data and immediately buried that image 20 minutes into the feed causing whatever you were just looking at to be lost.How many times does this happen to you?You stop on an image, maybe you just loaded the app, and theres a NEW IMAGES button hovering in the middle of the screen. You scroll ip a little, down a little, it stays there stalking you until you push it. When you DO push it, usually by accident, you just lost wherever you just were for another twenty minutes.100% of the time it happens every time. This behavior is by design, yet we have to put up with it"
App Not Working Right. On the app Im getting a pop up saying Im being restricted and it wont let me follow anyone or heart any posts. Yet when I log into my account via the web I can do all that with no problem or issues and I dont get any pop ups at all. I had to create a new account because my original was hacked. I got access back only for it to be hacked less than a minute later. Apparently many accounts are being hacked. Please fix the app and also please look into the hacker situation as well
"Inconsistencies across  accounts. I have three accounts- one for a business I run with a friend, a personal one, and a teacher one (so my students can find me but its just school stuff).The issue is each one looks different and the ones I actually want to use reels with (teacher and business account) dont have reels. What gives? Ive reported this glitch everyday for the last week after being bored just waiting for the update and no one has gotten back to me- not even an automated message. For the love of all that is social media, PLEASE fix this glitch And please help me I want to use your platform but at this point Im debating just abandoning Instagram for my business account and just switching to tik tok because I cant compete with reels with just posts and stories anymore"
Reposting story. I am beyond irritated that I cannot repost a post to my story on my personal account but I can on my business account. My personal account is public and allows resharing Please fix this issue
"New Feed Update is Horrible. The new update filling your personal feed with suggested posts is just awful it makes me so mad. Instead of seeing the posts of people I chose to follow its cluttered with random suggested posts, thats literally what the explore page is for. Change it back now"
Major glitch. I cannot get my feed or any content to refresh/load. I manage 2 other ig accounts and they both work fine from my iPhone or laptop. Every time I try to log into my personal account it gives me an error message couldnt refresh feed or something went wrong blah blah blah. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling etc but it is only a problem with my one personal account

"Very good but had some issues. Ive had very good experiences using this app; catching up with friends, entertainment, making friends. But I have had a few minor and annoying issues while having this app. This consists of a few minor bits of lag that lasted for a very short while then went back to normal. And the other issue is that i cannot reload my feed and load my messages (my WiFi is doing fine and even if it was my WiFi I turned it off and used data and still didnt work). Even though there had been a few issues the app is great and recommend it"
"Poor security and Lacks of maintenance. Kept having hack bots and creeps message me, my account my be private now but when it was private hack accounts keep trying to send me messages (they shouldnt be able to) and when I report the problem, NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT IT"
"Great app. All I want to change on this app is that you can have unlimited amount of accounts going at one time, reason for this is because I use Instagram as a personal blogger for singers who I like can the developers please do this you will make more people than you know happier"
"Broken notifications. Since upgrading to a new phone I cant get notifications to work at all. Having checked all the settings ten times, lots of reinstalling and rebooting, still nothingTurns out Im not the only one and theres a big thread on the web which seems to come down to whether you restored a new phone from backup, and if you did the only way to get them working is to wipe everything and install as a new phone which looses all your data. Apple say its Instagrams fault, Instagram say nothing because there is no help desk, no human to ask. So if you have notifications working; count yourself lucky"

Not working. Hi Instagram. I just want to let you know why I cant get access to my 2 accounts I have on Instagram. I can log into them on my old iPhone 5s but not on my iPhone 7+. Ive tried everything such as logging in with my number Email and saying forget password. Nothing seems to work. Ive also shut down my phone and deleted the app. But nothing seems to work at this point. Please get back to me
"Whats not to love?. I love the new features on the app like reels and some of the added goodies for stories. Also, being able to track the sites Ive visited straight off the app is super usual as well if I ever forget something I searched and wanted to go back to it"
What The F Did You Do????. WTH did you do to this app???? You have made the WORST decision of all time. Now my homefeed is nothing but Suggested Posts and ads. I thought it was just a few posts but scrolling down and further down its all now suggested posts and ads Why the F would you do this???? These suggested posts are no different than ads Whats the point of the explore feed now when you are shoving the same S H I T down our throats on our personal homefeed???? YOU ARE THE WORST COMPANY ON THE PLANET NOTHING BUT F-ing CANCERI will be unistalling this app Goodbye
Spam bot galore. They can&#39;t even go stop the spam bot DMs. It&#39;s such a massive problem. All these stupid brands with bots telling you to go look at their accounts  not only that imagine getting hacked because you clicked on one of these links
Welcome to 1984. Tracking and selling your information. Totalitarian censorship.  Label any facts you dislike as misinformation.  Pathetic tools of the Marxist left. Deleting my account
"They do nothing for hacked accounts. My spouses account got hacked. They reported it, I reported it, and several of our friends reported it and nothing has been done about it. The scammer is still using the account and still reaching out to friends and family. Its been two months and were still get contacted by friends/family about my spouses account trying to get their cashapp info. Very frustrating"
"Updates -_-. I have a personal account and a business accounts. How is it that my business account for about a month now has had the new messenger update, but my personal account doesnt? Help"
"Why do you continue to make things worse?. Why move the likes button? Why erase the post button? Why am I seeing more posts from random people than those I follow? Replacing the likes section with a shopping section is one of the worst ideas Ive ever seen. Everything just seems so ugly now, so business-oriented, and nothing feels personal anymore. Been using for several years, but now Im highly considering deleting until things return to how they were. Please keep your average users in mind, not only businesses/shops/creators. This new update is just so bad"
"My Review So Far. Ive been using this app since 2012/2013 and I absolutely love seeing different pictures, videos, and all kinds of media. Ive been getting so many ideas and trends that are coming up from so many people worldwide. The app is versatile, creative, colorful, and innovative. The problem Im currently is that I keep having the Ingress Timeout error when I open the Saved option. I would organize pictures that I saved in collections and that the collections would not show up. In very views days, they did show up; but not for long. Im currently removing saved posts that I dont need to make room for data. I have been updating, restarting, reinstalling, and type of method you can think of and they all still dont work When I go to my liked posts, they show up fine. Its just that Im unable to see my saved collections. Please Help Me So thats my 4 star rating cause for now. Otherwise, its still a great app"
"Suggested/ personalized content on home tab. After a recent update, after viewing new posts I am now forced to view suggested content that I would find in the discover tab. I prefer to view older posts of the my personal connections/ people I follow over random content that I could find elsewhere on my home tab without having to click another button. If I wanted to view this suggested I would go to my discover tab"

"Suggested Post. Do not update. The latest update add a very annoying feature which invades the home page. This feature is called Suggested Post which are post made by accounts that you dont follow. Complete nonsense Instagram (Facebook), the follow button is made make sure that you want to see that accounts content in the future. This ruins the personal experience"
terrible. Allowed my account to get hacked from a different phone and fully deleted with no warning. thanks a lot Dont you have people to authorize stuff like that?
Locked Out Of Account For No Reason. okay so I have had Instagram for about six years and I LOVE the app. up until February when it said someone logged onto my account and so I changed my password. well after changing my password it logged me out and now I am unable to log back in. my account was not hacked though. I tried everything I could think of and everything on the internet. I can not log in on my phone and on any of my devices but I can log in on someone elses phone. I have done absolutely nothing wrong to violate any guidelines and I have emailed Instagram many times asking for help. its been two months and still no help and my Instagram doesnt work. I am not very impressed by Instagram at the moment
"Cannot share posts to my story?. I have used Instagram for years and I love the app, however I downloaded it on my new device (iPhone XS Max) and i am I unable to share posts from any public Instagram account to my story. I know these Instagram accounts are public so it is not a matter of their privacy setting. I go to the post I want to share, press the share icon and there is no option to share to my story. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have looked in my settings for something that may be causing but on my end, but I really dont know whats causing this problem. I had no issue sharing posts to my story on previous devices. Can anyone Tell me how to fix this? Is this a bug on the latest version of Instagram? I would love to hear feedback for this problem as i value Instagram very much, but the absence of this feature for me is disappointing in my experience. Awaiting feedback, Thanks"
"Likes Not Appearing in Notifications. I dont know what happened but I have 2 accounts, one for business and that one is fine, shows all my likes, comments and followers notifications, however on my personal account it wont show who liked my pics, sent me a message or followed me. None of those notifications show up and Ive deleted the app, restarted my phone, logged in and out and checked all my push notifications and I dont know what but something is acting up"
Terrible. Horrible app. My account was just disabled for unusual activity that was really just me unfollowing people. You have no way to contact them at all. Terrible customer service and worse privacy. Do not recommend
"Love Instagram but. Long time user of Instagram and never had any issues. Recently got a new phone, downloaded the app and now do not receive any notifications from Instagram. I have tried all methods to fixing the issue. Delete app, reinstall, restart device with and without the app downloaded, checked all notification settings on phone and instagram(all are on), updated to the most recent iOS &amp; app update, yet still no notifications. Someone help"
"Bad. Many bugs, flashing try again disclaimerMessages are delayed up to 5 minutesImages take up to 30 seconds to remove revealing whatever privacy you had At first it was good but after a while its not worth using unless you just text or see your friends posts but other than that discord is 5 levels ahead"
"Not letting me login into other accounts. I have a personal account &amp; a business account, before I was able to login between them both, now it keeps saying sorry there was a problem with your request each time I try to login. Also, the followers from my personal account, keep showing up on my business account? This is very unprofessional, Ive reported this problem twice to instagram. Fix this"
"Creating accounts. Im fed up with my account getting deactivated every time i try to make two accounts. Ones my personal one which is still working and the other one is where I sell my art pieces from and that keeps getting deactivated, how am I suppose to earn money and get commissions when my page keep getting taken down by instagram"

Ive reported a problem and it hasnt helped. Regardless of the privacy of my account or anyone elses, the add post to story is gone"
My account wouldnt refresh feed or stories.

"Bug?. I upload to my stories but post maybe once or twice a year to my feed. That being said, every time I have wanted to post, it takes days to upload. I get the Not Posted Yet. Please try again. I thought it was just last year but I got this message today and retried but nothing. I refreshed, same message. I turned on my data and retried on my wifi but same thing. Then I deleted and reinstalled the app and now I dont see the message or my post. Thats my only problem. Other than that, everything else is working fine"
Had to leave. Had to leave for security reasons.  They do not respect users privacy

It is very frustrating because i want to use the new features but I cant. I manage other 2 accounts that do have the latest update and versions but my main account doesnt. I dont know what to do, I even emailed Instagram about the pro unit nothing has happened. Help"
"Meh. Tengi una cuenta de instagram en la cual vendo joyeria desde el 2018. Cuento con mi pagina web artedeferrer.com y e tratado mil veces de hacer mi cuenta de instagram shopping y no puedo porque instagram dice que yo no vendo nada, pero a mj cuenta personal si le autoriza a vender. Me pueden explicar cual es el problema. Tampoco me puedo comunicar con alguien que pueda resolver mi situación. Es horrible, me encanta instagram pero creo que es una plataforma nada friendly"

"Way too many ads that continue to freeze my phone. Im getting an ad every 3 posts in my feed and after most stories. This is way too much. Not to mention that the bug fixes still dont address that dismissing ads will often freeze my phone to the point where I cant do anything or even lock the phone. This app is opportunistic, oppresses Black and Indigenous voices and creators, censors fat bodies, thinks nipples are offensive, and generally makes ridiculous amounts of money and mines personal data for profit. Total crap"
Cant record more than 15seconds on personal account. Ok so I love IG. I have 3 different accounts but for some reason I cant record more than 15 seconds on IG stories for my original account. The other two have the progress ring  go around and around. But for my original account it stops at one revolution. I cant seem to source anything online for a solution but I have found that I am not the only one with this problem. Any info that can be shared. I have been trying to up my social media game since quarantine and this is an annoyance. I have to record my videos separately and then post to IG. Its just not really that efficient
Insta-Friends. Ive met so many wonderful friends and have been inspired by so many creative people on this  incredible app- Paul

"Account is hacked, no support. My business account was hacked last Wednesday, the hacker changed my email and phone number and I have not been given any options to submit a report request or submit a selfie verification video. Ive submitted reports against my hacked account every day just to get in touch with support somehow and have heard nothing back. I feel like there is no way to get help or my account back"
"Great app. I love this app, the only thing that I am disappointed about is that I have a personal account and a public account. And I dont have reels on my public account"
"Havent been able to get into my hacked account for over a year Emails dont help. I email Instagram and a bot generated code is emailed to me asking me to take a picture holding the numbers. I do so. Then they email me a password change code, I change the password. I go to the app to sign in and it says a code has been sent to an email or phone number THAT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE. My daughters photos are in my archive. My memories I have had that account for years This is one of the MANY MANY ATTEPMTS Ive made to try and recover my account. Please, help"
Fast way to keep in touch. I like the ability to separate my personal account from my English students account
"Miss the old days. From a personal perspective, its annoying seeing all these irrelevant sponsored pagesFrom a business perspective I guess I understand.Would be nice to have a feature to turn it off though"
Following list will not load. Enjoyed the app very much but this past weekend my following list would not load. Kept receiving error message Couldnt load users.  Just updated the app and still happens.  Doesnt matter if Im on WiFi or data
Glitching. My own personal page when i click to view it does not turn on. Screen goes black and cant do anything after that. I have to reset the app to go back to instagram photos that others post. Only when i try to view my own page it happens. Has been going on for a week or so very very annoying
"Not Worthy. Aside from lying and spying to all users, they are spreading lies and preventing truth, really not worth using it"
"Refuses to Fix Major Bug. I enjoying using Instagram, but Ive had this bug issue for over a year now and Ive contacted them several times and they still havent fixed it. Being a iPhone user, Im sure Im not the only one with it. I cannot add any posts to my story (Not uploading a new post directly to the sorry, but someone elses posts to my story). I have several accounts for business/personal use, but my alternate accounts do it just fine, just not my main one. This is quite annoying because I always feel like Im missing out on a major feature that everyone else gets to enjoy"

Instagram professional account error. So I was having trouble with my promotions on my account so I switched back to a personal account and then tried to switch to a business account again but I am hit with an error saying you have reached the limit for the number of businesses you can create at this time and I have no idea how to fix this. I have been having this error for months now and I have gotten 0 feedback or assistance with this issue and it is extremely aggravating. I dont want to make an entire new account in order to have a professional account. If there is any way to fix this I will rewrite my review and give 5 stars but this issue has been going on for too long. Instagram please get back to me ASAP
HATTTTEEE. Hate it. Hate using it now. Ive been using it as a personal blog and its not fun anymore. They make it hard for ppl to view you hard to find you. Theyre making it into the worst app
WHY AM I NOT GETTING NOTIFICATIONS AT ALL :/. Ok so Ive done literally EVERYTHING to get my notifications to work but it wont turn on. I recently got a new phone and downloaded the app on my new phone and signed out of the accounts on my old phone however I realized I wasnt getting notifications on my new phone at all and I have to constantly keep checking the app and its just getting annoying. Ive tried doing it from the settings in my phone and it says theyre on so I also went to Instagram settings and it also says that its on there too yet I still get no notifications. I also tried deleting the app and re downloading it but that didnt work. Im getting notifications from every other app except Instagram. Whats going on
"Why cant users disable auto play??? . Also, NO MORE TRACKING OR DATA SHARING"
Visual hit. Good visual interaction. Elon says images can communicate much more data than words
"Easy to hack, no user support. My account was hacked recently. The hacker changed my password, email, and phone number without my permission. IG didnt confirm the changes via email, they just sent an email saying the changes were done. When i tried to undo the changes, i was told the opportunity timed out and i could not be helped. When i tried to recover the account using facial recognition, IG told me my own face couldnt be confirmed with pictures of me. IG basically doesnt care to have anyone resolve this issue and forces the users to talk to a computer cant help. Absolutely awful. If someone from IG that can help me sees this, please contact me, and maybe we can resolve this"
No more personal opinions. You dont have the right to think for your self
"Bad. It gets slower every day that I use it, it won&#39;t even load on wifi anymore, I have to use data and even then its slower than ever. It&#39;s constantly bugged or broken in a dozen or so ways. The rules are enforced so disproportionately and unevenly that it&#39;s hard to tell if there are any rules"
"Awesome App. Awesome app, Ive been using it for quite sometime for my personal posts but I recently started a business and I dont think my business wouldve been as successful as it is now if it wasnt for Instagram "
"Not impersonating anyone. My account is, or rather was until a few days ago, jake_wants_to_help.For some reason, my account got disabled for impersonating someone else, when in reality I wasnt. And when I went to complain about this, it has me put my phone number in and my name and that picture, but it doesnt work. It keeps saying you are currently trying to fix it but I just want my account back. Its my personal, and its not even a fan account. This isnt fair, so Id ask if you could please give me my account again. That would be great. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way"
Cant login in. It wont let me log back into my account and all of my information is correct plz fix this
Part of the Zuckerberg spy conglomerate. Need I say more?
"UPDATE. the new update of suggested posts in your personal feed is so dumb, and j pointless you have an explore page for a reason?"
"Needs improvement. The first thing that lets it down is that it doesnt support landscape mode, in portrait mode its not easy to type on the piddly little keyboard. Notifications dont seem to work even though I have settings set as receive all notifications. I dont get emails to notify me of private messages, so messages can sit their for weeks before they get noticed. Landscape photos are cropped down to portrait view trimming off a lot of what your wanting to see. Its not top of my preferred media sharing apps I use for these reasons. Needs a complete rethink to get a few more stars"
"Instagram Update. I have updated my Instagram, and Im still unable to get the new fonts for my stories. There are also options where you can play videos in stories, and it doesnt do it for me. My business account and my other personal accounts have those options, but the Instagram I had since 2011 isnt updated to the newer version. Please fix. Thank you"
Hackers. Fred_erick222 and smcveen159 are people who hacked my mom and sister just recently. About a year ago my personal private account was hacked and I lost everything. Instagram can you delete those 2 accounts?
"Useless features. This update added so many useless features such as shopping and reels which copied from tik tok, seeing other posts and liked post were hide somewhere else.Too much advertising and tracking private"
Instagram needs to reply help messages. I love Instagram but I am getting real stressed out because I have a few accounts and they do not have the same features My personal account does not have reels or other features that the other accounts do have and it is quiet a bummer and I have sent several help messages and no reply
"The app never loads. The app never loads, Ive connected to different wifi at all my friends houses and it wont load, Ive tried to just use my data. Still wont load, Ive looked for updates, my app is up to date, my phone is up to date, but the app still will not load"
Account blacks out. When I try to go to my personal account the screen blacks out. It&#39;s a black screen with no tabs to go to the explore page
"Live Videos. I have absolutely zero interest in watching anyones live videos. I have turned all live video notifications off in settings and found that it didnt make any difference. Ive gone to the pages and manually switch the notification settings there from a default some to none. So in two locations in the app i have selected ZERO NOTIFICATIONS FOR LIVE VIDEOS. Yet here I am STILL receiving notifications in the app. WHY ARE YOU PUSHING LIVE SO HARD? ITS GARBAGE AND SHOULDNT EXIST. Also, why does it post to my created page on Facebook and not my actual personal profile?"
Reels not working when you have more than one account. I have a personal and blog account and my personal has reels but Instagram has not added it to my blog account
"can you fix this glitch. My account keeps saying that my account has music access changes, everytime i go to add music to my story. it says  we recently became aware that your business account inadvertently had access to our licensed music library. unfortunate we have to remote that access. you can still use facebooks feature sound collection, which features 9,000 royalty free songs and sounds from variety of genres. the songs they are allowing me to use are not even american. their are different languages that i cant understand. when i go to search up nicki manji or other artist they dont pop up. ive tried fixing it by logging in and out several times i even deleted and reinstalled the app and it still isnt working ive switched back to my personal account and it still isnt working. ive done nothing wrong i submitted a complaint through the actual app and yall have yet to help me solve the problem"
"No help whatsoever. I was locked out of my main account about 4 days ago because of suspicious activity when it was just a app that i had to track my followers. Now every time i try to have instagram send a verification code to my email, it never sends. Ive had my account for years and theres no one or nothing that will help me get my account back. I cant even email an actual person which is ridiculous. As many people that use instagram, they should have a better system to fix problems like this"
"App asks for your birthday more personal information. Cant use app unless I place my birthdate. I could make one up. However, erasing app now. It was a fun app"
Ability to delete conversations for both sides. There must be a possibility to actually delete the whole conversations (the messages you sent and received) for both sides for some privacy issues
Bruh. I cant even make an account . it says bad connection but I have full bars and using data and WiFi
"Ridiculous. Sorry, there was a problem with your request. Thats the message I keep receiving every time I try to log in through Facebook or just entering my account login info. This has been going on since 10/04/21 and has continued to be a problem even though I have access to my Facebook account and have entered all of my login information correctly"
Instagram Music Sticker Missing. For some reason I dont have the option to add music to a story post anymore. Its a personal account also and not a business account so thats not the reason
My review. Its good except the false info censoring of stuff that isnt actually false
Suggested posts on homepage is horrid. I do not want suggested posts on my home page. That is not why I have a private Instagram account where I only follow 20 people. I want to avoid spam. The suggested posts features is an abhorrent spam on a clean feed. It is also a gross way of trying to increase user hours on the site
Instagram doesnt work when I put Audio on my pics. This has been a issue for a while When Im on cellar data I cannot add music to my pics infact it doesnt even load It freezes like that l So I have to wait till I get home to add music to my photos
ADs now play when Use less data is enabled. Auto playing advertisements without the ability to control it is a horrible customer experience. It uses cellular data and reroutes audio even though mute is still on. Not everyone has unlimited data and some people have MFi hearing aids that dont enjoy audio being taken over by the app
"Posting a story with a gif or moving picture. I have a business &amp; a personal account. On the business account when posting a story I have different options to when posting on my personal in terms of font options...but on neither can I now upload a story that has a gif or moving image with it?? I can post a story if it only contains static picture emoji or text with no problem. Its not a network or internet issue as I can do it from my iPad with no problems. I cannot see anywhere why it wont upload &amp; I dont see why all of sudden I cannot do this? Ive deleted &amp; re downloaded  the app &amp; deactivated my accounts etc but still no joy. In the grand scheme of things its not that important, but it is frustrating, so thought Id write a review incase anyone else is having the same issue?"
"Still dont have reels. I have updated my app so many times hoping to get reels on my account. I have reels on my personal page, but not my business page. Not being able to create reels is really hindering my growth. I seem to be the only person without them. I have tried reaching out to Instagram so many times to no avail. Would love some help on this issue"
Over it. I haven't been able to add saved music to my reels for weeks. The saved tab doesnt even come up anymore and now I cant get my DM to load at all on my personal account. Im more than frustrated and havent gotten any help or response as to why. My app is updated to the latest version. Im really over Instagram at this point
Need a note or tag storing spot. Its hard to organize and keep track of tags u use for your pages without going to a different app for notes to save for quick access
"I hate your new update. The new update with the cute font and the EXTRA layout it really dumb Like the font is alright but the fact that youre trying to make it look uwu as if the REELS, SHOP, ADS, and harder to post your pictures werent enoughBring back the older Instagram Suggested posts is useless when we can find it on the SEARCH barI really dislike the REELS especially when it is centered out in the middle as if it is the most important part of a photo sharing app. If we want reels, just go on TIKTOKNobody uses the shops especially when people just want to post pictures to what we like. Please make it simpler like before No one really likes the Reels to be honest. We just want to post pictures and scroll through pictures without data absorbing our phone just because you want to make it look cute. To be fair, Insta is better then TIKTOK. So, if the company sees this, I rather choose normal insta then TIKTOK any freaking day "
A bit of a rant haha. Is there a way IG could allow you to change the order of photos on personal page to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Please It would make things a lot better Also when you post multiple photos the size of the IG screen for the next photos shrink and crops the borders. Makes me not want to post collages. Also a fun idea if stories would stay up and pile up till the follower watches it. Then 24 hours later that story would disappear. Haha like maybe up to a weeks worth or as many as there is lol I just hate that the stories go away in just one day and my crush missed it  ps still love INSTAGRAM 
"Feed. You need to fix my feed this time, im tired of all the spam Bot meme pages that all sell the exact same thing"
Bugs. i updated my application &amp; deleted and redownladed and i am still experiencing the same bugs. i am unable to change my profile picture  or bio info
"So frustrating. I mean who cares at this point, we are all stuck using this app.  Likes to save all the photos I post to my camera roll despite the toggle unchecked that saves photos I post.  So I end up with double photos in my camera roll all the time.  Bans me for posting too many photos at once but cant keep scammers and promoters out of my DMs and comments.  Its so frustrating and frankly not healthy to use this app, but they dont care, its just to collect your data anyway.  No customer service or way of resolving my problems, thanks for your time"
"Please help with music issue. Ive been having issues for the last few days I changed my account fromBusiness to personal account and it still wont show my music , like the music option is there but they took all the good songs away . Can someone please help me fix this issue .Thanks . I absolutely love Instagram but Im struggling to fix this issue . Theres no tutorial or Information on how to fix this"
"Not the same platform. This used to be a great way to see what my friends were doing without using Facebook. Much more personal. Then I thought it would be fun to see some of the random stuff. Now I dont have that intimate setting, its just a feed of random skateboarders, guitarists, and impossibly hot babes. Is this a beer commercial?"
"terrible customer service. i lost my account due to someone hacking it and i tried to get my account back and emailed instagram 9 times and never got a single response back, the hacker posted all my private information and hacked many people i know, i lost everything and just had to make a new account. the help center didnt even help one bit, overall they have terrible customer service"
"In app notification. There's no way to deactivate in app notification, so I keep getting spam by live video that I really don't care about & I don't wanna unfollow some of them because they're clients. Plz do something, the mute notifications only work for out side the app"
Locked out of Account. Very disappointed in randomly being locked out of my personal account. I did all the steps to get my account back and the app crashed on me. I even did a photo ID email and still have heard nothing back. Its disappointing
Awesome sauce. Good for visuals and information can update you if your world and personal life with things as simple as comments likes and interest. Changing and shaping the social hierarchy hierarchy
Music stories. Music in stories for my business IG isnt working but its working on my personal IG help centre doesnt respond - please fix ASAP
"New algorithm not good. I miss so much of my friends and familys posts because of the new algorithm. When I open the app I dont always have time to scroll through all the posts, and when I reopen the app, the posts I didnt see get broken off and covered up by suggested posts. Suggested posts belong on the explore page, not my personal feed"
Add Yours for Professional/Creator Accounts. Why isnt the new feature available for people with profession/creator/business accounts?? It seems to only be available on my personal account and not my professional one. Why not just make it a feature available to every account type? Makes no sense
"Just this. Ive currently made another account and today when I decide to put music on one of the stories I noticed that I couldnt, I went to my personal account and saw that I could. Thats the only thing that trouble me. I love the app a lot, its just that tiny problem"
"Unable to access and change my email after hacking. I have bad this app for more than 10 years and all my accounts keep getting blocked and hacked and as i initially missed one letter of my email address, i cannot access the given email and i cannot recover my accounts. There is no option to contact instagram and change my email and i am so annoyed that i need to create new accounts and start all over again and to even be unable to delete the accounts that are blocked as i have a lot of photos locked in them"
"Cookies and spy. I didnt find any options for cookies preference in the app, preference cookies chose should be concerned"
"Unable to Like Posts or Follow People. Similarly to another review I saw, Ive used this app for years and have a small personal account with around 500 followers (friends, family, classmates). Around 3 weeks ago I began having problems with liking posts and following other users; when I try to do this it tells me the action is restricted. Ive reported the issue several times and even tried to call and email for help but the issue remains unsolved"
Software issues. Stories are not loading or taking forever to load. Its not my cellular data nor my wife. New software issue
"Wont let me repost stories. I love using instagram but the little bugs that occur kinda bothers me. Not only is it a bug but its a hug for only a select few people I used to be able to repost other ppls stories, recently ive found an issue where I can not repost my art account stories to my main account and I thought maybe it was bc I am switch accounts too fast but then earlier today I realized its all my followers ppl who arent private and I previously could share their stories onto mine I can no longer do anymore Please help me fix this I have tried turning on and off the allow story share in my privacy settings, restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling instagram app but nothing is working I have also noticed a bug where it says follow back to my art account and then switches back to following while I am using my main account :d"
New updates are HORRIBLE. This app just keeps getting worse and worse. My brand page has certain features but no music features. My personal page has completely different features than my brand page. Ive sent emails and messages regarding my issues with no response. They keep stealing ideas from other apps instead of listening to their users and being original. I hope someone comes up with a better app
"Option for chronological order?. Remember when hashtags actually worked in chronological order and you had a real chance at exposure? Remember when you saw posts from all the people you follow? Now its a mystery game that keeps popular pages in the spotlight. Its sad to see a once amazing app take a turn for the worst. Please change it for better, people need a decent platform more than ever, and if it's not changed something better will either come along or people will abandon ship. Haven't you made enough money off our data and ads? I used to post more and scroll through several times a day in chronological order. Now I hardly check it through and hardly post because it gets 2 views. I know it's not coming back"
"great app until music effect stopped working . this app is pretty good for me to be able to express myself, so thats why i enjoy posting on my story. however, recently, i guess some copyright issues came from the instagram music effect (the effect that lets you add music to your clips/pictures) and now it doesnt work for me. the only thing that pops up is weird music that ive never heard in my entire life and when i try looking up popular artists nothing shows like as if they dont exist. ive only seen a few people talk about this and thought, well maybe its because im a business account instead of personal account. so i switched to a personal account and it still didnt work and tried the creator account and that didnt work either. please fix this issue asap, i enjoy using the music add on to be able to show my emotions/convey and express myself"
"Support request not working. I got my account @rostudio.nyc hacked months ago, and I can only request support from the app (not from web) and the first issue is that asks for email confirmation code but switching from apps deletes all progress, so you have to use one device to request support and another one to get all the info they need. Second issue is that when I say Im hacked asks for double authentication code I never set up, if I select the option other way to authenticate asks for my email address and gets an error that that email doesnt work, no matter which one I enter, a small bug that made me loose all my followers, conversations, clients, etc.Someone was able to hack my account in seconds but I need more than 2 months to get it back? Instagram this is just ridiculous"
Messages dont send if you leave the app. Hey IG can you explain why if I send someone a video in a DM and then immediately leave the app the video will literally not send until I open the app again? can you fire your overpaid talentless engineers for failing to understand the concept of asynchronous data transfer? Same issue with stories. Gotta leave the app open for it to upload. You guys are just horrible at tour job and its absolutely pathetic. Kys
"Keeps crashing. I have two accounts: one personal and one for my business. Whenever I access my business account, Instagram keeps crashing to the point where I can barely switch back to my personal account Please sort this out, had this issue for a few days now and is very frustrating"
One problem. I cannot share any stories/posts to my personal story. Ive inquired multiple times and no response as to what to do. Please help
"No reels on my account. I have a personal and a business account. I have reels on my personal, but not my business. I have tried deleting and re downloading the app, and Ive had multiple influencers and clients look at it and nobody can figure out why. Please help"
FIX YOUR APP. I went off the app for an hour and I got hacked. My account is private and Ive never shared my password with ANYONE Everyone that follows me got some weird messages and pictures that wasnt even from me. If my private information gets out I promise I will sue
"Fix Bugs. Please fix the following bugs1. I am unable to reshare other pples stories. I did this with my other account, and even tho everything was enabled on both ends, I still couldnt reshare. 2. When people are private it says no posts, not the privacy lock. I know Im not blocked by 40+ or however people because #1, I can request them #2 I can tag them #3 I can view their profile"
Great. Great on privacy
"Please fix. Im reporting that when I click on privacy blocked accounts more than half the accounts Ive blocked are not showing up in my list, but when I search for these accounts they show up and they say unblock user which means theyre blocked but I thought when you block a user they stay in your block list and you cannot see them in a search result and why when I click access data see blocked accounts all the accounts appear in that list but not the other one where I can see their profiles in the main list its strange and there has to be a glitch/bug that needs to be fixed immediately and to add also when I block more people the list wont show me the full amount of accounts Ive blocked  this has never happened to me before since the last update I never heard a response back from Instagram"
Bug or bad update?. Since The last update I cant seem to post multiple photos with in one post which is either a really bad update that has taken away this feature or its a bugAside from that the app is a really great tool however I really dont like the lack of privacy. The app listens too your convocations and then posts adverts relating to it and thats kinda of off putting
Suddenly started blocking me from reading anything I sent 10 message bubbles before. I have no idea how it protects my privacy by not letting me scroll up even a little in my DMs but this was my go to communication app and now I have no choice but to switch cause of ups inconvenient this sudden change is. Very disappointed
"Music option. I have a personal account and a business account, I cant add music to my reels or to my stories. I dont even have the music sticker option available"
please add this. I really want to see who doesnt follow me back on the app itself rather than downloading another app then having that hack me (has happened a bunch). im just a petty person wanted to unfollow the people who unfollowed me :)
THIS IS B.S. I forgot my password and i put forgot password Instagram wont send me a verification code to my email I dont have access to the phone number I have on my Instagram Its been almost a month since Instagram shut down and since then I cant log in to my Instagram
Makes me hate myself. The app has went down in quality and privacy over the years. Maybe a more user friendly atmosphere and user friendly interface would be helpful or just something friendly at all. This is the perfect app to use if you want to feel horrible about yourself and hate yourself. The app was designed perfectly in that sense
"I can't log out on my pbone. Hey Instagram, I cant log out of the account on my phone, or assets my profile to change my pictures"
Please fix. Wont upload videos on WiFi or data with full bars
"Not able to share other user's posts to my story. Instagram is great, however I&#39;ve been having issues with my account where it won&#39;t let me share other user&#39;s posts to my story. I have two accounts and it works for one but not for my personal account. Is there a fix?"
Getting added to message group with fake profiles. Keep a track on fake profiles adding people to scam them
"Posts not working. Everything is not so greatEver since I updated Instagram, none of the videos are playing on reels, posts, igtvs, or stories. Every video basically freezes after .5 seconds iv seen it. And I know its not a data problem either- I have storage. The only thing I can do now is add to my story or posts and messege people. I cant even look at video posts from people I follow, which include many famous artists. Please check to see if this is a technical glitch on your part"
. Very good. Hope it doesnt steal my data. 
"No Reels On New Accounts. I just created a new Instagram account to specifically watch &amp; post reels but for some reason, I cant see or create any reel videos.I looked online on how to fix this issue and NO LUCK.Deleted the App, Cleared all the Data, etc.Nothing workedReally disappointed"
Evil company. Deleted my last review so let\'s try this again.. This company is evil. Straight up. Only cares about harvesting data and building revenue. Can\'t choose ethical behavior and instead points the finger at governments for regulations. Just disgusting
"Suggestion. It would be beneficial to have an option for published reels to be made public without being in the public grid. Like when you go to your personal account, you have the personal grid, the reels, and then what you get tagged in? The reels tab should have the option to be made available to the public, as an easy access to see all the reels without it being mixed in with the other posts"
Good but not good. Im nota  fan of the new look it isnt very good but I do like the app idea I think I could some updates and it would something great it seems like Instagram isnt a huge priority right now to mark sucker ergo I dont think the app  Is good AT ALL I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON TUIS APP AND I WANT IT BACK ONE STAR FOR TRYING THATS ABOUT IT GOODDAY Amarx ZUCJEFBERG
My page was hacked and I know who did it. Ive been hacked I been emailing yall since Saturday telling you guys I been hacked I even forwarded emails Ive gotten from tnr hacker yall just let him come in swipe out my email and number Before I could even change my info Im really upset I want my page back
Personal account. I cant get into the personal account button. The picture of the person on the bottom right. It just takes me to a black screen. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. I have even turned off my phone and turned on. Nothing. How can this issue be fixed
hate yall. I had a business account so they took away my music and Ive switched back to a personal account but I still dont have my music back and I keep on deleting the app and signing out but NOTHING 
HATE latest update. The latest update has turned my feed into the explore page. I no longer enjoy using the app now that every handful of posts from friends is immediately followed by random posts by accounts I do not follow. I enjoy using the explore page and my personal feed SEPARATELY
"Help. Chile Ive been trying to create a personal Instagram account for months, but when I try to create one it says were sorry, but sometimes went wrong. Please try again"
Instagram Crashes. The Instagram App has been crashing when I try to open it for over a year now. I can get it to open and not crash some of the times I try to use it. Its really frustrating. Its completely updated and Ive tried using the app on cellular data and WiFi as well. It just shows the logo for about a minute on my phone screen and then it quits for me. Very disappointing
"Many problems with multiple accounts. Have had many problems with my business and personal accounts, support is nonexistent and the algorithm seems to always change in favor of not giving you exposure unless you pay"
"Notifications. The app is not sending me notis at all. I went to my personal settings and everything is fine, i went to indtagram settings and everything looks normal. I dont kno what the problem is, i only get notis when im on the app"
It keeps kicking me out. Hey I have been trying to get in instagram for the last hour and I still can get in I I deleted the app and downloaded the app again and still dont work what should I do? Plz answer back
"Why cant I see the likes on peoples posts?. I have two accounts, one is an art account and the other is a personal account and neither of them are private. I cant see how many likes the people I follow have on their posts on my personal account and I find it extremely annoying"
MY ACCOUNT IS HACKED AND IVE RECEIVED NO HELP. My instagram account was hacked a week ago. My username was changed as well as the email thats set in order to gain access via email. Ive submitted reports for this several times and when the got back to me they claimed the mistake was on my end. I dont know how to get my account back. HELP ME
"app crash. i am able to do as it is on my new iphone 11, however when i click my bio or personal data icon, it is not showing me anything but black page. please help coz i cant do anything on the settings of my account:("
FOLLERS. Following base is going down on both my account business and personal
"Instagram story music. I dont understand why this is happening but its very annoying I had a android before and used the same account my Instagram story has worked fine but then I got a iPhone and the Instagram story music wont play any sound I have tried everything I can and nothing works Update app, reinstall app, switch to personal account, etc"
whats happening?. the app doesnt download unless i give it my financial information. is this for real? its asking me to get apple credit card
Pathetic. Someone hacked my personal account and has been using my personal stuff and scamming my followers but I cant do anything about it not even delete my stolen account
Content creator here. I love Instagram but there are definitely some issues with glitching and reels editing. Sometimes my drafts dont save and or my captions. Also I wish there was a way to transfer drafts from one account to another (I have a personal and a beauty account)
"What can I do if I've lost access to the email or phone number I signed up with on Instagram?. The answer is nothing. Ive tried to update my phone number and email. I was sent a link to confirm it was me, when all of a sudden I was logged out. This has happened to me twice now, the first time was 09/08/21 on my main account the username is @jasswoods and now its on this account @therealtrilljass. I am not a bot or a hacker I do own both accounts, all I was trying to do was update my personal information like I thought I could, but now Im locked out of both accounts. So because I dont have any access to my old phone numbers or emails I cant even log into my accounts at all. Without having to this thing pop up asking for codes to my old emails and phone numbers I cant get access of in others words its almost impossible to log in"
"Lack. Please fix this issue, its a great app, but recently it giving me hard time to reload pic or videos even Im on unlimited internet data"
"Useless buttons, difficult to navigate. The update is terrible Whether using it for my personal or for my small business, this new update is the absolute worst Nobody needs the reels and shopping button front and center when we are just trying to post content. I no longer see posts from many of my friends. Instead I get the all caught up when I havent been on for a few days and clearly havent seen anything. Then I just see all the nonsense that would normally be in the explore tab crowding my feed. When I do see posts from my friends, its stuff from over a week ago, but nothing recent even though theyve posted only a few hours ago when I go directly to their page. For my business, interaction has all but completely disappeared. Whatever is going on with the new algorithm has made it so my followers dont see my new posts. This new update is utter crap"
Display Category. I love instagram but there is a glitch with the creator account. Even when you choose to not display the category for your creator account it still shows up. And even when i switched back to a personal account my category display was still there
"No captions on posts. I&#39;ve deleted and reinstalled this app several times and even cleared the data cache, but it seems that I am not longer able to caption my posts. I&#39;ve checked online for help, I&#39;m not over the hashtag limit and have not included anything that is considered restricted. Extremely frustrating"
"No support. My account was recently hacked and I have no way of receiving my info because of how old it was, so I want to make a new account but I still cant because of the lock screen"
"Fix your app. My account was COMPROMISED again. And I cannot sign into my account, because when I got to forget password and for the option to pick whether I want to use my email or username to sign in, why am I not allowed to choose my email. If I had a picture I would have attached it but, thats beside the point. The actual point is, FIX YOUR APP Im so tired of getting my account Compromised and not being able to send the link to my email. The chances of the actual people reading this is slim but at this point anything works. And instead of having the app focus on just anyone and then mistaking someone for for buying followers and likes, have it focus on the actual people who are doing that. I wholeheartedly want to keep using this app but the programming of it all just makes me hate it."
My account is hacked. Some low life jacked my account by using my friend picture and sending me some gmail linkI have email whats app called nothing what kind of company is this that you reach out for support and they dont answer back unbelievable and foul
"It gets worse after every update. IG isnt even used for pictures anymore, its basically a useless shopping app now. It gets worse after every update, its not even worth using anymore at this point"
BEING HACKED PLZ FIX NOW. IT SAYS LOOK WHAT SOMEONE DID WITH YOUR PICTURES THEN IT HAS U ENTER UR PASSWORD SO IT CAN HACK YOUR ACC PLZZZZZZ HELPPPPP
"Nope. I just recently got hacked, my email got changed and now I cant access my account anymore, I have told a lot of people to report that account but nothing is done, I know that it will be slow while the coronavirus is on but still, they should do something about it before something bad happens on my account. Im scared that they might have already hacked my email too. If you want to download Instagram you should probably rethink your choice"
Help plz. Ok so Ive contacted you guys like 5 times now about me getting a new phone and not being able to log back into my other account I can log into my main account fine just not my spam account and Ive sent yall the pictures with the cod and my username and my full name and Ive tried everything so Im asking you to plz help me
HARD TO RECOVER HACKED ACCOUNT. If your account has been hacked and you have tried to follow the steps online and in the help or support center well let me worn you NOW STOP . THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY STOP HELPING YOU AFTER THEY THINK THEY ARE DONE WITH YOU  Help is not on the way Right now a person is using my friends and family information to con them out of their money like they did me I have emailed Instagram on this for the last three days and no one is helping to stop the con man from using my account.  So if you see FOXY_PERCY. DONT follow because that is not me talking to you  That is a Con man and a hacker that just want money
"Apps not working. I love insta dont get me wrong, but I just tried to log on today and nothing would load. I couldnt post, I couldnt refresh the page, I couldnt do anything. So I restarted my phone and tried again, it still didnt work. I then turned off data and wifi then turned it back on, still didnt work, so I deleted the app and got it back and it wouldnt let me log in nor could I create a new account. It started to make me so mad I threw my phone across the room. I dont know whats happening but it needs to be fixed"
. i literally cant see none of my notifications unless someone tags me in a comment on my spam page @imslimescented and im not private so like. i needa see my notifications. my followers are active like. what am i supposed to do
I cant download. I was trying to download the app but it keep bringing me to the view the payment info and I just dont understand why I have to put in my payment info to download the app its very annoying
"Disable DMs option. Please provide an option to disable all DMs.I want to be able to post publicly but have no response options beyond likes, and maybe comments on the post. I want to avoid creepy AND overly-friendly personal interactions. None of the DM settings fit my purpose; sometimes, blocking or ignoring individuals causes far more harm than good... outside of the app.Ive had to abandon my Instagram (and my FB) because I cannot outright disable all DMs. I cant say to people I know, thats not a way to contact me."
There is always something wrong on this app. Multiple times before I couldnt access my direct messages for a while and another time I could like or follow anyone for 2 weeks. And now I cant ask for song suggestions on my main account but can on my private account
"Security level DOUBLE ZERO. Security of the app iz double ZEROIt is so easy to hack  Instagram n FB. Hackers need a minute to change all ur info and that they can do whatever woth ur account. For example sned messages in chat to ur friends askong for ccard info, codes etc....Will u gays ever wake up and bring the securoty level on 2 step verification or what??"
"Problem. This is a 12+ years app, I tried to download being 12 or over and for some reason the app wouldnt create me an account. After I put my info in, it said it was unable to create an account for me. Please fix this, I dont know why it didnt work"
"Buggy and no support. I run four different accounts (including two big name brands) and I have my own account as well. I have randomly lost the ability to share posts to my personal stories, despite making no privacy or settings changes and having just updated to the latest version. The other accounts work fine. Its super frustrating, especially when there is zero support available. Time to switch to email marketing completely so I dont have to rely on this buggy app as part of my marketing plan"
Trash app. Accounts are always being hacked its annoying learn how to make a good safe and secure app that isnt biased
"can't even open the app. every time i try and open the app , it takes me back to my home screen . it&#39;ll show the icon and &#39;instagram by facebook&#39; then after that it&#39;ll go right back to my home screen . i thought it was something going on with my phone so reset and restarted my phone . went to the app and nothing . i then was like okay well maybe i can uninstall it and reinstall and it&#39;ll work . i thought wrong , still doing the same thing . everything is updated , all of that and i still can&#39;t access anything on my phone , i have to use my macbook to even look at instead and it&#39;s not the app , it&#39;s the website so now i can&#39;t even post . this needs to be corrected asap . i have pictures that i want to post"
"No notifications. You guys update the app three times a week and you still cant fix the problem of people not getting notifications on the newest phones with the latest software. Plus, no matter how many times people contact you, you never respond.  The only good thing about you is that your service is free, unless you consider taking every detail of our lives and selling it to the highest bidder payment.  SMH"
Ive been having problems with the new update. Ive been having problems with the new update where I dont have access to the new story fonts. I deleted the app restarted my phone and downloaded again. And I also deactivated my Instagram and still
"No Option to Share Posts to Story. My personal account does not allow the option to share posts to my stories. I can with other accounts, just not with my personal account. I have tried every possible solution. The app and all my devices are fully updated"
"No Access to Reshare to Story Button. Ive looked up all the supposed fixes to this and guides on how to reshare others posts to your story. However on my art account @caramelcoda I dont have access to it. This is frustrating as I use Instagram for business. I can reshare to my story on my personal account but not my other account.Apparently its a common issue I just really want to get it fixed... Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling, toggling the button, downloading later updates and logging in again. PLEASE FIX THIS"
Sad. After the first account refused to let me in. Which I only accessed once.  And deleting and downloading the app upwards of ten times.  It finally let me open another account.  It wont let me use password generator with the iPhone.  For an app that requires this amount of personal information the security is really seriously bad.  Would not recommend to anyone that has sensitive info on their device.  Or use separate device with no info on it to access
"Customer service is absolutely horrible. Im, like, 99.9% sure that Ive completely lost my account at this point. I had turned on the two factor authentication feature and had saved the back up codes on my old phone. I then lost that picture when I got my new phone. Then my authentication app ended up logging me out. On top of that Instagram then also logged me out. Ive been trying to get back into my account for months now with no luck. There is nothing on the help center that can help with this issue and that is virtually the only thing that they give for help. I tried to report the issue through the app about four times and got nothing there. I tried calling them and got an automated response saying that they arent taking calls. There isnt a support email. There is literally virtually no way to contact them for help. I cant even delete the account and make another one"
"Instagram Music Isnt Available In My Region But Im In The USA. Hey good day Instagram, I recently came back from vacation. I went to Guyana(country in South America) and Im back in Queens, Ny. When I was in vacation I already knew you couldnt use music so I really didnt mind at all. My problem is that ever since I came back to Queens, the music isnt available in my region even thought Im in the Us. I logged into my account on my iPad and the music button was available on the device but for my phone the music button wasnt even appearing and its not on the stickers button. Ive deleted the app multiple times, reinstalled it, and tried using data at home but nothing was working. A strange thing also is when I carry my phone to go out to the gas station or the mall Ill be using the cellular data and the music button is appearing but as soon as I come back home the music button isnt appearing no more. Please help me as soon as you guys can"
"Version 203.0 uses up 25GB of storage. The title says it all. I updated my app and then immediately got a low storage notification on my phone. Turns out IG was using 25GB (all contained within documents & data), which is just absolutely ridiculous. Ive never deleted an app from my phone so quickly in my life"
Not a good app at all. Logs me out all the time and lost all my followers and conversations 
La mejor red social. 100% recomendada .. es lo máximo para uso personal y profesional

"Unable to access my personal grid. Updated x3. Uninstalled and reinstalled. And STILL unable to access my personal grid ... when I tap on the person icon the screen goes black and nothing responds. I cant access my posts, settings or saved posts. Everything just goes black. Only way to re-access the app is to close completely and re-open. FIX IT PLEASE. (iPhone SE 2020)"
music. the only gave me access to royalty free music from facebookso i switched back to a personal account and it still wont go back to normal. im annoyed
horrible. they watch u while ur on ur phone

"Very Many Issues with IOS 15. Firstly, Instagram will not redirect me when i click on a notification in my notification bar. Then insta will not load AT ALL whether on great wifi connection nor cellular data. So then i deleted the app completely and restarted my phone and NOW i cant even log in at all. The app keeps saying &#34;We&#39;re sorry but something went wrong. Please try again&#34;. Now im just completely locked out of instagram. I really hope the issues can be fixed very soon and coordinate with Apple Inc. updates as this app is extremely important to the billions of users on the platform. Yet seems to crash all the time"
"Crash issue. Anytime I try to add photos to my account...the entire app crashes. I can upload a photo or two but if I do anymore than that at once under select multiple...the app crashes. I can turn my iPhone off and on, delete the app, re-download the app...still crashes. What is up Instagram? Its been happening for months now. I have plenty of storage on my phone and all apps are up to date. Other than this huge problem....I like this app. But, this is a picture/video app yet I cant add any...whats the point?"

"Change . the option that i can only change my name twice in 14 days is absolutely ridiculous. im making an account for my art and im figuring what looks best and i cant even do that because i can only change it TWICE.Also it would be nice to have the option of keeping who you follow private. The privacy would be ideal for those with many followers, they could follow there family at peace, and such. Please, deeply consider these"

Horrible security. Im constantly getting emails saying Im having trouble logging in which Im not so must be someone else trying to log in. Ive tried several times to set up two step authentication but it just simply does not work. It gives you two options: 1 is to get a code sent to your phone( you never get the code even even after checking the phone number is correct) 2 is to download their recommended authenticator app which it doesnt recognize youve downloaded. So Im stuck having to change my password every single time I get one of these sorry youre having trouble signing in emails. Im about to just delete the whole app. Ive seen a lot of people getting hacked and clearly security is not a priority for Instagram
"Reel. Hi,I have two accounts 1 for business and one personal. Im unable to use the insta reel audio feature on my business account. But I can use it on my personal and I need this fixed. Ive tried everything possible but nothing works. Any idea how I can fix this issue?"
"DUMB & Annoying. Each user experience is different  Been a member from the beginning of IG &amp; LoVeD the simplicity of the program &amp; hardly any ads.  But now, its getting messy, full of clutter, too much like FB  &amp; I dont FB  The latest update Suggestion on my personal feed of people to follow that I DONT KNOW is really DUMB &amp; Annoying    I dont know these people &amp; dont care  Keep it simple Reduce the Clutter"

"iPhone 7 usage. Please make sure the app works for those with the older version of an iPhone but have updated their iOS. The app keeps closing so stop toggling the sites data. Everyones online, you guys are making more money than ever and can afford to give us full use of the site. Thanks"
wierd. all ive been hearing about this is that yall use our camera and microphone to track us i dont really appreciate that can u plz stop
"Reels. I have two accounts and only my personal one has the reels update as of December 31st 2020. My business account (which is the one I wanna use the reels) doesnt seem to have the correct updates: reels dont show on feed , just on reels tab. No updates available on App Store... Im confused as to why one account it works but not the other one?"
Followers. Why does it show wrong count of followers ? Im following 668 but shows 741 is there a reason why ? Ive removed app clear data ect and still shows the same
"Great app, annoying updates. So I love this app, I use it for my business and personal however my business account doesnt have reels yet and my personal does. Im an artist so having reels would be incredibly beneficial to my business but despite updating the app, uninstalling then reinstalling, switching my phone on and off, I still dont have it"
Stop tracking. Stop tracking
My Rating. You guys are allowing a lot of hacking to happen And you guys arent doing anything about it There is no warnings How are people able to go into your account and change your email and your phone number without verification to the original phone number and email that was on the account
"App on iPhone frozen. Instagram has been frozen on my phone all day. Ive tried switching WiFi networks, using data, restarting my phone and uninstalling and reinstalling the app and none of those have done anything"
"Great App - Terrible support. Completely useless support, as well as lack of useful information in FAQ makes it user unfriendly whenever you have difficulties with your account"
"instagram music. ive had a professional account so i could see my insights and up until now ive gotten this weird music in facebooks sound library on my private account my music is normal, and i tried redownloading my app and switching my account tyoe to private, personal, business and still nothing. is this some sort of glitch?"
Error. I love using IG but here&#39;s the thing; i can&#39;t react to any post while using with wifi but when i switch to mobile data i can react without any trouble.  Please look into this error altho i reported that error many times nothing happened
"Roll out Mass Access to Reels Already. I have two accounts, a personal one Ive had since 2013 and one for my dogs I started in 2019 as a creator account. My personal account got Reels as soon as it was introduced to the US, where Im based, but now Im still here, six months later, and my dog account still doesnt have access to Reels. It has the new garbage layout with the shopping tab (that my personal account doesnt have), but still no access to Reels. Both app and phone are kept up to date on auto updates. I understand not all accounts get Reels, but at least do the bare minimum of keeping connected accounts the same"

"Please help me. I have been locked out of my account for almost a month now and there is no proper customer service to help me retrieve my account back. This hacker changed my password, email, and phone number associated with my account. The selfie video submissions are all coming back as though they arent recognizing me to verify that its really me even though I have a ton of photos of myself on my profile. I have tried to resubmit selfie verification videos time and time again and now I try to submit and an error message pops up. I have resorted to emailing the 2 emails available on the self help section of the app but no response. I am very disappointed in this company. I really want my account back and my photos. Or at the very least to have my old account taken down because the hacker is using my personal photos to post on my storyline and post about crypto currency which I dont even believe in. They are also sending my friends and family scam messages"
"Can't post pics. My business account was made and in 3 weeks I all of the sudden couldn&#39;t post pictures In the middle button with the + sign is now a Video play button If I hit it, it wants to play videos  Now, on my personal account, which I&#39;ve had for 5+ years, it has ALSO removed my ability to post pictures There&#39;s that stupid PLAY button again. I&#39;ve cleared the IG Cache on my phone, no luck. I&#39;ve uninstalled and reinstalled, no luck. WTH INSTAGRAM????"
Helping those who have been hacked?. I got hacked on 1/4/22. Ive done the account recovery and even put in a claim and I havent heard back yet. Its 1/18/22 How long does this usually take? I have 10 years worth of my childrens pictures on there that I cant control
Deleting of accounts. Few people globally are  complaining  about their pages deleted and sadly am one of them which I find very difficult to accept because both my tech page and personal business page has been deleted its heartbreaking (_miz_aj and hub_concept )
"PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS BUG. I CANT ADD POSTS TO MY MAIN PROFILES STORY. I have several accounts and they let me add different posts to my story BUT MY MAIN ACCOUNT, I CANT. PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS. It has nothing to do with privacy settings, if the account I am trying to post is on private, or if my story settings are set differently. Nothing has changed. PLEASE. FIX"
"Can no longer repost. I can no longer repost a persons photo to my stories. I have two accounts (one for business) and Im able to do this function on that account. But, not on my personal account"
"Amazing. I love the latest updates, I love the app and information that is so readily available on any topic"
Just horrible. It is a horrible environment and steal information. Always changing format and makes it very glitchy and annoying
lame. youre selling your soul to this app they watch your eyes
"Story photo quality issue. Ive been using Instagram forever and otherwise enjoy the app however Ive noticed when I post a photo on my story alongside any of instagrams stickers it will drastically reduce the quality of the photo to the point where its blurry. At first I thought it was my connection or cropping of the pic until I noticed it was only happening on photos with stickers. Im using an iPhone 12 Pro and app is up to date, I have strong WiFi and data. Data on app is not reduced either &amp; photo size is not too large so its definitely a sticker issue. Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this. Please fix because I love adding stickers to my story Thanks"
"Stop changing the app. The recent updates have been nothing but stupid. Ive had this app since I was around 10 years old and its never been this bad, Ive had like 3 updates in the span of 48 hours... and everything has moved and the layout is ridiculously useless. MOVE THE NOTIFICATIONS BACK I dont see the point of moving everything. The shopping tab is where the notifications were, does anyone actually use the shopping tab? All I could wish for is the last layout of Instagram where its simple and easy to use"
"Sharing posts to story NOT WORKING. My personal account has not been able to share anyones posts to my story. Any other account I try on, that Im also logged into, allows me to do so. But I messaged Instagram and they havent responded and I cant share posts to my story still. Had this problem for like a month now"
No music. I read that business accounts cant play music but when I change to personal or artist page Im still not allowed Whats the deal
"Yes. Ive never had a problem with Instagram before, but today when I posted on my Park Jimin fan account (ParkJimindLeftEyebrow), Instagram logged me out of my account for suspicious actions when Ive done nothing different to what I do on my personal account. I had to log back in and do the robot thing to show I wasnt a robot and now Im blocked from liking posts and posting more. Its just really annoying because Ive done nothing wrong"
Love it. I love IG for personal and professional use
Terrible. My family IG has been hacked and I report daily. You guys do nothing. But my work page that is private and I wear pasties you will totally delete page then we are screwed
"cant repost other stories. I normally love instagram its a great way to share my life with all my friends. One thing i dont like is i dont have the option to repost certain peoples stories to my own. normally I wouldnt care, assuming its a privacy setting on the other persons account but other people are able to share the same story i try to share. it gets frustrating"
"my account. For the last week I havent been able to get into my account. It tells me that my account has been disabled. Considering the terms, Im a minor and cant even do anything bad enough for my account to be disabled. Ive tried to make multiple accounts online and through the app on my phone and nothing has worked. Ive never had any problems with the app nor the updates made. But this act was very unprofessional. I dont think Ill ever use the app again unless this problem gets fixed. Im afraid someone has hacked my account and taking my personal information. You guys need better security measures. Do better smh"
"I need help with my account. I made the mistake of using a made up email to make my account and now that I want to make it all legit by using a real email and linking it , I cant. Instagram has now kicked me out of the page saying I need to verify the account with the original email. I know my password , I even sent my personal information to get verified. If there was actual support I could at least explain the situation and verify that I do in fact own the account. THIS IS BEYOND FRUSTRATING. I built a unique brand name and now I cant even access MY account anymore"
"Feedback. Love the app, been using it since 2015. But i do think you should create an option where we can synchronize 2 accounts and all its data into one account. I switched account multiple times &amp; i regret because now i cant view the memories Hope u take my feedback into consideration"
Account. This app is terrible randomly logs me out of my account and even though I have all my login info saved I still cant access it
"Put Zuckerberg in his place. Do you like having your data stolen and sold to the highest bidder? Then go ahead and download this nearly blatant malware. Oh, whats that? Nearly everyone has it? Shame"
"Stupid. Cant share posts to my story,  I can on another account but not my personal one  Please fix this, Ive updated to the latest update as well"
Still can't repost personal nor others stories. Since the updates that have been released during July/August my ability to repost my own pictures or others posts is no longer available. I can only send DM Messages. Please fix
". So today when I tried to get on the app it wouldnt even let me go onto it, it booted back to my home screen and Ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it turned off my WiFi and data and restarted my phone,,, I would appreciate if you were to fix this problem"
"Problems. I literally cant even open Instagram.. it keeps crashing. I tried deleting it and downloading it back, I tried restarting my phone.. I even redid all data and settings and still nothing. When the update came out people were saying that it messed the app up but later on when I tried logging on again it crashes over and over again"

"Spam accounts ridiculous. Ive literally had to put my account on private and turn off messages to get the spam accounts to leave me alone and it STILL doesnt work. Im constantly reporting fake accounts that watch my stories and add me into fake group chats and Instagram does absolutely nothing and no one can blame covid for it anymore because weve all been back to work for a while now. Even before covid, nothing was ever done about it. I dont understand what else I can do to get it to stop"
"Better hope your email doesnt get hacked. I lost my email account a couple months back. When i changed my Instagram account from the old email to the new email, they wanted verification from the old one i no longer had access to. NO real customer service phone number and they NEVER respond to emails So now i can never access my account again Thanks Instagram Ill be deleting you after this review"
"wont let me change my profile picture. says there is a problem with the connection and i should check it and try again despite having a strong connection to the interest and does not let me change my profile picture. i have tried updating the app, logging in and out, and changing to data or wifi and it still isnt fixed. i searched online and it seems some other people had this same issue a year ago and couldnt find a fix. i hope this bug can get addressed asap thanks"
"UPDATE NEEDED. I have two accounts, one personal (private) and one business (public). On my personal account, I am able to add posts to my story but on my business account, I do NOT have this feature. FIX IT I have read that many users are facing the same issue with no solution. Very frustrating"
Video selfie verification. My account asked me to verify with a video selfie asking me to move my face in several directions. When I go to submit it it says upload error. There is no way around the error. I have lost access to my account and there is no way to use the app now on my phone. I use the app for business so this is a huge problem and they have no one to contact
"Some things dont work. Im so frustrated, I have two accounts, one personal, one business. My personal has soooo many more features than my business account does. I cant do music on business, I cant do certain features, whereas my personal can. So stupid- and its updated fully"

Doesnt help with problems. My account has been hacked and the help center isnt much of a help to my problem this isnt the first time Ive been hacked on this app and theres no way for me to recover my account
terrible. terrible app does not respect users privacy. Update is cral. Just matter of time before people stop i sing app
Music not working. Ive made sure Instagram was up to date and Ive deleted Instagram and reinstalled it but nothing works but whats going on? When I try to add a sound it doesnt load and I have good WiFi/ data sometimes when I look up the sound it works but its getting on my nerves now and thinking about deleting Instagram completely because of the countless bugs Instagram has with posts and when I look on others stories plus the music thing
"I was enjoying Insta until you removed reels. Hi, I have multiple business accounts and a personal account. You removed all of my reel features after using them on all but 1 account. Can I please get them back"
"Multi million dollar crap. Another way to shove down your throat Ad, and spy on you"
"Horrible Quality Photos. After I post a nice quality photo that I took with my iPhone, the photo gets blurry. Ive changed all my setting but nothing helps. What is the point of purchasing $1000 phones that take incredible photos if we cant even share them on social media without having that quality compromised? Horrible for businesses and content creators"

"Wheres the music sticker?. I have been trying to get the music sticker to add songs to my story and its not there. I changed my account from business to personal, and nothing My app is up to date. Help plz"
"Problems With This App. I had made a new personal last week and if I like a few posts, I get put on temporary action block. On my other account, I can like as many posts as I want too"
"Combining the carousel feature and the archive feature. Instagrams addition of the carousel feature and the archive feature have been incredible, giving users more options and flexibility on their posts. I wish however that photos within a carousel post can be individually archived instead of only being able to archive the whole past altogether. This would mean even more freedom and control over our own posts and enhance the user experience and flexibility"
Hacked. I had my personal profile hacked and now it keeps coming up a message... help us confirm your account and cant get back in load of rubbish
Failed. Try to share from album. Says have to open app and sign in. Its open and Im signed in. Try to add photos from app. Tells me to go to privacy and let app save photos. Its already set that way. Couldnt share and couldnt upload and wasted x amount of time picking out photos and all I got was clicking ok ten times because of whatever that privacy bug was
"Instagram crashing. I haven't been able to reopen my Instagram account from my personal cell phone for 2 months. He crashes all the time. I already wrote for help but no one answers.

"Why is the add to my story button not there?. Ive had no issues with Instagram so far on my personal account, but on my new account, linked with my personal, it doesnt let me add a post to my story. Ive fully updated Instagram, yet this is still happening. Instagram, please fix this"
"Music. Not playing on Cellular data, but only on WiFi, pls fix it to play on data"
I dont want to shop. Apparently I was chosen to test out a new shopping feature on IG. I didnt get a notification or anything and I hate it. I also cant turn it off. I definitely would never give my shopping info to IG seeing as in accounts get hacked constantly. You moved all my buttons Put them back
This app is toxic. This app is toxic its not good for children it hurts you brain self esteem but not all of it is bad but most of it is it only shows the good parts of youre life. Its also a main factor in mental health struggles this app is tracking you and showing you information that you like
"App crashes while editing reel. Instagrams app quality is questionable nowadays. Not tiktok fan but hate to say tiktok app is performing much better than Instagram. Mark, instead of stealing data focus on keeping your own products with good quality"
I agree with that first review. I have 3 accounts personal business and creator and when I switch over all updates are not the same. It literally took half a year for my to get the feature on my main account where you cant see the words typing as you type in your keyboard yet my business page had that feature
Love this but. I cant get music tab on my work account. But can on my personal have sent requests to support for help w no response. My clients personalities could be better represented if this feature worked properly
"DUMB & Annoying. Each user experience is different Been a member from the beginning of IG & LoVeD the simplicity of the program & hardly any ads. But now, its getting messy, full of clutter, too much like FB  & I dont FB The latest update Suggestion on my personal feed of people to follow that I DONT KNOW is really DUMB & Annoying I dont know these people & dont care Keep it simple Reduce the Clutter"
Dont download. People have cp selling accounts and nude accounts and its Disgusting
Wayyyy too many adds. Very tired with seeing public pages posting half naked pictures of women and then seeing them on the discovery page. I feel like I cant find any way to avoid itI have been getting group message requests multiple times a day from spam accounts. I block all of them but then new ones message me. My account is private but Im tired of trying to avoid getting these invites sent to me
"Biased fact check, censorship of data. What happened to free speech? You cant censor anything your Zionist creators dont agree with. By trying to silence people you are just making it even clearer that Zionists are the oppressors and racist inhumane monsters and modern day Nazis. Congratulations on proving your lack on humanity and cementing the fact you are extremely racist"
"Broken Feature Since 2018. I am unable to share any post to my story. I am unable to even share my own. I have updated the app, checked my privacy settings. I am able to share posts on one of my other accounts. This needs to be fixed"
"Bad app support. My account literally got hacked and started messaging people for my personal information. There is no way to contact support besides email. There should be a phone number to call, because I dont know how to fix this, the form I filled out solved nothing"
Lack of support. Absolutely no support if you have trouble logging into your account. Ive got a new phone number and now Ive lost access and my support requests have been ignored for over 8 months
"Still cant log in. After a week, i still cant log in using the app. Im still given a message stating ERROR. Sorry there was a problem with your request . Ive been forced to use my BROWSER in order to access my account.. please fix this. I really LOVE Instagram, its one of the only apps I use 24/7...Update: Ive contacted Instagram and even gone thru extreme lengths by buying a new phone and yet I am still unable to log in"
"Seriously horrible update. This new update is so bad, I hate that now if I go to see trending posts is not there anymore now is all reels like if I wanted reels or videos like that O wouldve gotten Tik Tok, Im not saying dont have it, Im sure is fun and it adds more to Instagram but dont make the whole feed about reels what about my normal posts like pictures that are trending from celebrities or fan pages etc. Also, this last couple of years Instagram personal feel (where you go to see what the people you follow post) is so bad it never updates and is never in order. I am seeing things from a week ago that I have already seen and when I refresh the page even more older things pop up instead of the new posts. I am really disappointed with Instagram is trying to be so cool and stay trending that is just becoming annoying"
Music button gone from my business account. Works on my personal account for stories but not anymore on my business account
"Hide likes and views. Either you make a feature accessible to everyone at once, or you dont roll it out at all. Its been months since the feature was announced and yet accounts like mine, which have been active since the very beginning of the platform, still dont have it. Not to mention the degradation in UX choices made within the app layout in general. Why do we have to jump through so many loops and tap so many elements to get to what used to be simple bottom nav destinations? Make all accounts have this navigation: Settings > privacy > posts > toggle likes and views visibility"
"Never give up on Palestine. Hey Instagram, deleting hashtags related to Palestine to hide the crimes done by the Israelis makes you one them, criminals against humanity"
"Notification malfunction. I have two accounts. One for my art and one for my personal use. Every time I go on my art account, it says I have a dm message on my personal account. I am an OCD person and seeing that notification always being there irks me so much. Ive tried everything. Ive cleared all my dms, checked my message requests and even looked at IGTV and it just wont go away. This is my only issue with Instagram. Its been like this for a while now-months actually. Instagram is my main social media to use but please... Fix this"
Completely not working on my device. Cant access my personal account
"Reshare. The reshare is button for stories is useful if youve seen something on your feed that you want to share and then youve lost it. But, not being able to share other peoples posts and stories to your stories with the share button is incredible frustrating If I see something I want to share I want to share I there and then, not faff around looking for the reshare button (which looks like all the other buttons) in the stickers menu in stories. Too complicated"
"Why I cant log in through the app. This has been happening for a couple of weeks now, ever since I logged out because the app was acting crazy I havent been able to log back in through the app, i have no problem accessing my account through the browser or the app on another phone but on my phone it always says   an error occurred  Ive try everything nothing seems to work plus instagram never responds in help center, this is annoying please help "
"Please fix. I have 2 accounts, a personal account and a hobby account one I can share stories on and share to feed and the other I cant, both continuous stories end after 4 frames, its so frustrating Im guessing its to try and push us to use IGTV but how about giving us the option? Please fix me being able to share posts to my story, I cannot even share my own posts to my story and its only a problem on one account Fix please its getting on my nerves"
Hacked account. Someone else has taken over my account with this app 
"Fake accounts. Too many fake accounts, completely destroying the experience Every second notification is a spam account wanting to follow me. What a waste of time"
Way too many ads. Privacy control setting broken. I see Please try again later. instead of ability of control privacy settings
"Why fix whats not broken?. Why change the interface so much? It was fine. I hate the new moved notifications button, I have to go home every time then check them. When I had access always previously. And I have a personal and a biz account. I can no longer add music on the stories of my IG account. I used to be able to at least a month or two ago. Why change? It was crucial to some of my stories for my business. And theres no explanation or help online or from IG, so Im coming here"
"Every time I deactivate, I keep being logged back in. I keep deactivating my account for personal reasons, and every time I reset my phone, or update the app, Instagram logs me back in and I have to wait a week. There is no, would you like to log in to this account? option. Instead, it automatically states that it is logging me in to that account. Im beyond frustrated and am considering deleting the account altogether"
Awesome. This app shares personal experiences and you can also message without paying
Music not be able to have it on stories for public accounts. Ik it kinda hard to explain but it will only have like certain background music and k pop and it wont let me choose any other music anymore. I tried reinstalling it many times and still no change and I tried turning it into a personal and nothing it been like this for almost two weeks. So I have it under a creator account now and still nothing
Bad. Me and my best friend hacked twice we aint give out our information wEre not the only ones

"HELP. My account doesnt work at ALL anymore I cannot send messages, like, or even view my personal info or saved. It said I had entered my password to get free followers when I NEVER did that. I want my account back. Please help insta"
my insta wont work anymore. all my other apps work properly but everytime i try to log in insta says no internet connection even if im on data (everything else works so im sure its not my phone) i cant use insta anymore because it doesnt let me log in to any account
"New layout isnt good. I love instagram and use it for both personal and business, however the new layout isnt great. The middle icon shouldnt be reels, it should be upload with a choice to create a reel. The middle right icon shouldnt be shop, notifications should be there like it always has done and shop should be at the top where notifications now is. Please fix this asap"
"please fix the notification. im a kpop fan since 2017 and instagram is were i can see my faves personal updates, and now that their app for idol is soon to be gone, instagram is the only way to communicate them thru their instagram live, however whenever theyll go live, i get the notification late or sometimes i cant get any notifications, please fix it"
"No notifications anymore. Since the last update came out, I havent gotten ANY notifications. Ive uninstalled the app, restarted my phone, logged out of all of my accounts, messed with settings both in and out of the app,  and still no notifications. Please fix this. I use Instagram to help sell art and I cant do that when Im not getting notifications. My suggestion is; stop adding features no one wants and fix this broken app"
"Problems since new update. I love Instagram for business but ever since I updated it last time my Followers and following numbers have disappeared (from my view only) and a red highlight across the top keeps saying something went wrong please try again. My shopping tab has also disappeared which is extremely frustrating as I use this for business. I have tried everything and cant fix it ~ cleared the cache, rid of extra data, reinstalled app and nothing. My biggest gripe is that you send an email to support asking for help and nothing happens... you are just stuck with the issue. Im not sure what to do but support would be good :) other than that I love Instagram"
"Hacked. My Instagram was literally hacked by someone in Russia. They changed my password and my name. When I tried to change the password back, it sent my email address and password attempt to the email in Russia. I know it was Russia because the site showed the last activity on the account and put a pin on the map in Russia...email address was in Russian language. At the time, I tried for well over an hour to find help, there was no person to call or online troubleshooting for how to fix my account. I deleted all of my pictures and deleted the app. Basically, they still have it..and I cant get Instagram for my business because my phone still remembers the deleted app. I see no way of starting a new account. Ps I am friends with all of my childs friends so Russia is watching them too.Any suggestions for how to start a new IG with new email on my same phone?"
"notifications. Yet again im writing to say that your notifications spams are annoying, fix it"
"Business Account Music. My personal account IG music functions perfectly, however in my business account it stalls and will not let you browse or search. Fix it please"
"Notifications. Its been 2 MONTHS and Im not receiving any notifications from the app although everything is on and right I even contacted Apple and restored my phone, deleted and downloaded the app again. NOTHING IS WORKING  FIX IT"
"i am not happy at all right now. i have had instagram for a very very long time, i am a huge fan of the app HOWEVER, i started unfollowing many people in instagram bc i dont enjoy having my following number so high. i unfollowed around 100 ish people, and suddenly instagram told me to change my password because i had been hacked no problem i enter my password and it says its incorrect, i hit forgot my password and send it to my number and it doesnt work and says its an invalid link. ive never had this issue before? usually it says i cant unfollow anymore people if i hit the max number. im unsure of what to do besides make a new account which i cant do due to my email and phone number already being associated with my account. very irritated and now no longer can use their app/website. unfortunate because i use it often and loved the app before this"
"Glitches and issues. I have been having a lot of problems with my app. I have reported the issue numerous times with no improvement or responseI have a personal and business account and my notifications stopped working. I dont get notified of likes, comments and or direct messages on either account. This was working perfectly fine before. I am also unable to send a message to someone when replying to their story. This is creating problems with my business with me not responding to my customers in a timely manner. Please advise"
"Needs improvement. Cant upload full photo.  Photo gets zoomed into without remedy.  I love this app, i prefer more of the photo to upload.  It says no one sees what you save, but Instagram needs to fix that too.  Need more privacy control"
Dont wait to enjoy your personal account. Its very nice and enjoyable
Cant even get my account back. If you get disabled then its game over man Ive tried everything in my life to get my account back which I am a producer and I need that account for communication with other producers and stuff but now its just another give away 3 years for nothing all for a post that was In my personal dms that no one reported that wasnt even that bad
add yours sticker bug???. I tun an account for my high school class and a personal account. The high school instagram page has updated with the new stickers and new tool bar in story but my personal account hasn't. super frustrating
817princesscuts. I have been hacked and I dont have access to my business account. I cant seem to get in contact w support this is really unbelievable
Unable to access since updates. Cant access account. My passwords are saved to my phone. I get an error message and kicked out and then it freezes Contacted IG with everything to prove it is my account...still wont let me access. I even had to submit a picture of myself and still no access. I even asked for password help the email they send the link to does not belong to me Im not sure what they have done but the update is pathetic
"Reels. I have a personal/private account, and two public accounts (a writing page and a music page).My personal account allows me to post 60 second reels, my writing account doesnt even have access to reels, and my music account only goes up to 30 seconds, not 60 like the new updates mention. Its not a localization thing, because Ive been in the same city for every account creation, so this is just something wrong with the app. This has been going on since the release of 60 second reels. What can yall do to help fix this?"
Problem with following hashtags. This is such a pain. I am unable to reshape anything to my story and unable to follow some hashtags from a personal account. I have 2 accounts and both are private and I just see why the normal story sharing feature and following hashtags dont work. I have send feedback multiple times but it doesnt work
Hackers. Its a great app but its not very serious on its rules my account got hacked and I wasnt able to retrieve it because all the information was changed I have reported the account multiple times but still nothing its still up and running and he is still scamming people andTaking their accounts as well could you please delete the account before anybody elses get hacked its Makiyahere
"No new fonts. I have two accounts on Instagram, my personal one has been updated with the new fonts but my other account still hasnt received the new fonts - when am I going to get them?"
Could be better. Im locked out of my primary account and with my information and several emails no one is helping me to get back in my account
Its actually disgusting. Plus they spy also
"Similar updates. I love instagram but I hate that no two accounts have the same update. I have a personal and a creator account, and my creator one is updated to the newest version but my personal one isnt. Its annoying that their not the same. You should fix that"
Problem. Im having problem with my personal account its says I have 5 messages but theres nothing there
"Unwanted Email Notifications. Today I got an email notification addressing that I have been having trouble signing in to my account. I have no problem signing in and I know this one user who is harassing me by sending me multiple unwanted emails notifications. This user @sh1_2344 is abusing the Instagram login page forgotten password reset request button. In order to bully and harass me. 4 months ago back in May or March spring season we both agreed to apologize and move on with ourselves with peace because of an altercation that we had between each other. I thought that was resolved and I admitted that what I did was wrong and she forgave me. Right after that I noticed she threaten to report me to her authorities before blocking me and she secretly blocked other accounts of mine and my moms account. She had been harassing me and my mom before by sending multiple emails and text notifications abusing the Instagram login password page. Trying to hack my account please, have this user banned for harassment"
"FIX. literally nothing works when i click on it. feed wont refresh, nothing. it only works when I use data but i dont want to resort to this. This has been happening for 2 days now. please fix, its the only app thats being problematic"
"Updates. I have two accounts. My main account and my spam account (jus posting memes and weird and off pics of me.) I have noticed my spam account is up-to-date but my main account is not. I have recently updated my phone to see if that worked but it didnt. My second account can change the shape of my pictures when I tap it, but on my first account it wont let me. I just want my main account to be up-to-date"
Hacked account. You allow these scammers to just go ahead and try to lure people in their trap. I think you guys should upgrade and make sure accounts like these arent allowed. My account Ive had since 2016 got hacked and changed all my information to where I cant login on my phone and i am very upset
"Doesnt work. App is not loading.  I deleted it twice, re-started my phone and nothing.  Doesnt work with wifi or regular phone data"
business account glitch. I got notified that i couldnt use music on to my stories anymore since i was a business account. I decided to switch to a personal one and go private. I thought it would work but i still had bad non copyright music. I decided to delete the app and it still didnt work. Ive seen probably 1 review about this issue and its frustrating me because nothing comes up on google to help me as well. I hope it gets fixed soon
"Love the app with one issue. Ive had insta for a long time and really have no complaints until recently. I noticed some of my friends had guides and I wanted to make one on my business account. So I switched from my personal account to the business one, clicked the plus in the corner and noticed there was no option for creating a guide. On my personal accounts I have the option, but not on my business one? It doesnt make sense. I did all kinds of research, seeing if I could resolve the issue with no luck. Im not really sure what to do. Like I said, I love the app, but this is really upsetting and getting on my nerves"
My personal account 07704874919.  
Spies. Spies
Layout issues. Dont see why you have decided to move my uploading and personal photo likes buttons onto the home icon page as it was always logical to work from my personal page. Also mixing up new items with ones I have seen many times leaves me scrolling for ever and I eventually get fed up and wonder if Ive missed any new posts from people I follow. Ever thought of leaving the interface as it was ....putting all the new posts together at the top of the feed as it used to be or do you just enjoy annoying users to get a reaction?
Changing foe worse. I dont like the latest update. Its changed the app from a personal space where I post my photos and interact with friends into a noisy shopping mall where endless strangers are trying to sell me something
"Love it, but I hate the followers service hacking your account. They will literally sell followers, and then all of a sudden you are following a bunch of new people you dont even know. "
Cant repost on my story. I use to be able to repost posts on my story and now I cannot and I dont have the feature in my settings to fix the issue.. like come on Instagram youre better than this. Yes I checked if their acc was private or notYes I checked with several main big accounts Yes I checked with diff posts Yes I checked settings &gt;privacy&gt;story Pls fix
"Love this app but I have an issue. I don&#39;t know why but since yesterday my Instagram seemed like the update for messenger cross app got disabled or something, for example I can no longer see the chat themes ect. I can see in my user data that the update is in fact downloaded but I cannot use the benefits of this update. Pls fix it or contact me to fix it. Have a good day"
Problem. For some reason my account cant share posts on my story. Works on my personal account but not myMain one
mysterious notification counter. i get numbers appearing on the account tab but when i hold down to see which accounts have notifications none of them have counters next to themi have gone into every account to look for activity and messages and cant find anything so infuriating as keeping track of everything on my phone is time consuming already
"Problem with dms. I love the app, my only problem is dms, I have 4 accounts: 2 for personal use, 1 for social media and another for art. On every one, messages sent by me are different colours, one is blue, one is grey and another is purple"
"Upgrade has degraded app integrity. The update is so stupid & has a terrible layout. Difficult and inconvenient to access your notifications and post or make a story.hate hate HATE the shopping feature that is placed where notifications used to be, to make you click on in. If I wanted to do online shopping, I wouldnt be on instagram"
Cant share stories. Ive spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out the problem. The button doesnt even appear as an option for me. Only can PM stories to others. Privacy settings are not the issue
"Where is CUSTOMER SERVICE?. I have been reporting an issue for MONTHS and I have not been assisted. My account was hacked, and it messed up a lot within my account: I cannot update my bio, I cannot change my profile photo, I am unable to change any sort of personal information such as my cellphone number, I do not receive ANY notifications, not even on my personal activity feed, so I dont even know when I get a like or comment. Its very frustrating, and I want help fixing it so I can enjoy this app to its capabilities and fullest extent. Please, someone get back to me. I have reported a problem countless times, filled out a hacking form, googled troubleshooting tips but nothing has worked"
"Consumer. Instagram is awesome. GooGooProof is a Seattle based childproofing service. Passing information along to parents, grandparents and child care providers with pictures and videos is such a great way to pass relevant information to huge numbers of people"
Someone hacked me. Someone hacked  my account and this new update stinks bro..I havent been on my account at night at all Also it say I have been on a service thats gives me likes and followers when I havent been on any of those websites
"Most horrible service/help ever. Id rate even lower if I could. I forgot my password and dont have access to my old email/the email I used to create my Instagram account. Its been over 5 years since Ive even made my email and I rarely log in. I dont know its password. Thus, I tried to switch my Instagram with a new email and new password. Worst. idea. ever. I didnt even know we would have the email switch confirmed with the old account, but now Ive lost access to my account overall. Ive switched the password but its still insistent I confirm a code sent to my prior email. Ive tried another way several times: by sending a video of myself to Instagram to confirm my identity. I know I have SEVERAL pictures of myself on my account, even my profile picture is of me. But not only did they reject it the first time, when I sent a second one, they emailed me saying they couldnt confirm it literally ONE minute after I sent the video. Its like they didnt even try to confirm it was me. Im just so upset by this because I have so many memories on that account, its been 3+ years after all, and now Instagram is saying theres nothing they could even do and they cant confirm its me. SO DISAPPOINTING"
"BUG: MISSING ACCOUNT, asked to enter 6-digit code (security page is blank)). September 15th, 2021  I opened Instagram and immediately got a screen saying that due to suspicious activity, I needed to enter a 6-digit code sent to my phone number. I received the code, but the security page appeared blank (I tried on both mobile and computer). I have tried viewing my logged-out account from my other account, and the search bar says that account no longer exists. This seems to be a common bug that just randomly deleted a bunch of peoples accounts. My missing accounts username is starwbebrry. Instagram, please fix this bug ASAP before all of our accounts data gets permanently deleted"
"Find me. Track, your cheating spouse cellphone activities without having access to the phone.

"No music option in stories. Hey Instagram Please give me back the option to put music in my stories That was one of my most-used and favorite features. It disappeared about a month and a half ago, and has yet to come back. It works fine on my personal account, but not on my business/bookish one. Makes me very sad. "
"The worst app in privacy & free speech in same time keep hate speech & spam. The worst app in privacy , Fighting free speech with facts &amp; court sentences in same time keep hate speech &amp; spam online"
Easily the app app ever. My most used. Most enjoyed. A way of connecting to likeminded peeps in both my personal &amp; professional life. Would say Im addicted but Ive got control. Its my reward and my downtime. Love love love this app 
Button disappeared. iPhone XR Instagram issue. So Ive had the suggested for you button gone from my personal Instagram page - its annoying because I use that to find new businesses to connect with However it still remains there for my inactive personal account...Any help?
terrible. to many porn spam accounts and my messages dont even pop up unless i open my app another issue i been seeing fake accounts of my personal friends and that pisses me off should never be happening please fix this issue
So amazing download it now. Its fun you can do voice overs you can post you can make your account private or public you should download it
"Music sticker has been removed. For some reason, Instagram has taken away my music sticker and I cannot find a way to get it back. I have logged out of all of my accounts, changed them from business accounts to personal accounts and back, deleted the app and reinstalled, still no sign of the music sticker. Really disappointed with this"
"horrible story upload quality. I have an 13pro, and great wifi and data connection, but whenever i post on my story the quality becomes horrible"
Its bugging. My instagram wont play my videos but i can hear them and i when i scroll they keep playing but none of my videos play at all. Rather im in wifi or using my own data
Hacked. My account got hacked and it changed my password to something different. Dont download for risk of your privacy
Not working. My account continues to tell me that I am running a promotion &amp; I cant switch to a personal account until I stop running the promotion but I go to promotions &amp; it says I HAVE NO past or present promotions Why is this app being so crazy and no matter what I do I cant seem to get Instagram to help me fix this. Its been months. This is effecting the business that Im trying to run Most annoying thing ever
Customer support. Ive generally enjoyed all my years on this app. Ive loved having a place to put all my emptied and make a digital scrapbook. But my biggest frustration by far has been with a lack of support. My account was hacked last night and the hacker immediately changed the email and phone number on the account. There was no option to revert these changes in the emails I was sent that said these changes were made. The absolute only option I was given was to submit a video selfie  I did several and non of them were able to confirm my identity. I now am not even able to get to that step. I put my username in and hit the forgot password option and it says an error occurred. Years of memory have been stolen from a hacker in Nigeria. Thanks Instagram for all your help Im not getting this resolved
"instagram login. everytime i try and login to my account after i receive a code to get back in because i have forgotten my password it says unable to connect to the internet. i have tried uninstalling the app, reconnecting to wifi, using my data, and restarting my phone. i cant even set up a new account either. not that i would want to but i have tried"
"Help. Insta is honestly amazing, but I was on my puppys page and tried to go to my personal. It said it couldnt logo me in Ive been trying by to get in since Any suggestions??"
Super fun app. I really enjoy this app for my business and personal sharing
"Quality of story, pictures,. When i upload a story or a picure its alsways very bad quality (the option save mobile data is off) does somebody has a solution?"
"shopping center and personal account glitch. hi instagram, i have two complaints. one being the frustration i have going to click on my notification tab that i have been used to clicking on for 7 or more years and seeing a shopping center that i will never use. and then having to go back to my home page and clicking on a small little heart icon to find my notifications. please switch it back; no one likes it. two, i have a glitch with my personal page. many of my followers have reached out to me asking if i have blocked them. i have not recently blocked anyone. ive received screenshots of my page from them, and it does look like i have blocked them. my follower count has not gone down so on my end, they are still seen as following me but on their ends, it looks like i have blocked them. i filed a report on instagram with screenshots of what my page looks like from their end but i am still waiting on a reply. i have updated it to the recent version and still, nothing has improved. ive always enjoyed this app but recently, ive had some disappointing experiences"
Why?. Why have you added Reels to everyones explore page? I keep selecting the Not Interested option on pages and videos that i dont want to see but they keep showing up. Im bored of this app now. Youve ruined it by forcing non interesting content onto personal feeds. Disappointing
"Help me please. Hi so my username on instagram currently is kevin.andrewsss and my username use to be kevin42boy well someone took after I changed it and posted a picture saying listen to my music and they were pretending to be me. They have been inactive for 2 years now can I please have my kevin42boy username back, if you check my account and my username changes it will show I had it at one point"
Account hacked. My account was hacked both of them and randomly logged me out. First every time I posted an image or deleted one it would say my action is blocked. Then wouldnt let me post or delete anythingThen it changed my icon to a different photo the original photo I had. And then the account disappeared off my phone infront of my eyes. Then when asked to sign back in it doesnt work stating account not found. Just opened this account for my business. Not happy. This has happened three times and the password is not the issue.Recovery code doesnt get sent to phone number its been hours now still not working.hoping you can figure out whos doing it because they keep bothering us n other people Im sure other companies
"Notification Spam. If you have multiple accounts, you will be spammed with notifications that have nothing on them. Every day I wake up with several on both accounts for personal life and art, that can not actually be seen. So if youre the person who hates the red dot, this new update will upset you"
"Reels feature not working. My client @iamearthkind reels feature stopped working months ago. Reels wont share to their main feed and can only be accessed via the use audio feature on the first reel they were able to share - which they were able to post when the feature was available for 1 week before it disappeared. Its incredibly frustrating and affecting our social strategy and the accounts performance. Ive reported it daily for weeks and nothing, have also tried reinstalling, clearing cache, signing up for beta, contact Instagram employees but still nothing. Such a shame when small businesses invest so much into the app and ads to then receive nothing back, and cant even contact a customer service personal to assist? The social team before us had the same issue and werent able to fix it either"
"Thank you. . Had an account for some time, but just recently started using it. Greatly appreciate the incredible vistas and content shared here from so many wonderful people around the world. "
"terrible update. The new update is just awful, it is hard to use and just completely unnecessary. Plus the new update happening today raises huge privacy concerns"
"dms not working. About two days ago, my instagram stopped displaying new messages from group chats or personal chats in the Instagram app. All my chats are gone from the main DM screen, I have to add them back manually using the search bar. I still receive notifications from IG on my phone when someone messages me, but they do not show up in the app. I can still send messages to other people, and they still receive them. I have tried everything from logging out and logging back in, to installing the latest iOS update on my phone, in an effort to restore functionality to Instagram Direct"
Let users pay for an ad free version. Let users mute reels from the explorer pageStop selling our data
"my account was deleted for using an analytics app. im putting this here in hopes that someone at ig will see it, since their help desk is useless and theyre no longer providing human help. i was using one of those analytics apps that tracks the number of people that unfollowed you when i was suddenly logged out and refused entry. i tried creating a new account with the same username and email, but it says they were already taken. i stupidly removed my email from the account, but now i think that means i dont have a way of getting back in. i have the username, phone number, and password still, and i can provide verification of identity. the poor help and random deactivation of my account does not look good, guys"
"no. First off,  most of the time the video im watching randomly stops and i have to scroll to the next post and back to make it play all the way. Secondly, our privacy is going to be violated according to the new terms and services, disgusting honestly"
Im the spy in America. Good
Cant add music to story. Several updates later and I still cant add music to my stories. I dont understand why my account is unable to use this feature. My others accounts have it. Just not my personal. Weird AND annoying
What is happening. Fix your app. I left it for 3 weeks for some personal issues and I come back and I cant see any messages. I can do everything else but I cant see or start messages I dont know whats happening. I cant talk to my friends now. I either need a solution or an update or something. Before this it was pretty fine
"Still cant add music to my posts. Biggest complaint I have is their refusal to add the music option to my page. Every other business and personal account I know can add music to their posts in their stories I have been begging IG for months to allow me to do the same, for some reason they have restricted my account or something because I still cannot add any music to my posts. This is truly inconvenient I am a small business and my competitors can jazz up their posts and videos all the while here I am begging IG to allow me to do the same"
Private Messaging. Looks like some countries are able to select a specific message in a chat conversation and reply to that message only. I cant seem to have this option available
"I cant log back into my account. Dont get me wrong its a good app and super safe with hacking, but I logged into my friends phone and it would not let me log back into it on my phone because they didnt know if it was me I tried millions of ways to try to get back into. I do not have the same number anymore so I cannot access it nor the phone it dumb they declined my face scan multiple time even tho it was me "
wack. ahmmm- hey just wanted to say ur app is wack its very laggy and and i cant spam comments on my friend post cuz i wanted to hype her comments section but u aint letting so pls fix it
"STILL DONT HAVE REELS - AUS 2021. Instagram can you pleaseee fix this bug. It is over a year after instagram reels have been introduced and I still dont have reels on my personal account. However, my business apps on the same app do I have messaged support over 15 times over the past year and received no response Please fix it"
"Instagram DMs not working/showing. The direct messages are not showing and are stuck on the loading circle screen. Where I can not see, open, read or send any messages. This issue is only happening to 2 of multiple accounts that Iam sign into on my iPhone XS. Please help fix this issue. I have try uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache, try using mobile data, disconnected/reconnected wifi, turn phone off/on, restarted phone, updated the app, etc but nothing has fix this. Thank you"
"Terrible experience. They are oligarchs who shadowban, and try to affect the personal freedoms we once experienced, in an attempt to mold our usage around their propaganda-esque algorithm. I wouldnt let your children use this app"
PLEASE RESOLVE THIS IMMEDIATELY. I have been using IG for a couple years and I use this for personal use only. Im not even that active .. I only check once or twice a week Ans I only follow around 200 accounts. Its been about 5 days that I CANNOT like any posts or follow any account. What is up with that?????? Please RESOLVE this issue immediately. I have not done anything wrong. Im very annoyed
"App not working using my mobile data lately. The app itself is amazing but lately I have been experiencing a weird thing. When I open app, it shows using mobile data, it shows no interbet connection. Works fine with wifi.I have tried reinstalling, updating app several times and also cleared the search data within the app. But still the same.Also, there must be an option to edit our comment. Its a very common thing to have in an app"
"Music. OMG what has happened to music in stories and reels??? All of a sudden, its no longer available. Ive tried re-installing Instagram, changing my profile from business to personal and back to personal and still nothing. Soo frustrating. Please fix this ASAP"

"Cant share other accounts post. Just bought iPhone 11 but I cant share/add other accounts posts to my story, but i logged in to other personal accounts as well and they can share normal"
"Unreliable Account Access. I cannot access my account after taking a few months off from it. Contacting customer support is not an option as you are always directed to the help center which is extremely unhelpful. There is a facade that all your data is within your control, but no actual evidence to back up those claims when troubleshooting is so poor. Then when you try to leave a negative review all the nicknames are strangely taken"
Post dimensions. Love the app for info and inspiration. The main issue is the dimensions required for posts that cuts off many pictures
Great App. I enjoy using this app to express myself and to stay in contact with old friends and stay connected both on a personal and professional level
"Crashing and losing everything. So I just updated it on my phone, go to open it and everything was gone, I use my page for my bissness, and one for my personal, both pages all my posts and follows gone, I know I didnt go against any community standards or anything, it was working for me an hour ago.... definitely not cool"

No music in stories. Hey instagram. I have a personal account and used to be able to put music on my stories but now am unable to. I have tried logging out and uninstalling the app with no luck. Help me please 
Cant access account. Someone hacked my account and changed the phone number.  And yall are doing nothing about this is complete bs
"I expect a response. I have been trying to make a new Instagram account for a long time. I have a personal account, and now Im trying to make a separate account to be a business account. I do NOT want to change my personal to a business, I want a SEPARATE business account. For some reason, Im unable to make a new account. It keeps telling me everything is fine, until I go to sign up at the end. When I get to that part, it tells me Error. I want a new account but I cant make one. What is yalls problem? Im expecting a response to this because I want to know what yall screwed up on and how you plan to fix it"
Unable to share posts to story. Im not able to share posts to my story from my own feed or other public pages. Ive tried every troubleshooting option and it works for my personal account but not my professional account
". I (&amp; many others) am over this apps algorithm, lack of linear timeline (why am I seeing two week old posts at the top of my feed??), &amp; the fact that it has shoved shopping in my face. I came here years ago to just share from my personal life &amp; to see what others have shared &amp; now I cant scroll far without seeing suggested posts. If I wanted to see posts I dont follow, I probably wouldve followed by now. All I want is a linear timeline with less shopping buttons "
NOTIFICATIONS. Since Ive downloaded the app on my iPhone 12 Max Pro my notifications are not pushing to my device. 
"Settings. For the past week Ive been deleting messages out of my inbox, and everyday that I get a new message they all reappear. Im getting notifications when I log into the app that I have multiple messages, however, Ive turned all my notifications off so that Im not receiving direct messages or any other messages. Yet, here I am. At this point Im not enjoying the app because I cant even get my privacy level where I would like it to be"

"Hacked. I was hacked on Sunday by someone in Nigeria using a friends  account to hack me. This person in the US, a young Mom paid a Nigerian to promote her Bitcoin  business. Unless all of it was a hoax. Nonetheless, I read their private message on my account when I finally got it back and she was thanking him. IG uses a new facial recognition to compare your account. It took almost 3 days but thats faster than some of the horror stories on YouTube. As I was trying to change my phone number he must have been getting alerts through sms because he kept changing it back to the Nigerian number. I finally secured it- I pray  I visualized and prayed to my Guardian Angels and guides last night and at 4am I noticed IG had secured my Account Thank you"

"PLEASE FIX DIRECT SHARE TO STORY FUNCTION. So the bug thats been plaguing peoples accounts with no fix since appearing in early 2018 finally happened to me. Instagrams function to share posts (my own as well as others) directly to my story via the airplane icon has ceased to function on my main account but is still working on my secondary. Seeing as there is no apparent fix (privacy settings are set to public, reinstalled several times several ways, no its not appeared at the bottom now) its genuinely just vanished.. Surely its time now for this long standing bug to be patched..? Please put this right"
"Broken & Zero Customer Support. The feature to upload multiple images/videos to a post has been gone from both my personal and professional accounts for over a week. Ive logged two reports of issues and reached out on social media to complete silence. Ive rebooted my phone, reinstalled the app and tried from a browser all to no avail. Ive checked with others and the issue seems to be intermittent but not limited to just me. As a result, Ive stopped posting to my personal account"
"Blah. Too many fake, sexual, fake marketing profiles following both my personal and business pages,Really throws a wrench in my progress for both pages. Please fix it. Getting ridiculous. Tired of getting asked if I want to bang or flirt with robots"
Step it up and chillOut. Chill out a d get your algorithms and software working and not just spying
Awesome app. This is a great app for personal and business users
"Direct messages not loading. About two days ago, my instagram stopped displaying new messages from group chats or personal chats in the Instagram app. All my chats are gone from the main DM screen, I have to add them back manually using the search bar. I still receive notifications from IG on my phone when someone messages me, but they do not show up in the app. I can still send messages to other people, and they still receive them. I have tried everything from logging out and logging back in, to installing the latest iOS update on my phone, in an effort to restore functionality to Instagram Direct"
HORRIBLE - TRACKS YOU. THIS APP WILL LISTEN TO AND RECORD EVERYTHING YOU SAY AND DO WHILE ITS INSTALLED
"Really annoying haptic feedback. I like using Instagram but now they have added haptic feedback to the action of liking photos in the main feed. This is unbelievably annoying, having my phone vibrate every time I like something, I like a lot of things because I follow account which post photos I enjoy seeing Ive had to turn haptic feedback off for for the entire iPhone because there is no way to do this per app which is very frustrating as I think its useful. I think in this case the app makers are not being true to the idea behind haptic feedback and apples guidelines i.e. it should be used judiciously"
"Updates only getting worse. New update is confirmation to how little this app cares about its users. It uses cheap tricks to promote shopping from unreliable third parties through the app, with obvious goals to collect more data about users while uplifting advertisers. They need to fix this"
No iPad version. No iPad version and you continue to get a one star from me until you change that.Ill continue to login through safari so you continue to get no data from me. Lol no data no problem
Unable to share posts to story. I dont have the share post to story option on my instagram account. I run multiple accounts and some has this feature while my personal Instagram does not. I tried deleting and re-downloading the app and that still hasnt helped. Please help me fix this
"Cant find the + sign. I run a football team Instagram account and I cant find the + sign on the bottom of the screen, but on my personal account its there where has it gone??"
Updates not consistent across all profiles. I still do not have reels on my business account which is very frustrating but I have it on my personal account - I wish the updates were consistent
I hate the update. Why can I not have my business linked amd my personal .... irritated
Terrible performance with iPhone 11. Never had an issue with this app until I updated my phone to an iPhone 11 Pro. Notifications dont work at all regardless of your settings. App refuses to log out of account(s). Figure it out Facebook
Low Data Mode is just useless. Why videos auto-play in low data mode is something I would never understand
"Account Process. Im trying to make a new account. All my information is correct and appropriate. Yet when I finish all the info it says,Sorry, there was a problem with your request. Sometimes it says, There was a problem registering your account, please check your internet connection. I clearly have internet as I am typing this review. Please address this issue"
"Unable to log into my account since 2020. I have had my Instagram account since June 2015. Last time I had access to that account was January 2020. Sometime in February 2020, I mysteriously lost access to my account. My password wouldnt work, and every time I tried to reset it, I never receive a reset email. From that time up until now, Ive not had access to that account. My email and username are correct but I cannot access the account. When I google my username or search using another Instagram account, I see that my account is still available/active. I have made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Instagram about this issue. If I cannot get access to my account, they should at least delete my account information given that my personal information is out in the open. This is very unfair. Thank you"
:/. it logged me out and wont let me sign in anymore  i lost my personal account with my information:/ i dont get any messages or email to get my account back:(
"Too bad to use it. Be careful what you are using. This application is a spy and very bad behavior staff, they are agents of *****"
"No customer service cause they dont care. My account got hacked and deactivated I had to go through customer service and nothing works there are no representative to talk to as well as none of the support links provide helpful information, Im very disappointed on how they just dont verify anything before deactivating the account and clearly the log info says the account was logged into from different country"
"bro my music is gone :(. cddn1629 on instagram LSJOSBDKD GOTTA PLUG SRY no um, im acc extremely upset because i switched froma business account to a personal account  and my music is still gone whats up with that"
Page being hacked. We need a easier way to get false and fraudulent people from using our information and soliciting our contact. Please help me in my situation. Thanks
Fake profiles. Too many models trying to sign you up for their own personal website
"Got hacked. I liked the app, but the amount of spam messages you get from fake accounts is annoying If you even look at a link they send you, you get hacked Would never download again"
GIVE ME MY ACCOUNT BACK PLEASE. You guys disabled my account and i emailed you guys 4 -5 times about a miss communication. I need my account back ive had that account for 2-3 years and it means alot . I have personal stuf on my account . Please give my account back @hoezluvalaya
"Lauren.danceee. Not happy with my posts not showing but to only very very few of my followers given how much time and hard work I spend on my account.My posts used to show and as a result were liked by thousands allowing me to grow, now it is just no possible to grow like that and it is obvious that my posts are barely visible to my followers. It is hurtful and frustrating (makes me not want to use the app, makes me not want to purchase from vendors), given that I have participated in paid ads, and I purchase from your advertising (a good customer) and yet you have hampered my personal growth despite my hard daily work.You obviously do not recognize how hard and expend it is to work in context for it to be controlled by you so much that my followers dont see it"
New update idea. Ok so I have a idea for the upcoming update. On the explore page we should be able to like the recommendation pictures on the explore page if we enjoy the pictures inside of the front ones. This is so your explore page could be more personal. Idk but hope you take this into consideration with the team :)
"Music feature broken. Dear Instagram,I understand that you are trying to protect artist with copyrighted music but heres the thing. There is this thing called Fair use and I switched to a personal account and it still is showing these artist Ive never heard of. Please fix thisI enjoy putting music on my story"
"Refuses to take down doxxing. My ex roommate doxxed me on instagram and although ive reported it and then asked instagram to re look at it, they have decided there is nothing wrong with the post I have asked this ex roommate to take down his post and he refused and instagram wont do anything because they dont have an option to explain hey ive been doxxed, my private information like where i live has been released "
Wont work. App will not work on cellular data
This is BA. Im am constantly having the issue where I have to enable camera and microphone access. Ive turned my phone on and off. Deleted and redownloaded the app and it still isnt working
Basically a shopping app now?. I know you guys are all about selling data but the lastest interface is just so schilled out it&#39;s not even funny. Why would we want to have a bottom menu for shopping? This isn&#39;t Amazon. I miss the ability to check on notifications. This is terrible
locked out of my accounts. it was refusing to let me back into my account without a code it was sending to my old phone number i got a new phone number . FINALLY i got someone to help me get back into my main (first) account. BUT my other 2 linked accounts are gone now they are no longer linked so i can not access my other personal account (my new one i use now) OR my photography/business instagram  please help me im loosing business this is ridiculous it shouldnt be this difficult. i got a reply a while ago saying to send another pic to prove its me i did now i cant get a response . i really dont understand if they were all linked why are they not linked to my main account now ?????
"Story video. Having issues with a longer story video for my business page vs my personal page, only does 15 seconds and one does 1 minute? Help?"
Account info category bug. For account information it wont let me change the category. I want the category hidden but it says Actor and I want it to be hidden
Unable to share to facebook. I have a personal account and a creator account. I used to be able to share posts from both accounts on my personal profile page and now you are unable to do this at all with the creator account. No way of linking it to a personal Facebook. Why? This is absolutely ridiculous - I use 2 account to have different post but I like to share to my Facebook for my family who dont have Instagram to see I am so annoyed its unbelievable
"Cant edit my profile?. I do love Instagram, but why the heck cant I edit my profile? Any time I hit the edit profile button, it just loads, then it will say were sorry, something went wrong, please try again later Ive tried on WiFi, Ive tried on cellular data, Ive tried on Instagram using safari, Ive tried deleting the app and redownloading. I dont get what the issue is"
Disable auto videos. Can we please get a update where its possible to turn off auto video It uses up way too much data
"WTF. HATE HATE HATE this new update... what on Earth were you thinking? Why would we ever want to see a shopping tab over our personal notifications? Pls change it back, this is awful"
Congratulations. Youve ruined your product. Used to be great. Now there are so many ads and other content on my personal page that it has become near useless for me
Instagram app is buggy. There are two main issues that keep repeating with the app.One issue is happens when I dont log out of an account. When I tap the app icon again the app logs me out and takes me to the screen where the account login buttons are at. The app stops responding at that point. If tap an account to login Instagram does not respond. The app is frozen at that point.Another issue is that every once while the app wont let me login to my personal account. The app will allow me to login to the other accounts I have created. But if I try to login to my personal account the app gives me an error message. Sometimes the app will not allow me to login to my personal account for 1 or 2 days.This is very frustrating
Spy Program. Its a spy program
Likes. I am not happy that on my other personal account I can no longer see likes of others when on this account i can this is very unfair
"Make chat themes personal to each person. My friends and I do agree on what theme to make our chat, so it would be sick if we could all have our own"
Editing. Please allow us to delete or edit pictures from a post that has multiples. I posted a post with multiple pictures and one of the pictures has my licenses plate in it. And I just want to delete that picture for safety and privacy reasons but cant I have to delete the entire post
THE UPDATE IS SO BAD. CHANGE IT BACK I HATE THIS SO MUCH. and this whole forward a picture? that invades our privacy to the max. you literally DESTROYED the app. change it back to normal please my god
"poor customer service. mikaelslittleworld is my sons account who is 2.6 years old so basically i manage his account and i got two factor authentication on it and unfortunately while changing my phone i mistakenly erased the data on previous phone before selling it and when i tried to log into my new phone it asks for codes. As i selected the authenticator app option and now i don&#39;t have a backup for that app i cant get the codes although my phone number is still the same and my email too.I received one email from instagram saying two factor authentication is removed for my account but my problem is still not solved as i cant log in, it is still asking for codes.My backup codes are not working. I have sent the proofs that it is my account but still no response after that single reply.I dont know who i should contact to get it sorted although it is really not a big issue if the team can help. Its been a month now, i need my account back but there is no response. It is so disappointing staying with the instagram for years, doing such a hardwork to reach a number of followers and now they are not even replying me back to help me.No contact from instagram after that email"
"I hate the new update. I frequently use 3 separate Instagram accounts daily, for my personal use, professional and business use. All 3 accounts have been updated by Instagram differently. Only one account has the normal explore page and notification tab. The other two accounts have changed from the notification tab to a shopping tab. I am never going to use that And I have to go back and forth and to every single tab to find my notifications. My notification tab is in a different place on all 3 accounts. Theres no way to adjust this or revert this automatic update. It is not a cohesive design at all. It is very frustrating and hard to use. I despise of this update and it is making me want to quit using Instagram all together if this change is not reverted to its original layout"
Hacked account. They hacked my previous account  And are bribing me to pay them $100 back for it  I tried to reach out to you guys and get no helpful Information

"Help Centre Broken - Fix this please. I got deactivated for merely unfollowing too many people, I got no warning or explanation (this was my first so called community guideline violation) Ive used all the help prompts and sent my personal information etc (which is very intrusive may I add) and heard nothing Not even a courtesy message to acknowledge my help request or give me some kind of timeframe, the help system is broken and a disgrace - Ill change my feedback once this is fixed "
"I got hacked. My other account got hacked by someone who was a scammer who claimed that he would send me $1,000 for Christmas through PayPal. He ended up changing my email and password on Instagram and Facebook accounts and I am not able to get back on because his information is on my account and he refuses to let me change it"
"this is a scam. look my music isnt working for some reason its a bit frustrating because it adds spice to my stories and it says i have copyright ? but i dont understand how, i know multiple ppl who have this problem i redownloaded the app multiple times and still no results hm anyways i changed my account back to my personal account and still no luck"
"Glitch on personal Account. On my personal account, theres always glitches. Right now, the Share to my story option is missing, and has been for about a week now. Which is very inconvenient. Ive reported it multiple times and still nothing. Back when this first rolled out I didnt have for monthsI have a second account as well... so i can see that its clearly still an option. I need this fixed, asap. Also, the way likes after being seen are organized are completely different on the 2 accounts. Not quite as big of a problem, just more annoying than anything"
Im dissapointed. You guys disabled my personal account for no reason
Merge Name Change. My merge has now outed my last name by drawing information from my private Facebook profile. So disappointed
"My dms . About two days ago, my instagram stopped displaying new messages from group chats or personal chats in the Instagram app. All my chats are gone from the main DM screen, I have to add them back manually using the search bar.

"Improvements. I would like it if the sound wasnt automatically on every time I enter the app and was off like I always have it before I exit the app. Yall should let us post stuff at whatever size we want or at least make the frame a couple inches bigger because zooming out pictures for a full size still isnt enough. You guys should let us turn off notifications in-app. I already turned off the notifications for my phone, but Im getting annoyed with some people who like to go live a lot in one day and constantly having to see notifications for them popping up. I dont wanna unfollow them since I like their content, but ugghhh. Yall should remove the See More Posts Like This tab, too because thats annoying to see every time I click on a post on the Explore feed"
"Not displaying option to add to story on anything. No matter what we do (and weve scoured the internet for guidance), we cannot get the Add this to your story option to display for anything when logged into our work account. It does display on all of our personal accounts. Weve submitted help tickets but have yet to hear anything back"
Useless Notifications. Too much spam mixed in with notifications I actually want. Notification settings are too confusing. I cant find the option to disable notifications about x added to their story
"Worst app ever created. This app was once an exceptional social media platform however once it was bought out by assbook they lost all their credibility. They spy on you, take up too much space, use excessive battery. They are now constantly changing their platform and pushing users and their content out and turning it into a forced online store. They have ruined their own platform through greed, lies, political, financial, and propagandists interests. I hear they hate children at this place. They favour lies, deception, and destruction over health, honesty, peace, and integrity"
"I cannot share posts to my story. I dont know why I am the only one that cannot share a post to my story. It drives me nuts. I do exactly the same thing as mi amigos, I have the app updated and privacy settings the same as theirs and it just doesnt give me the option to send post to my story. Its bunk"
Awful update. Not even deserving a single star. Youre really trying to run your users off the app with the way youre blocking popular music from business accounts. Even if people switch to personal its still only offers terrible royalty free music that nobody wants to use or listen to. Now we cant even recommend each other music that may be more underground than what people normally listen to
Horrible. My account got disabled without me violating the T&Cs. There is no explanation and my account just disappeared. I am no influences only have my personal account for me and my friends and family and it got taken away from me for no reason How is this possible? Also you are unable to contact them just through forms where theres no actual response just the jargon.. horrible service.. watch out
"why is my ig dumb. for my personal account, the music button is not an option and yes it says that my app is updated there are also other things missing and its upsetting"
"Dont like it. I dont have the new fonts and I have updated the application, I deleted it and nothing.  Actually, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a problem with the application or it&#39;s my personal account, but I don&#39;t even like to use instagram for the same reason"
"Temporarily locked out of my account. Hello, In the past Instagram has been so efficient helping people get back into their account. I was hacked and changed my password right after. A week later i received a notification saying I am temporarily locked out of my account due to phishing activity. That was on 1/12. I am still locked out and have reached out more than 7 times. There has to be a way another than email verification (not everyone has access to their old email accounts)"
"Glitches. I love using the app for my personal account and my business. But it doesnt let me play music on my business account or like messages in my DMs as well as my personal. It did before, and my friends can. Its very annoying, if some one can fix that"
"Music sticker for stories not working. I post pictures on my story fairly frequently, but I went to post something and some weird music that Ive never heard of or seen before shows up and none of the trending songs are there either. My account is small and theres no way I couldve done anything to get my regular music taken away. I just recently switched to a business account to see insights but now I switched back to personal but the music option still isnt there. I submitted a report for the issue but Im not sure how long it will take until its fixed"

"Instagram shut down my account for my small business after impersonation accounts were made. Hello,My name is Rachel Engen - I am the owner of the account @_engenessentials (my small business) as well as my personal instagram account @_rachelengen - and I have had trouble over the past 48 hours with many FAKE accounts being made that are similar to my name such as -@engenesstial@_engenessentiials @_engenessentials_@_engenessentiialssThey have been messaging my followers who entered my giveaway in attempt to steal their credit card informationI have reported these accounts and have had my followers do the same - but now my account has been shut down today in the process and I am heartbroken and at a loss of what to do. I am very shaken up about this - as this is my small business and how I provide income for my family - my husband, daughter, and I, and I am expecting baby #2.Having my account frozen and taken down like this is very scary, and I am not sure how and why this can happen so easily.All of your help would be MUCH MUCH appreciated- Rachel"
Not updated. All these lovely updates and I dont see the changes. First- I got the font change in stories but they stuck my tool bar on the left side of the screen where Im constantly touching and activating the icons by accident when I enlarge a picture. Horrible. Its like that in my personal account too. But its on top like it used to be in a third account Second- Why cant I send a video post from my page and have the video function? Other people I know can do it. Mine just lands I. Stories dead.  I cant do it on any of my accounts. Thats been updated for a while. WHY are these rolled out to some and others never see them? Why is that a thing??? Instagram youre on my last nerve today. A measly two stars for you and a smack on the head. DO BETTER
Account hacked and removed infront of my eyes. My account was hacked both of them and randomly logged me out infront of my eyes on my phone. Your careless company doesnt do jack about any of the support tickets Ive sent. So ironic you buy a company for money but cut everything else? First every time I posted an image or deleted one it would say my action is blocked. Then my account wouldnt let me post or delete anythingThen it changed my icon to a different photo the original photo I had. And then the account disappeared off my phone infront of my eyes. Then when asked to sign back in it doesnt work stating account not found. Just opened this account for my business. Not happy. This has happened three times and the password is not the issue.Recovery code doesnt get sent to phone number its been hours now still not working.hoping you can figure out whos doing it because they keep bothering us n other people Im sure other companies
"New Update is terrible. I have no clue why all of these changes were done. They are going full myspace now and putting tons of extra steps into everything. Its not as intuitive as it used to be. Making things way more complicated than they need to be. Additionally, I now get a ton of pesky notifications that dont make any sense and wont clear off my phone. I have to restart the phone to get rid of the notifications. Please fix this update????"
No notifications on messages. I love Instagram and I use it on a daily. Instagram had multiple of updates and I had one issue and thats not getting the notifications when someone messages me. I had this issue for over a year. I have all my notifications on to be notified but never be notified. I do get the notifications when someone likes or comments my pictures but not the messages. Even though I use it daily I dont check messages daily but now has been an additional step to check because I never know when I have new messages. Please fix this issue

"I cannot add music to my reel post. Ive updated to the latest version and tried to switch my account to personal, business or creators. However Instagram didnt allow me to add any music to my reel"
No music. I have 2 accounts - one for personal and one creator account. 6 months ago the music sticker vanished from my creator account. With reels now being a new thing I wanted to create one however it said that music wasnt available for my account. I have enjoyed using the music sticker for a long time and it just vanished. It has affected the content I create and Instagram hasnt been any help despite me reporting the problem on multiple occasions. I can still use the music sticker on my personal account therefore Im at a loss as to why it is no longer available on my creator account
Personal account doesnt work. Havent been able to access my personal account since May 31. Contacted support multiple times and tried all the suggested fixes and no luck on any devices or network. Wont even load
"Where tf yall went wrong. Yall started verifying just anybody and they momma, that verification check get to some many peoples heads, its just not about removing likes that is the problem. Like that dude @masonrayparker, Im after his head, all he do is spam who else is high af rn and is verified, so how somebody that spam on a day to day basis still got that account.. oh wait its because yall dont look into private accounts which is why they get away with getting reported, step it tf up"
WiFi unavailable. It has been working on WiFi and after update will no longer work on WiFi only on cellular data
"Suggested Posts & Reels Updates are TRASH. Look at all these 5 star paid fake reviews to keep the rating up....everyone hates the new update so gotta do damage control huh IG????You have made the WORST decision of all time. Now my homefeed is nothing but Suggested Posts and ads. I thought it was just a few posts but scrolling down and further down its all now suggested posts and ads Why would you do this???? These suggested posts are no different than ads Whats the point of the explore feed now when you are shoving the same garbage down our throats on our personal homefeed???? And the Reels are pointless same garbage as before just in a bigger window. Wow, youre a        s t u p i d company.YOU ARE THE WORST COMPANY ON THE PLANET NOTHING BUT CANCERI will be unistalling this app Goodbye"

"Unable to access my personal grid. For days now, I have been unable to access my personal grid ... when I tap on the little person icon the screen goes black and nothing responds. I cant access my posts, setting or saved posts. Everything just goes black. Only way to re-access the app is to close completely and re-open. Even with the latest update this is still happening. FIX IT PLEASE. (iPhone SE 2020)"
"TOO MUCH. Ok now its gotten out of hand there is way to much on the new update. An incredible amount of buttons on the home screen its not even feeling like instagram anymore with the bombardment of things everywhere, cant even focus on the feed anymore. please stop adding so much and make it more simplified for simple users. also reels is not everyones cup of tea can you have an option to take it off"
"New update is very very slow bad and confuising. Hopefully these are just minor things but as for now its very slow, I dont load peoples pictures,  ( or info ) its hard to click though from peoples story posts, and why but why have you made it much harder to post stories? And no we dont like to shop on there"
"Never going to add my birthday. Trashy data mining. Thanks for letting us quit your app and restart, using insta for a few seconds before you prompt for birthday again. Super annoying"
Horrible customer service and help. Ive had my stuff hacked and have been trying to get in contact so that all my personal information or people wouldnt get hacked either. Ive been going through it for 2 days reaching out and trying to be helped so I can end this in general. In those 2 days no response from IG and no written emails to me no matter how much of my complaint has been sent. Ive done multiple trouble shooting and all I wanted was contact from a person there. So now multiple of my friends accounts have been hacked due to the lack of service this company gives Ive had it since 2012 and now I regret making tht decision since the ability to be hacked is so easy and they do nothing to help
Bug Issue with ios14. When receiving notification and clicking the banner it only opens instagram but doesnt take you to the related post/notification

This has lead to missing out on hundreds of dollars in donations, which directly impacts the animals that we rescue. This is not ok"
I got hacked agaaaain. Security of ur app is so low that ive been hacked 4 times in just 6 months. Just 10 days ago i lost the access to my account and today i lost it again and i cant get access to it anymore even though i had activated it to send me massage whenever someone tries to log in to my account and i received No massage smh
"Unwanted Email Notifications/Harrassment. Today I got an email notification addressing that I have been having trouble signing in to my account. I have no problem signing in and I know this one user who is harassing me by sending me multiple unwanted emails notifications. This user @sh1_2344 is abusing the Instagram login page forgotten password reset request button. In order to bully and harass me 4 months ago back in May or March spring season we both agreed to apologize and move on with ourselves with peace, because of an altercation that we had between each other. I thought that was resolved and I admitted that what I did was wrong and she forgave me. Right after that I confronted her if she knew who was sending me multiple emails and and text notifications she lied and told me that she didnt do it. During that time I noticed on that day she sent my mom 5 emails and text notifications. Right after that I she asked her friend to tell me that she will threaten to report me to her authorities before blocking me and she secretly blocked other accounts of mine and my moms account. Right after that the constant emails and text notifications had abruptly stopped. Just recently on Sep 2 she send me a email notification saying that I have trouble logging into my account and so I reset my password. I know that it was her, she had recently changed her profile picture and bio status twice being active with her account. She had been harassing me and my mom before by sending multiple emails and text notifications abusing the Instagram login password page. She wasnt being honest and blatantly lied to me and denied everything about sending me multiple emails and text notifications. So that she can confirm and block accounts that belonged to me and my family members accounts. Shes trying to hack my account please, have this user @sh1_2344 banned for harassment"
"NEEDS A CALL ICON. Im done with having to video call someone just to have a phone conversation, half the time Im not in the mood to be showing my face on camera so please put a call icon for a normal voice conversation"
Great pictures. A lot of information
"Request. My page being private, Im constantly told that people are submitting for me to accept them however I dont get a notification or, I get a notification and theres no request present."
"Pictures. Im a little annoyed that I can only post 1 picture at a time. What happened to being able to post multiple at a time? Is it just me, ever since I linked my personal account to my business account. Not even my personal account will allow posting multiple pictures"
"Music Library. Please fix the music library issue. Many people (including myself) had business accounts to view their insights (though, half of these features have been removed due to new EU privacy laws). When people switch back to personal or creator accounts, they still cannot access the original music library. Half of the features that people actually enjoyed using on this app have been removed due to copyright and privacy laws. Please make this app more compatible, or at least allow people with ex-business accounts to access the music library. Really frustrating"
Deleted my story. Deleted my story for personal problems
Glitches. It isnt allowing me to access my account through the app it keeps logging me off It is also glitching a lot (just this app not my phone)
Cant See Likes. Im not pleased with the no likes feature. Mostly everyone I talk to daily can still see likes from their profile but I cant see any from mine. I hope Instagram will change this feature back or at least give us the option as a privacy feature whether we want our likes to be viewed or not
Always fun. Great to see people from around the world important in these days of no personal connections
What do I do. I cant upload from my gallery to post on my story it just keep loading and never post... Ive tried deleting the app then reinstall it.. didnt work I tried logging in and out ....didnt work Ive even tried turning my data and wifi on and off didnt work . WHAT DO I DO ?
"No access to see messages. It&#39;s been almost a month now, not been able to use DM and stories sections, I tried log out log in, deleted, downloaded, tried everything as I can do It&#39;s pissing me off now -.-"
"Wow. I am a creator on Instagram and today the reels feature is no longer accessible the Ivón is completely missing from my account. Although its still on my personal, private account. Im really mad Fr who decided who can use these features and not. I didnt even get any violations or warning at all I have followed all guidelines. It is rediculous. If anybody knows how to fix this problem dm me on Instagram. @miahr0se"
Hacking does not matter to this app nor does threatening messages. Ive tried to delete one app Ive made. This app can be very dangerous due to the fact kids can get taken advantage of and so many other things Breaching and hack of this app has no security measurements. Yes app is funny fun but not very secure also if you are looking for a addition income loot for a private company well worth it
"Music does not work for my instagram. I love Instagram but I cannot use the music app in my stories, Ive tried and I dont have it. I did everything from reinstalling the app, making sure its up to date, Ive tried everything and I still dont get the music I even have it on my other Instagram but not on my personal one. Anyone else have this issue? Come on Instagram whats up with that "
Account disabled. Disabled my account for no reason. So many memories down the drain and cant download the data either
Hate the new set up. Thankfully my business account hasnt changed- hope it stays that way... but my personal account doesnt have an explore feature anymore. I dont want to just see reels and shopping all the time. Im really disappointed with the update
"Favorite App. Seeing is believing. Quick , easy and satisfying way to keep up with personal interests ~"
They messed up the algorithm again. I would give this zero stars if I could. Didnt think they could make it much worse but somehow they did I just saw two posts from someone in a row: one from today and then one from over two weeks ago. They happen to be an influencer. Then I checked my friends page - I had missed two posts from them in the past week. I am on my phone all day every day as I work in social media so I rarely go more than an hour without checking my personal account. Up until now that had pretty much prevented IGs algorithm from hiding posts but now the timeline is pretty much useless. This is my first app review in 10 years of owning an iPhone. Thats how stupid this update is
Unable to change profile picture. As a user if this app its frustrating to know I cant hanged my profile picture every thing is great except that Ive been trying for weeks and Ive already sent out reports but no one has addressed my issue so since its difficult answer to my report I hope you can answer to my private review of your app
Garbage app. Wow I cant believe how displeased I am with this application as of recently. The new layout is confusing to navigate. The customer service is horrendous. Theyre silencing peoples freedom of speech and deactivating accounts for no reason. Selling our information to the highest bidder and calling it marketing. No core values or willingness to uphold the  peoples second amendment rights. This application is run by a bunch of fascists
New updated version. Hi i still havent gotten the new updated version that everyone has on my regular personal account When doing a reel i cant add pictures just videos or using the moving fonts etc. But its on my makeup page which i dont understand why i cant have the updated version on my other Ig please fix ASAP thank you
My original account disappeared. My original  account disappeared and I cannot seem to retrieve it it has a Lot of old personal pictures that I would love to have back
Highlights. I have 2 Instagram accounts and when I am logged in on my personal account and Im trying to view my highlights I cant see all of them? Which means Im now unable to edit previous ones. When I view my personal account from my other Instagram account I can view all of the highlights. Why am I unable to view and edit all of them when Im logged in? Please fix this issue its so frustrating and I have old highlights that I need to access and edit. Very disappointed with the update
"Cant use captions after recent update . My story videos are rotated, squished and distorted any time I post with captions added. Was working fine before... Ive deleted reinstalled the app, tried on my personal account and business account to no avail"
"Love photography again. I used to be a Flickr, 23hq.com fan, photography was my passion, but then everyone became a photographer. With IG though, photography is personal again Great app"
"Complete lack of account support. Ive been concerned my account has been hacked for nearly 24 hours at this point. Ive requested the SMS 1 time security code, after putting in my proper username and password. The SMS never came after multiple requests. Ive done the email response sent by support with a picture of the emailed code, my username and selfie holding these up on a piece of paper (per supports request, super odd). No one has responded, nothing is being done while my account is potentially being hacked. Ive always been such a fan of IG until this moment; truly nerve wracking and disappointing smh. Do betta Meta"
Disappointed. Severely disappointed in the new user agreement. Far too much intrusion into privacy
TRYING TO HAVE MY HACKED ACCOUNT DELETED TO NO AVAIL. Immediately remove my hacked account of @12_katy_2kocsis I have submitted hundreds of reports. This person now has access to my private information. This person is extorting me for money in exchange of my account. This person is committing personation. Where is your customer support team? That is MY ACCOUNT AND I WISH FOR IT TO BE DELETED. Get in touch with me immediately or simply delete the account
"Picture quality. I dont know if its just me, but when I post a picture my picture quality isnt as good as it was when it was taken. I have an IPhone XR so I know it isnt my phone. I wish it would be fixed"
New Update. Recently the IG App was updated and the layout of the features were changed. Now the shopping feature is has replaced where the heart used to be at the bottom of the screen. And if you want to respond to posts and comments its a three step process as opposed to one like it was before. This recent change is annoying as H*LL The Shopping Option should be where the heart is on the personal page and leave the heart where it was. This new feature is stupid and it makes responding to comments more complicated. I hope you change it back
No one ever gets back to me. I hve and IG account that was hacked  Someone is impersonating me and scamming my friends and family. Using my personal photos  Of me and my children Id like it if someone gets back to me that would be great
"BAD ACCOUNT COMPROMISED. I unfollowed afew people on my personal account and have had my business account compromised because of this, I have to change my password however every time I try it says my old password is wrong so I have to click forgot password and then I get sent a link that doesnt do anything just takes me back to the same ACCOUNT COMPROMISED message and I have done this about 100 times I have googled everything I have reported it to Instagram it has been a week now and I still am not able to access my account or any of my messages regarding orders and my customers must think I have let them down I am at my wits end please help me 7 days too long without my business"
"Notifications lag. For some reason when someone tries to follow me the notification comes up on my phone but when I go on the app the red dot isn&#39;t there on the heart when the request is still there, I know someone is not on my account since I have checked the log in dates and times and its very secured. I am very confused by this"
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. An app with millions of users yet cant seem to provide any customer service. My account was hacked and I solved the issue on my own by changing my password. It worked and I had no further issues, then instagram steps in a few days later and locks me out because of the suspicious activity. Now I cant get back in because the only way to regain control is to validate my email that I recently lost access to. They have no way to contact them other than a phone number that no one ever picks up. And the voicemail message basically says for most issues we cant help you. I would say they have the worst customer service ever but that would mean they provided any form of customer service at all which they didnt"
LOVE INSTAGRAM HATE THE APP. I have owned instagram for around four years now. I have never faced so many problems with the app. I have to re download it every time i want to use it before it freezes which lasts around 10-2.0 minutes. I use instagram to communicate and market my business. Along with just using it for my personal account. I love instagram but can you please fix my problem. When it freezes it freezes on the first page and i cant scroll or do anything
Liked it better before updated. Give me an option to turn off the suggested profiles. I want to be able to scroll back to see posts I already saw. I also should be allowed to turn off Reels. I dont want it to auto-play the videos. I dont have unlimited data I dont want to watch people dancing using my data
DANGEROUS. Not the best all you do is scroll through pictures and it can hack through your phone
"Images wont send?. I try sending literally any image at all, content: words, video, image of how long our phone call lasted, etc and the photos wont send. I cannot unsend them is the bad part. I tried uninstalling, switching from wifi to data, deleting chat, blocking and unblocking. NOTHING IS WORKING Make it so that you can unsend sending images"
"notification. generally I enjoy the app a good amount. but since the new update I have had a really annoying glitch that I can&#39;t figure out. I have a badge notification that pops up several times a day. there is nothing I have a notification on, and when I switch accounts to my business it says my personal account has a message. I don&#39;t have a message, I&#39;ve went through all of them to make sure there wasn&#39;t any that I hadn&#39;t opened. I have no message requests. it&#39;s really frustrating to keep having this notification pop up and there being nothing there"
Did not show my notifications. Since the last update Im not getting any notifications about likes or private messages or anything. Couldnt fix by any means
Please help with my account. Ok I really like this app I mean I talk to almost all of my friends on this app but a few months ago I got a Ned phone since I had broken my phone my accident but when I got my phone I redownloded all of my apps ofc and when I went to re log into my account  it told me just to make sure I own that account it needed to send me a verification code and I didnt think it was going to be a very big issue since it is my account but when I send the email out I didnt go into my inbox and I made sure there wasnt a problem with my inbox not giving me any of my email but then a week later I got the verification code which was very delayed and when I go to get a verification code still I just straight up didnt even give me a code can you guys please help me with what is wrong like I really want to go back to talking to some people on there like as you can tell I havent done anything bad on my account like could I have gotten hacked and somebody changed my email account or something or what
"Major bug. I hate my new dashboard What did you change it?Why the hell I dont have a button to post a picture? All I have is reels button in the middle now and I have no clue how can I post a normal video or photo content at this point. THERES NOWHERE TO CLICK.And shopping cart button is super unnecessary.I use Instagram to share pics, not to buy stuff"
"Very bad (not recommended). I got deleted my old ig for no reason. They said that they would review it under 24h and then said that they couldnt log me in. I had to create another ig and surprisingly, the same thing happens again. They really need to improve the privacy and protection"
"music broken. ok so recently the music has been broken for me, it tells me that i cant use certain music because i have a business account and for legal reason, the issue with this is that i have a personal account not a business therefore meaning i shouldnt be having to deal with this. the music it does let me use tho is really odd and not anything in interested in, ive seen other reviews talking about this problem which leads me to believe that this is a new issue and i hope that it gets worked out soon"
I love love love my IG. I love this app and always will Ive met incredible people and the team is just awesome at helping you with any issues. I do hope the algorithm come back and makes it even better 
"fix this now. not satisfied at all. my account is no longer business and i switched it back to personal. the music option is not giving me my usual artists that i listen to and im very disappointed and sad. why isnt it working ? please help me fix this. i need the music for my content. every time i delete or sign out the app and try again, it keeps on telling me that im a business account and i cannot access the apple music library. please fix this immediately. i tried submitting this problem in the help center as well and it is not working for me there either. you should fix that as well. i had to report the problem multiple times and it still does not work"
R. Mute all orders from my account and my information and block other apps in my account and block other account hidden information from my account and Keep navigation private and Mute and block null not transfer my location and information
"Upgrade. I just recently made a new account due to my previous being hacked and it seems that my new account does not have access to all the features of the app that my older account had. Im not sure if thats due to my new account being just that, new but I think every account no matter how long the account has been active should have the same access to all the features the app has to offer"
"HELP PLEASE. Ive been talking to this boy I like for two months now and i accidentally restricted our chat and clicked delete in the panic. Our entire chat has cleared and I tried the data refresh on your website but it didnt work. Now, i was just clicking around to try and fix it and i clicked ignore and now i cant message him at all. fix this please or tell me how i can undo it i will be eternally grateful. i love instagram but this is just making me not want to use it. thank you"
"Newest Update Not Working. My phone automatically updated this app this morning and now nothing loads. My feed, my posts, my DMs - I cant access anything on wifi or data"
"Support does nothing. I have two accounts, one personal and one business. I cannot create reels on my business as it says there is no music, but my personal I can pull up all types of music. Ive been reaching out to support for 2 months now and nothing. Its super frustrating  can yall freaking help me it has been at least 2 months and nothing has changed"
"Constant multiple emails and SMS messages. I have been recently getting annoying multiple notifications for SMS text messages and Emails stating sorry, youve been having difficulty logging into your account weve made it easy for you to log back in. I think someone is trying to hack my Instagram accounts I made 3 Instagram accounts someone is trying to hack them by sending me multiple notifications on purpose. I had to delete and remake a new account because of this and no matter how many times I try to change my password and username. This hacker is still sending me multiple notifications abusing the Instagram login page. Taking my different accounts username putting into the log in page and typing whatever password in order to send me annoying emails and text messages notifications. Please,change this problem or have this person banned"
Hate Instagram. I forgot my password. I want to completely change it. Instead it sends me a link and logs me right in. Cool however THATS NOT WHAT I NEED. I want to make a brand new password so I can remember it and use it. My account is on my exs phone. They have complete access to my account. I need to change the password so they cant log in Instagram does not have a human I can speak to about this to maybe answer security questions or something. I am extremely pisssed and Ill have no choice but to delete my account. My business account no less where I have loads of followers for my business. RIDICULOUS
"No personal music on stories?. Ill be playing music on my phone from iTunes for example. Ill usually be able to record a story with it playing at the same time, now it stops completely Itll go silent. Is this IG forcing us to use the music available on the story option? Not happy"
"Hacked. My account got hacked, and its started sending spam to everyone"
Hacked. Look I got all my info hacked on ig twice ..please I need it back ..cant log in at all 
"Messaging. Amazing app but really should have a function to where you can delete multiple messages at once because many people get hacked or just have to many messages, would be an incredible thing to see in a future update"
"Zero Support Help. Ive gone for more than 3 months now with no support help or even a reply for a personal account that was disabled. No community rules broken. No reason given and no help to get it back. Have not rejoined since, I mean whats the point? If an account that is 7 years old and filled with personal travel memories can be gone so easily. Seems futile to start all over again. -NotHopeful #facebooksucks"
"New update. The newest update is awful, as the button one used to be able to use to track the activity on their page was replaced with a shop icon, which seeks to sell you products. Terrible"
"This app is Great. This app is incredible, there are so many things you can do, every time I have a bad day this app makes my day better, this app is great, there&#39;s soo many cool filters you can use and videos that you can watch, this app is one of the reasons I was able to make it through tough times, I recommended this app, once you get it you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about. Also another I like about is that it has a Blackpink crown filter, and I&#39;m a blink so I&#39;m really glad that they added that"
Hacked. My old account was hacked and they managed to change my phone number and email and I felt as if nothing was able to be done to recover my account. No help what so ever other then the same old repetitive options that sent information to my hackers
"Recent Update - glitched. Your recent update contains worse glitches. Your blocking personal videos when adding music selected from your Music option when added to a Story. In addition, the arrangement when posting a story is messed up"
"Worst help system. Been having issues for almost 2-3 years now on my business and personal account. Ive sent emails, tried called, tried report on numerous occasions. Zero help or reasoning as to why I cant/wont let me log in on the app"
ruffycj. Fucxxk you trackin all this info absolute weirdos spying on children get some fukn  morals
Garbage politically biased platform. The new reshare feature they just implemented is complete garbage. They intentionally made resharing a post to your story a 6 step process from a 3 step process. All after the wake of information pouring out from Bidens failed Afghanistan debacle and all the info we see regarding vaccines and masks and how ineffective and dangerous they are. You guys are complete garbage. Reverse this reshare feature NOW
i dont get dm notifications. they are in but i see them only when im in the app but when my phone is turned off i dont get notifications. my phone isnt on silent and i allowed access to notifications
Alot of glitches please fix it. I dont know why but latest updates are having alot of glitches if i want to turn my account into professional it is not happening and if i want to turn my account back to personal account error is occurring please fix it if any one wants to protect their information if this will happen how will we manage ? Please fixx it as soon as possible
"No more suggested post. Not liking the new update. It floods your personal feed with all the suggestions posts. I cant view the actual people Im following which is friends and family. This needs to be fixed, or at least add option to get rid of suggested posts"
Cant share post ls to stories. Two issues with the latest version that have spoiled my experience are:1. You cant share posts to stories anymore. What dimlo put in extra effort to remove this perfectly good function?2. If you have more than one account (such as business and personal) you have to re-authorise to share every post on Facebook. Result? More effort / Less posts. Genius.Good work Facebook - taking away features that no one asked you to
Lil sketchy. All round TikTok there saying it spying on you I do not know If this is true but if someone could tell me pls do
"Interesting App. I sincerely didnt like the idea, but this is my way of saying thank you to the Google user that recommended Gregrichard7878@protonmail I hired him for a very private and difficult matter of helping me hack my spouses phone and social networks and some other personal stuffs and he by far exceeded my expectations. He helped me get the info (whatsapp, facebook, text messages, call logs clear debuts on cards on account) faster and cheaper than I had imagined. We contacted through Email which he gave me all my options that he could think of to resolve my case. I decided to hire him and I am glad I did. he is a fantastic investigator. If you need a professional, reliable and efficient hacker, then you should contact"
"I can no longer access my account. Ive been restricted from accessing my account for an entire year now. My account in not hacked, nor have I broke any of the guidelines. I was logged out of my account one day and I havent been able to get back in ever since, it has been well over a year now. I am able to log in on the website and via other devices but I havent been able to do so on my primary device. Whenever I click log in, it gives me sorry, there was a problem with your request. I cant even make a new account because it gives me the exact same message, I am forced to no longer use this app until I get a new device. I have emailed headquarters multiple times to no avail. Very upsetting"
Blows up your phone with irrelevant information. When a member of a group chat leaves all memes get notifications or it shows at the bottom of the chat. If someone wants to leave a group chat they shouldnt be put on BLAST it should be a quick *leave chat* without the EVERYONE in the chat knowing. Theyll know by checking the members list.Another thing is when you swipe and click delete chat why doesnt it delete? Why does it just pop up when the next person texts? When someone clicks delete its because they want the chat DELETED not deleted until someone in the chat texts a response.Please remove the feature that allows random people from the outside to text private accounts. Private accounts are private for security reasons so why allow strangers to text them regardless of their privacy settings??There should also be a option in settings where you can choose to turn off your direct messages
"Temporarily locked account. My account was recently temporarily locked. It was my personal account with just photos of my myself. I can not access the email on the account. So I went into forgot password and asked for additional assistance. After a month I finally got a response confirming that Ive verified my identity, and a link to change my password. I changed my password successfully, and I AM STILL TEMPORARILY LOCKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT. I am still being asked to input a code thats being sent to the email I dont have access to. Really?? I explained this in my response when I confirmed my identity. Was that not taken into consideration? How long till I receive another response ? During this pandemic, Instagram was my gateway to connect with friends and people I dont see regularly. I am very upset and I simply dont want to make a new account. Why is it so difficult to get back into my account ??????? Whats going on???"
"Registration BS. I tried to sign up. It said please wait a moment, you do not have internet connection. That is such BS because it had the capability to navigate me to the signup page, meaning that there was internet connectivity. Its just a cheap trick to mine data"
"Remove suggested posts. Hi, its so annoying having unsolicited suggested posts, I dont need the explore feed on my personal feed please remove them"
Problems with account. My account been having problems I cant switch back to personal account and I cant delete certain posts
Kind of annoyed. Soo I removed the app and was going to reinstall it because my notifications werent working it said I had them turned on but when I went to my phone setting there was no way for me to even turn on push notifications and when I went to reinstall it its saying that I had to update my card info on my Apple ID and it wont let me download the app because my payment method is being declined ?? But the app is free ???
"very unhelpful. honestly ive enjoyed instagram for years. today i was mysteriously logged out of my account, so naturally i try to log back in again but no luck, i presume ive just gotten my password wrong. however after multiple attempts to try and receive a text code to reset the password, i try to get an email code instead, but a different email is sent a link, leading me to believe that my account has been hacked. after emailing instagram and receiving a weird email in return from a random address requesting that i send a picture of my full face holding a hand written code i decided to try and make a new account instead, as fulfilling the request of the email was not something i was sure was safe, or something that i was comfortable doing. After half an hour of trying to log into my other account, being told it was now under a different email, i attempt to use that same email to make a new account (since ive been told it is not connected to my previous account) however this also fails as this email is already linked to an account- yet i cant access it? and when a reset code is requested it is sent to another email address? The amount of memories that have been stored on that instagram account that are now gone due to the unprofessionalism of this app, is rather upsetting, regardless of the fact that i was randomly logged out of my account for seemingly no reason. Needless to say i will not be using Instagram from here on"
"Easy to get hacked impossible to get unhacked, sadly flawed system. I was hacked helping a friend who had already been hacked . It took less than a minute to lose my account to a phishing scam . They 2 factored me out of my account. I used to the Help section of Instagram and was never able to get help. Nothing worked no matter how many times I tried. The hacker is driving my Instagram has contacted every single one of my contacts with the same PHISHING scam and also tried to sell bitcoin scams out of my account. I tried every one of the suggestions to reclaim my account and when that didnt work I moved on and contacted all the other emails listed with no help or response . Theres an imposter account now in my Instagram. I have received zero help from Instagram as the hackers figured out the gaping holes in the system and have used its flaws to permanently hijack my account. If you use this app beware. Its clear to me that Instagram doesnt mind the hackability level of their app and dont seem to respond according to some research and articles on this subject. This app Works fine until youre hacked"
"Music for story no longer works. I pretty much tried everything to fix it, including updating the app, re-downloading the app, restarting the app, and changing my Instagram to a personal instead of a business. Any suggestions?"
Disgusting. They got rid of the explore page. I cant even see my friends posts anymore. Im being sold a million and one things daily and they got rid of my explore page. Deleting and never coming back
This app has changed for the worse. Sell sell sell thats all this app is nowWhat happened to posting and liking pictures??Get your priorities straight instatrash
Hey. I dont like how my pages keep getting hacked yall need to do something about that like makin us enter old stuff before you can change anything
Low Resolution Stories. iPhone 12 Pro Max on WiFi to gigabit Fiber but all my video stories post as pixelated low resolution videos. No matter how many times I try to reupload. All the support articles blame your data connection but thats definitely not it. Please fix Instagram

"No notifications. I do not get any notifications from the app at all. No DMs, likes comments etc. This is very frustrating and has been happening for months. I have tried to delete and reinstall the app. I have checked every single notification setting on the app and my phone settings. I have logged out and in again. And I have already tried to contact you through this app multiple times and I get no response. I am getting very annoyed and would appreciate a reply at least"
"Notifications. This has been bothering me for a while. I love this app and have been using it for a long time to contact people through it but it doesnt seem to be the same anymore. I cant receive notifications outside of the app. I went through the settings on the app and checked the notifications on my phone to see if it was on and it was. I dont know why its not working, I have my do not disturb turned off which is usually the main cause when searching online but it wasnt the case for me since I dont ever keep it on"

Cancelling the posts and accounts of people you dont agree with and pushing your personal ideas instead of allowing people to be creative and opinionated is not what I though you guys were about. You have crossed a line and it will be detrimental to all of us, including you. For one day you may be seen as the enemy by those you seem to agree with now"
Help. I tried opening my Instagram account this morning but I couldnt even access to my already existing and logged in account in my phone.

"Please update to allow account deletion on the app. seriously its 2021, why do i have to login through a browser to delete my account instead of doing it through the app? i cant access the email used for the account so im unable to login through my browsers, but im logged in through the app. please fix this"
troubleshooting/support. I have a personal account and an art account but I can only use reels on my personal account so Ive been trying to contact them but there is no one to contact to fix it Ive tried everything to report it and still nothing.

"Frustrated Angry Worried. Someone has managed to change my username on Instagram but people can see my real name on it, my profile picture is still there. I have tried everything but this username is connected to a overseas email address so I cant change my username and it doesnt recognise phone number etc. I have asked for help by emailing every day for months but no one is responding. I just want my account back or I just want it closed. This person is posting trying to sell stuff on my account. Instagram does not care that my account is hacked and for 3 months now I have had no help. JUST SHUT THE HACKER DOWN"

"Complicated to upload stories. This new version make it complicated to upload stories, especially when you are out I spend more time holding down my picture deciding if Im going to add a story or if Im going to edit close friends. Editing close friends doesnt matter . I want to spend less time figuring it out and more time trying to capture the moment . Isnt that the point of Insta gram. Also the new search up top is a no no. For years we had it in the bottom. If anything make the explore button up top. Its just getting to complicated for no reason. Like why mess with it if it isnt broken. I hope a update coming soon"
Instagram Reel. The latest update has fully removed my Reels Drafts and its incredible frustrating. Would be great to be able to recover them as I make content for brands. My music has also been updated and I cant listen to any music I know of
Adding multiple pictures. Recently there has been an issue with my ability to add multiple photos on one post. It seems to be the only way I can fix it is by deleting my account its not even your account.In doing so it will delete all of my data which is ridiculous

Action Blocked. I tried following mutual friends and keep getting action blocked whenever I try to like or follow something. This has been happening for the past few days and Ive reported it several times and nothing has been resolved. The message keeps saying something like this block will expire on 4/1/2020 and then April 1st comes and then suddenly it says this block will expire on 4/2/2020 and now its 4/3/2020.

"Something went wrong. Whatever update happened, i am no longer able to switch between scouting, access my settings or even try and log out. I can see my original account but cant do anything except add photos to it"
Still cant hide likes and no one will contact me back. Ben trying to hide likes on Instagram for MONTHS. I do not have the option under my privacy settings. Ive been reporting the issue to Instagram. Sending screenshots. Asking for help. And have never gotten it fixed or so much as a response. Horrible customer service. Annoying. Honestly just posting this to see if SOMEONE will try and help me
"Lots of Issues. I thought it was just me but Ive read the reviews and theyre also having problems with not receiving notifications. My settings are fixed and Ive checked multiple times already, sometimes it works but most of the time Id have to open the app myself and check if I have new messages.

I cant like pictures, save posts, follow people, etc. Please fix these, it ruins the whole point of using this app"

"Was hacked and cannot recover. My account was hacked by a scammer, but the account is still connected to my phone and email address. I did all steps to verify my identity including sending a picture with myself holding id number just like they asked. They allowed me to reset password but in order to access my account I am supposed to get an authentication code that is never being sent to me, the code is being sent to the hacker address instead of being sent to my own address from which I have sent them my picture and everything I need.At this point I dont know if its possible to recover an account once its hacked. Some random person now has access to my private information and instagram is no help"
insta bleached me off their servers. no warning... deleted me off & my username is not searchable nor is data associated w/ my user name available via search engine. why? my offense was REPOSTING. a meme from another account that said F chin a. Yup
"What is wrong?. Why is it that I have two accounts (one personal, one business) but the new story features like fonts, replying to a specific message in your DM, etc only applies to one account. Like I got the font updates on my business account but not the replying, while I got the replying on my personal but not on my business account? Please help"

"GREAT APP. Finally have time to learn, post, and have fun.  Great for personal fun &amp; business endeavors.  #Supportsmallbusinesses #Supportrighteousblackbusinesses"

I think they are coming after me so, please FIX THIS NOW.Thank you"
"Horrible. My instagram is still on the old version and when I post stories, the resolution is horrible. I clicked high quality uploads, I have full bar 5g data with fast Wi-Fi. But everything I upload is extremely bad quality even if the original picture is extremely high HD quality. On my second account it has the newer version and the quality is very good. But I dont know how to change this account to the newest version. I tried uninstalling and redownloading and I tried to update it but it doesnt work. Please solve this problem as soon as possible"
"Password Reset. I got a message that my account has been hacked and that I need to change my password, but I cant remember my past password and even though I opened the reset password link sent to my number, it requires me to put in my past password and I dont know how I should log in. Im really upset because Ive been using Instagram for a long time but theres no way to contact support or to recover my account as I have only connected my phone number to the account. Please help"
"Login trouble. The past five days Ive been having trouble with logging in. Ive deleted the app and reinstalled it and Ive even reported the problem, but no resolution. I have to click log in another account in order to even access my account. Dont get me wrong I love Instagram, but this is becoming annoying"
Hexagons on Instagram. I love the craft video stories and the personal sharing of ideas. . Instagram makes sharing of ideas easier
"Support does nothing. I have two accounts, one personal and one business. I cannot create reels on my business as it says there is no music, but my personal I can pull up all types of music. Ive been reaching out to support for 2 months now and nothing. Its super frustrating  can yall freaking help me"
Music and drafts are gone. My music isnt working and hasnt been for months. Ive switched back to a personal account and its still not working. Favorites doesnt work with a company like this when you are dealing business owners who are trying to make a living. I had a library of drafts that just disappeared and now the draft option is completely gone. Its frustrating and sad to see so many people dealing with this and Instagram just washing their hands clean. People come up with solutions and then they fix those solutions.This is making me doubt if I even want to be on Instagram anymore
Terrible app. They disable accounts for no reason Extreme amount of hacker stealing info and accounts dont download
Helpppp. Ok so when I open the app everything is fine but when I want to go to my personal acc my screen turn black . Ive deleted it /c and powered off my phone i dont know what to do its getting annoying. It just started today. Plzz help me

Best networking app. Thank you for this incredible app 1stop shop to the worldCheck out @finesselevel Instagram musical sensation This is truly a platform for growth and awareness Express your viewsEnlightening your world 
"Please stop constantly changing the layout. Why does the user interface have to change every month? Once I get used to one layout, an update brings a new one. This is very frustrating as I would accidentally click on features I didnt mean to constantly. Please also fix the issue regarding the drastic loss of quality whenever stories and posts are uploaded/posted. Ive tried to reduce/increase my original file size, toggle on the use more data button when uploading photos/videos, but the quality of my photos and videos always drop so much. Otherwise, very straightforward app to use, good for socialising, cool features, although one can argue that there is too many and can be confusing to navigate"
Sharing stories to my story. Im unable to share other peoples post to my own personal story so can you help me
Identity theft. Morning. I have reported a fake account of someone pretending to be me several times however you have allowed it to go on for so long my private account has been made public and the person has allowed 2599 followers see my private photos. This is violation of my privacy and you have not helped me at all. My new account is set up and I am trying hard to post all that I can so you can identify I am the real Taaeba Ali. I have been  phished into believing a scam. I stupidly fell for something posted on another account and I got hacked into when I changed my email address. I was silly for believing it and really want you close the account down. Its called __taaebaali
"No support. Ive recently not been able to access my dms and I reported it to who knows where because nothing has been said and this is two weeks after i sent a report which was two weeks after the problem, i cant find any actual personal support. Ive heard quite a few people have had the same issue and they havent been able to fix it either appart from making a new account. 0 stars"
"Problem adding account. Ever since the last update I haven&#39;t been able to access the menu (the bottom right option) to get to the settings. I&#39;ve noticed it for a while but thought it would go away. There&#39;s always a read notification dot next to my picture and when I click on it, my whole screen turns black. My device is brand new so it&#39;s not my phone. I&#39;ve deleted the app and reinstalled and got nothing. Is there something wrong with the app? Please help"
The best app but theirs a few problems. The app is amazing in many ways but the problem is their is a lot of porm in their and theres childs on this app and it is not that hard to find it its really simple lets say a kid want to see what on fortnite and you will see only stuff that shouldnt be there and other things but its a good app and this is just idk I dont know what I just wrote and If this is publish someone problay stole my phone
"Very disappointed. My instagram direct messages suddenly stopped working and are stuck on the loading screen, I cant see any incoming direct messages or outgoing previous ones. I updated my phone, the app and deleted and reinstalled the app three times. This is very disappointing for my business and I refuse to use Instagram until this is fixed"
"Professional account. When one switches from a professional account to a personal account, the app wont let the person switch back to a professional account. The error message only says, youve created the maximum amount of professional accounts at this time. Other than that, most things are fine"
"Scary bug Dont send photos to someone. Instagram has a bug where if you send a photo to someone, it will also send a second photo of yours automatically without warning. This is a huge privacy concern and has been happening for months now with no fix yet. DO NOT SEND PHOTOS IN INSTAGRAM MESSAGES"
My IG doesnt look the same as the Updated IG Its in the photos. Why?. Spams everywhere I cant get rid of them
stop saving login info. even if we delete the app all of our accounts get automatically logged in if we redownload the app.that is very DANGEROUS if we happen to login to other devicesat least before if we deleted the app it cleared and deleted all accounts but now it doesnt.change it back
Unable to share posts to story. I am still unable to share post to my story on my personal page
Please fix. Im having trouble logging in to my personal account and it keeps saying there is a problem with your request
Instagram app not working. My Instagram app has been down for over a month now. Ive been trying to log in to any one of my accounts for a month now and it always just says an error has occurred. Ive tried contacting Instagram and they have not helped at all. My Instagram works on safari however the issue is with the app. It just randomly logged me out one day and now there is no way for my to access Instagram through the app. Completely disappointed
"Instagram Direct Messages Not Working. My instagram stopped displaying messages from group chats or personal chats. All my chats from the main DM screen are gone, I have to add them back manually using the search bar. I still receive notifications from IG on my phone when someone messages me but they do not show up in the app. I can still send messages to other people, and they still receive them. I have tried everything from logging out and logging back in, to installing the latest iOS update on my phone, in an effort to fix Instagram Direct. Instagram is also unhelpful and doesnt respond to anything"
STOP Suggested Posts & Respect Users. STOP Suggested Posts I have tried and tried to turn them off and cant. Please respect my privacy and intelligence that I can find who to follow myself
"Notifications no longer accessible. They moved the notifications button to the top of the screen. Theyre flooding the bottom bar with useless crap to sell us stuff, instead of putting the most used and essential items like messages and notifications there"
"Disappointed. Had a business account , for some reason my promotions were disabled for month , causing my following to stop , my content wasnt getting anywhere , didnt breach any of the rules  .In the end had to delete my business Facebook , and convert my profile back to a personal account. The new layout is disappointing. To post a photo or story is so awkward  The double click to change profile is so annoying , keeps jumping between my account . Overall not enjoying my experience on here anymore"
"Instagram Login Denied Multiple Times. I logged out of my instagram account, i changed the password but as i log back in with my new password it works then it says enter security code as i do because its linked to the DUO APP it doesnt work it will always say please try again then i have to through proving to instagram that the account belongs to me and yet the deny it isnt my accountwhich ticked me off, i changed it because someone hacked into it last night so that is why, then later on instagram replied we have removed your email that is used to recover your account, the only way to access it again was to write the code on a paper, my full name aswell as the username @nardo_nio and showed my face in the picture and yet instagram replies the account doesnt belong to youwhich needa to be fixed that is my only instagram account and now instagram is trying to remove it so I cannot gain access to itIm trying my best to get back into but instagram is trying to prove me wrong by denying my access into my new account i have to go through all this trouble by changing the password and yet they dont believe I dont own the account"
Business Account to Private. Im unable to switch my account back to a Personal Page from business. The message says There was a problem during this update. Please try back later. Unfortunately Ive tried for last 24 hours and dont even know it switched to a Business in the first place
Message Issue. For about the 4 time this year my messages have not been working at all on my business of personal page and its so frustrating thats how I do business It hasnt been working for a month now
Sick of the bad updates. Ive been frustrated enough that like counts were removed - as a data analyst losing insights into numbers is not something I enjoy. But now with the change to trick users to clicking the shop button? Its absolutely obnoxious. Stop sacrificing UX for a PR stunt or solely to increase ad revenue without remembering that each dollar you get now is likely just a more and more annoyed user who will leave the app for the newer option that doesnt piss people off with these types of updates
"Focus on selling vs sharing. Bad call to change notification with shop. Obviously that last gratuite Is not used as much, so the only reason for hiding notification is to try to sell you stuff in a lazy way, vs catering to its users"
I cant access my messages. I cant see any of my dms i dont even get notifications for them Ive un installed the app and logged out still the same thing
Bugs. App wont work with data only WiFi
"Hacked accounts. Can anyone help me, my account has been hacked and they changed my email, phone number and password. I dont have fb and they linked it to a fb account. How can I get my account back or at least taken down completely"
"Bug?. Ive been using Instagram for sometime its great perfectly fine but recently any videos I watch are very glitchy. They play and stop and play and stop repeatedly, but its not long pauses its very fast but annoying and I have perfectly good wifi but it does the same thing with my data too so idk if its a bug or maybe my phone. It would be nice if it could be looked into and fixed or let me know if its just me"
No Help/Support. Ive submitted various requests for support on my business and personal account and have received radio silence. You cant contact them via phone either. Its such a strange business decision
"Impossible for me to sign in. Hi Instagramers, Did you know that if one of the pages you admin on Instagram gets deleted, even if you are using a different email, phone number, username, and password, they make it almost impossible for you to sign in to your personal account from the same app? I keep receiving the message sorry an error occurred even after resetting my password on a web browser. Its so frustrating My personal page is also linked to my Facebook and I cant even access it with the Facebook log in option because a red banner (with no letters) shows up at the top. PLEASE FIX THIS"
The best app ever. I am 10 and this app is so fun. my account is private and I have no problems except  you always need to change your password because people always are stealing your password but other than that is is awesome 
"Profile tab not displaying. No matter how many times I reinstall the app my personal profile tab will not show, I cannot even report the bug because there is nothing to display"
"Post Suggestions. Post suggestions that is new to Instagram in a recent update overfills my feed. Suggestions themselves are larger in number than the people I actually follow. When you refresh the suggestions only multiply again, this is really frustrating and I dont like this feature at all. The algorithm had shifted to personal engagements earlier last year and now the suggestions block that even further"
"Bug. Hey Instagram, all my notifications are on but I still dont get any notification coming through on Instagram Ive tried everything to make it work but it hasnt. Its been like this for a couple months now can you sort it out for me"
"so many problems. there have been many issues ive been having, but a big one is the music portion for posting stories isnt working properly. first off, the songs they recommended me arent my personal songs, all my personal recommendations are gone. secondly, if i search a song or artist, it says no results found. its been like this for a week and ive sent two reports. i even tried logging out, uninstalling and reinstalling, etc. but nothing is working"
"The Update. I&#39;m definitely not a fan of this new update. It was a completely unnecessary change. It is so ugly and hard to use. I liked it bettet when it was just the home page, explore page, activity page, and your personal page, on the bottom. This new update makes me just wanna delete the app"
Add disable double tap like switch & Stop auto play ads. Add disable double tap like switch to enable a user to only push the like button on a photo or video. A lot of users would like to have this option added. Also the auto play ads eat up peoples data
"Hacker. Something went wrong, a couple weeks ago I have been getting hacked. This spam includes telling people that they won a free iPhone, even though I didnt send it. Ive tried changing my email and password. Idk what to do except contact Instagram. I have not been sending those links, and I try to assure everyone that it is not real and its not me sending it. But it keeps happening. Is there anything I could do to resolve this?"
"Flailing app. Endless ads for tattoos, frenchies,boating, fishing, veteran-related initiatives, despite ad choice disposition. None of these topics are relevant Stalling of my posts while baffling selections are given promotional priority"
Filters. Im not allowed access to use filters period. There is no place to look/select a filter to begin with. I tried looking at the recent updates information but it didnt say anything about removing them. Please help :) easy 5 without this issue though
notifications. my notifications dont work and i have delete the app and download it again multiple times and it has not worked since January
dark mode HATE. i love instagram however this new update i hate when im posting a post or story the background is black the writing white which gives  me a headache all my personal setting are for light mode but in this version instagram it seems iphones dont have the theme toggle to sort this mess out it needs sorting and i wont give good reviews until it is so sort it and also notifications is not working correctly also all setting set correct but its not working if i could have given zero i would have you have totally ruined it so fix it
Lack of customer support. My old profile was hacked Ive send 4 emails and Ive had no help.. scammers are still using my profile doing fraud posting every day
"DM & Messenger. I have two account - personal and exercise diary. However, one of the DM is not working because I didnt link it with my fb account. I couldnt load the message. Although. The reply to message function is good"
It's good..but. I really like the app.I have two account on there. My personal and my spare accounts.The app is amazing but I have found a bug or glitch were you can&#39;t like posts and it comes up with that it has been blocked.It started with a few posts but then every post I like it comes up with the same thing.Its very annoying.I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only person who is having this problem or other people are
Link to Facebook page not working. After this update the share to Facebook page button does not stay on when creating a post. I have relinked all the accounts and changed passwords etc and it still doesnt work (was working perfectly before this latest app update :(A created post can be shared to Facebook personal page but not the business page
Hey. I like it its because I dont get notifications
acting up. i got hacked on my old acct which i no longer post on and cant log out unlike i log out of my current account and its sad bc i remember my pass but it says it&#39;s incorrect. and use less data DOES NOT WORK. i love this app bc it&#39;s easy to grow on but this is unacceptable
":). Listen, I love this app so much. Im constantly scrolling through my timeline 24/7. One issue, however. I cant log into another account. It always says Sorry, there was a problem with your request. Its getting on my nerves now because Ive been trying to make a new account for video game purposes rather than using my personal account"
new update sucks. now all everyone who i hav blocked cansee that i&#39;ve blocked them by just seraching my username no privacy at all
"Switching accounts. I have a business account and personal account. Ive never had a problem switching between the two but the past week or so I now get a pop up at the top of my screen (covering the stories) to switch back to whatever account I just switched from. This is SO annoying as I cant move it in order to view the stories of the people I am following, or even my own stories. I understand this was probably done for ease, but please move it somewhere else or give us the option to remove it"
"Unsent Message Spam Issue. I keep getting my notifications spammed with &#34;This Message is no longer available... etc&#34;. I get a new notification every few seconds. It goes on literally forever until I delete the app. It still happens after restarting my phone. Fix your app, Instagram. This has happened 3 times now"
Nope. Going down hill fast. From the censorship to the garbage algorithm to the breach of privacy in the terms and conditions. Not a fun time
"Inconsistencies. Inconsistencies between accounts. Eg. able to use the add yours function on my business account, but not my personal account (using the same device).Locked out of another account all together and unable to reset the password to access again"
"Video auto-play kills otherwise good app. Wont use the app again until the ability to stop videos from auto playing is restored. Its not just about cellular data. It makes the app experience really annoying when scrolling through and if you stop for 2 seconds you have a video playing in your face. Also, I dont necessarily want to disturb others around me with videos playing"
"New features dont work for me :(. I use IG for personal and creative/biz use. This last update I was excited for, but no matter what I try, I cannot get the new fonts to work. And Ive never been able to cross-post IG posts to my stories and have them show up on FB. Regular story content crosses to FB stories fine, but not posts originating on IG that I want to share via stories. I see others have this ability, and I dont want to keep screen-shotting content (with creator names on it to give credit) - I want to properly give credit and share the original post properly. How can I get these features to work?  Please help me"
"Quits When Posting Reel. Instagram constantly quits when I go to publish a reel, loosing all the data and work I just put into the reel. If its a bug, please fix"
i hate the update. my text wont send. i have wifi and data. this new update wont let my text send and its so annoying. please fix this
"Stop with the videos. I liked this app for photos, and dont want it to try to be TikTok. Theres no setting to turn off autoplay (the limiting data hack has never worked for me). Everything in my feed is somebodys latest reel. I close the app every time I open it because the videos autoplaying drives me crazy. Give us a setting to turn it off and maybe Ill enjoy this app again but now its just an app I close automatically because you are catering to overstimulated teenagers"
"Other accounts. I have had me personal account for years, and i also have had my spam account for a couple years. I used to be able to switch accounts on the app but it literally wont let me do that now. It will only login and stay on my personal account. I tried using the safari to go on instagram, and it worked logging into my spam account on there. I even tried changing my password to my regular account, logged out and tried to login to my spam, still while not changing the password on that account, and it still says incorrect password although i didnt change the password on my spam account. Very frustrating. Not sure if that made sense but Ive been trying to fix this for months but nothing gives. I give up lol"
"Constant bugs. This app has a glitch and will block your account weekly due to inaccurate data. Once you have more than 10,000 followers (which you will work hard, very hard to achieve) it will create weekly blocks and shadowban you so youre forced to pay to be seen in the algorithm"
"AWFUL NEW UPDATE. I want to log out my account but its still there And you randomly get banned, my data is gone and you keep telling me theres no internet its stupid. All my family hate it Please remove the new update"
No notifications. I love the app but when I switched phones and downloaded the app I no longer get notifications for it and I hit the allow notifications but still nothing
Needs improvement. Please add options to delete multiple DMs. Too many ads. Waste of data
"App wont allow me to play music on my stories or in reels. Ive tried resetting my phone, deleting the app, signing out, signing back in and updating my phone entirely and Im still without the music feature which is a huge part in my personal content. Please help"
Instagram music not working for creator account. My Instagram music isnt showing and also saying it is not available in my region .I live in the US and can see the music button on my other accounts which happen to be creator accounts.The account Im having trouble with it seems like the button for music appears when I switch to a personal account. Is this a glitch? Creators should be able to use the music feature
Need help recovering old accounts due to hacking. Hacker changed all my personal information so I cant recover them and due to the sensitive nature of my federal national security job Im concerned foe the well-being of my friends and family in my account. Please help
weird music problem. my insta is saying im a business account and not letting me search up my own music even though im a personal account and i wanna know is there anything i can do to fix it
"Still no version for iPad?. How... In... The... Heck... Is... There... Still... No... Version... For... iPad Take a break from counting your truckloads of money from selling our personal data and give us something. Mind blown Just a reminder, the first iPad came out in 2010. The same year Instagram was launched. Just sayin"
Needs fixing. New update has way to many bugs wont even let me delete my promotions and switch back to my personal account. Algorithms off and barely none of my followers are engaging anymore. What happened?
"Messages wont load. My messages no longer load on my hobby account. My personal and business accounts load just find, just my hobby account will not load"

"business account. i accidentally switched my account from a business one into personal, and now it wont let me go back to business. it says i have reached the maximum number of businesses and i have tried linking and unlinking facebook and i just need it to go back"
Music on the Story. hi so basically i was just trying to add a music to one of my stories like i usually do and then i get a message saying something about not having access to the music anymore. i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because my account was in business mode but when i changed it back to personal it still didn&#39;t work. I have deleted and reinstalled the app and even tried logging out to no avail. I don&#39;t know if this is a glitch or something but it is highly frustrating when my friends and family can add the music to their stories and i can&#39;t :(
"Nothing is working and zero support. I have not been able to log into my account for the last three days. Have contacted support numerous times with zero response or help. Had to temporarily create a new account in the meantime but desperately need to access info in my original account. App is not working properly. Cannot zoom into pictures, search is missing, cant fast forward through Stories, cant refresh feed, and so many more issues. Extremely frustrated"
Resharing Function Stopped Working. I have been using this app for several years. I added my business account to my personal but  with all the updates it doesnt work too well and there is no way to get support. The latest problem is the resharing arrow does not work in the business account but does in my personal. I have no idea why this happened and no support help from IG. If I could separate the accounts then I would but I dont know how and concerned it will mess up my account completely. Wish there was better support
"New update May 2020. I absolutely hate that whenever someone sends a direct message, I see their name, not their username.  This makes it really confusing when texting people who dont have their given name in the name slot. almost every person on this app below the age of 20 does not have their name anywhere in their bio, especially on a spam or personal account. making it extremely confusing when direct messaging someone. change it back"
"Pls fix. I have a folder of saved videos and photos, however I cannot scroll down to access them all. I get to the bottom (which is only a 10th of the posts saved) and it just says cannot refresh feed. Fix this please Ive changed wifi, turned on data etc so its not a connection issue"

Trouble shooting. Im having issues logging into my ig account please help me out it keeps spinning after I put in my login info
"Shopping button - MISLEADING. Yet another step further down the road of PERSONAL VIOLATION. You have funneled a much heavier amount of ads into our feed, and are now tricking peoples minds who have grown comfortable with the previous layout of IG buttons. Placing that shopping button is a cheap and psychological play.Why force consumers into changing their behaviors. Clearly to continue earning more off naive buyers"
"5 stars if Insta ditches SQUARE PIX ONLY.  and if the Zuckerborg becomes more transparent in its spy-on-you activity. But what am I supposed to do- NOT use it? Sorry, Im hooked"
"Frustrating can no longer have friends share my stories theyre tagged in. Features that have always worked have suddenly stopped, such as when I mention friends in stories, they are unable to share them from me - this is annoying given theres literally no reason it should have changed, and nothing in my privacy settings has been selected to make it so. Ive filed a help request and heard nothing back. Please, please , stop having much loved features randomly become unavailable :("
"Hacked Account. My account has been hacked since July, Ive request support and absolutely nothing has happened. The support team might as well not even be a thing, because they responded 2 months later after I sent well over 50 requests to get my account back and didnt help me at all. This account has pictures of me, and much more. It doesnt make much sense to be the point of a support team, that doesnt help at all? Ive been continually trying to get this account back, but now there is a glitch in the request support page, where my keyboard will glitch and will not let me press the Request Support button and Im just on the last straw of what to do"
"App needs to be evaluated and fixed. Im reporting that when I click on privacy blocked accounts more than half the accounts Ive blocked are not showing up in my list, but when I search for these accounts they show up and they say unblock user which means theyre blocked but I thought when you block a user they stay in your block list and you cannot see them in a search result and why when I click access data see blocked accounts all the accounts appear in that list but not the other one where I can see their profiles in the main list its strange and there has to be a glitch/bug that needs to be fixed immediately this has never happened to me before since the last update"
TERRIBLE UPDATE. No one cares about the shopping feature. Put the likes back on the bottom. Stop tracking our eye movements and selling our data. At the very least you could fix the algorithm. This app is going downhill FAST
I dislike this app so much. I wish I was able to give this a 0 star rating. I cant access my account and my backup account and it had just randomly logged me off of both. As soon as I posted a picture of the things I was selling it immediately gave me a security code. They should fix it where you can change the email Due to the fact my email has changed so there for I cannot access my account Cant find help anywhere and nothing I found has helped me in the slightest amount
Despicable. Asking now for birthday another data point to collect and sell
Old posts. I updated the software and app and its still not showing posts in chronological order. Im seeing posts from data again first still. Its so annoying
"Cant access my account. When I downloaded the app, I tried to login and it wouldnt let me"
Secure my account problems. Its telling me to secure my account by requesting help to log in? I cant access my account or replace it with a new one
"BrickArtist119.

"Its lovely, BUT. Hey, insta I love your app a lot; I go on it probably more than I should, tbh. However, I have a teensy tiny problem My notifications do not work Mind you, I have turned on my push notifications on the app and made sure to allow full access to notifications on my phone. This can be a little bothersome whenever Im DMing someone and simply forget to message them back because I went out of the app and I didnt get any notifications. Like...any My accounts are @Lizzy_for_ya, @vocal_cookie_, @li.zzy.d, and @ollie_da_chiweenie. Neither of them have notifications Please try fixing as soon as possible Thank you"
give me my music back. i changed from a business to a personal account but i still dont have access to copyright music... give it back losers
Cater to hackers. Received zero help reclaiming my account that was hacked and stolen
"Some bugs problems. The app is great but lately Ive been dealing with some bugs you could say. My wifi is good and my data too but when I watch videos on the explore they cut half way and when I rewatch them they cut a little less. Like first I thought because of the WiFi but I really dont think that is. It will just stop, like no loading or nothing it just freezes. Also I dont think it could be the phone either but I dont think the phone and the app has nothing to do with it, but I updated Instagram recently. Well thats it, Im not sure if you guys read the reviews but I hope its just a temporary bug or if its a bug. Thanks"
moving notifications was the wrong move. moving notifications to the top by dms is not practical at all. i cant access them while im on my profile and now i dont get to see how many comments/likes i missed while i was off the app. i dont want to have to scroll through. no one uses shops please reverse this
The update isnt working. I cant share stories at all anymore and I have a personal and business account and no two accounts are working even remotely the same
I cant do attachments. I can attach anything in my histories with my personal account or my shopping account and it is very important for me
"worked wonderful for years. not showing me notifs now. i've been on this app for well over three years, and i've never had an issue with notifications. i've checked every setting i can think of, and for some reason, it refuses to give me any notification other than the badges. no sound, no banners, nothing even on the lock screen. otherwise okay"
"No D/L option. Cant save data from IG, no option available"
"Hacked. After reporting someone hacked my account, how long does it take to get it removed?"
The App is acting crazy. I got a new iPhone 13 Pro Max. The App will not allow me to log in. I have reset my password and I can access my instagram on the internet but not in the app. What can I do to resolve this issue. Thanks
"Playback speed. Aside from the fact that you sell a ton of my data, you dont have a setting to increase playback speed for igtvs or regular videos nonetheless. Many other platforms have this simple feature that goes a long way. I dont have time to listen to people talk slow all day, please give us an increase playback speed setting"
"Not getting Notifications again. From September 2020 to March 2021 I did not receive notifications. Apple again and again said it was not them, I even switched from the 7 to the 12 in December 2020 and it made no difference. The notifications magically turned on one day after my like 5th review here. The notifications are as of today not working again. I posted something and I am not getting notifications about the likes on that post. I also am not getting any notifications for stories or posts that I have on for certain accounts. I am also not getting DM notifications anymore. All as of today. Ive tried deleting and redownloading the app but of course it will not work. Instagram engineers, please fix this. Abs while youre at it please get product looped in here so they can talk to customers affecting this and collect data on it so it doesnt happen again. I will go insane if this happens to me for months into end again. Thanks"
"No more Music feature in IG -STORY. So upsetting because I used the music feature in just about every IG Story I would make and it completely disappeared after I updated.  I deleted the app, updated the app entirely once again,  switched from Business account to Personal and yet still nothing at all.  Help?"
Cellular Data. For weeks now the app does not work when connected to cellular data
My vídeos. My videos lag every time I want to play my personal videos  why?? Its not my service neither
"Problemas con mi cuenta. No puedo usar ciertas funciones con mi usuario de Instagram. Probé con otras cuentas, desinstalé y volví a instalar la app de nuevo pero no funciona. Es solo mi cuenta personal que tiene este problema porque las demás funcionan con normalidad en mi teléfono. Me gustaría corregir ese error"
"Blackouts Arent Cool. What will it take to fix this issue: Everytime I hit my personal profile icon, it goes black. Ive uninstalled/installed the app, Ive restarted my phone &amp; the app/phone has all been recently updated. Ive written numerous emails, as well as gone to the actual URL site and reported the bug. Whats causing this and how will this be fixed? Its rather annoying"
"I get no notifications. Turned notifications on all of BTS' personal accounts and I have not gotten any of them so far, but I get notifications from other accounts who I have their notifications turned. Im sick and tired from not receiving their notifications"
Account Disabled for no reason. I recently got my account disabled for impersonating someone when its my personal account with pictures of me and when I go to fill out the form it say that my account URL doesnt exist so I cant fill up the form to get my account back
new update isnt good. i like the app but why did they put notifications all the way up there
"Hacked. App is amazing for exploring the world and keeping up with friends and family. But if your account gets hacked feels like theres nothing you can really do. Someone hacked my account and changed all my info to attempt to log in but theres nothing that can be done, and despite how many people try to help and report the account nothing seems to come of it"
"New update issues - connectivity. When I try to upload a new video, it says it cannot because the connection is bad but there is nothing wrong with my connection as I can use the internet on other apps. Tried both WiFi and mobile data"
Horrible data service. I cant load anything. It will work for a short while and then everything starts to slow down
Difficult to navigate and edit posts. Still learning Wish I had a tutorial video? I wish I could edit my comments and stories and personal postsI figured out how to privately share somebody elses post but not having to share it on my own page Blah blah blah
"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE?? IN 2020 STILL. When I press tell us nothing happens, it just dismisses the pop up, also why is that I can put a link to SoundCloud the website in my bio theres no problem, but when I link to my personal SoundCloud page it keeps getting rejected, the hypocrisy and favoritism is uncanny, I see that you allow verified users to use link tree but you refuse to allow my link, why? Is it because I dont have a vast enough following? Youll regret doing this to me, believe me"
"Videos and new posts will not load. Videos and new posts will not load even after un/installing the app, coming off of save data mode and clearing my cache"
"Text Link not working  = lost account. I went to scroll through Instagram and had a window jump up asking me to reset my password so I followed the link. The window it brought me into asked me to send a verification code. I received a text message with link to reset my password, unfortunately this link only brought me right back to the verification code window. I gave it two days (even after updating the application) and attempted it again with the same result. I have also reached out to Instagram on multiple platforms. This saddens me because its my personal business page. Hopefully the issue with get resolved soon or some response from Instagram at the very least"
Stop. Stop with the bs ads Every time I look something up online its like Im being spied on and its very uncomfortable No one wants to see ads every 2-3 post
"Long Gone. Long gone are the days of enjoying what used to be a simple app to navigate. The past few new updates have just been one disaster right after another. The shopping plaza was a cheap copout and if I wanted to watch reel like videos I would just close the app and go over to tiktok (oh wait, that&#39;s literally what I do). I am immensely disappointed and have no joy when opening this app anymore. I miss chronological order. I miss not accidentally clicking that stupid shopping plaza because I am trying to check my notifications. This is not one of those &#34;it will take time to get use to&#34; updates - the simple fact is it is inefficient, annoying, and quite frankly not aesthetically pleasing. I am seriously considering closing out my personal accounts because of how dissatisfying this experience is"
Notifications doesnt work correctly. I have being using ig for a really long time but after one of their updates I havent received any notification on my phone I already tried everything and nothing works I need to check the app to see if I have notifications because it doesnt shows me anything at all I checked on settings and everything its active so idk what to do
Cant Use Reels Feature. My account doesnt have the reels feature. I have other business accounts under IG and none of them have that issue just my personal one
"My Delinquent Account. I have an account that Ive barely used and have no way of accessing (I dont use the recovery email address or phone number anymore). I cant access the account to delete it, and even after reporting it, IG has refused to remove the account. Obviously IG has no actual support, so I cant talk to a real person or email anybody to ask them to please remove the account. This needs to be more user friendly. Please stop making it impossible for us to delete our information and accounts that we no longer want on here. 1/10 would recommend"
Change phone and loose your account. Ive changed my phone but because if the 2FA I lost my account. I have no access to my backup codes provider and lost my recovery codes and cannot log in back
"Notifications icon replaced with Shops . I have zero interest in buying products on Instagram, why have you replaced the notifications option with the new Shop icon? Fair enough if there was an option to change it and choose, but apparently you are testing this feature on  select number of users without any way of turning it off. I have multiple accounts, some for business, but this only appears on my personal one... Doubt the review will do anything, but wanted to vent... "
"Unsend + Delete messages. The app is great but somethings are just too complicated to do with no reason, why am I able to unsend a message ( which is great) but not to delete it only for myself. Doesnt make a tiny bit of sense.I enjoy some privacy, and its bad enough that when I unsend something the other person is notified, but I cant delete it just because I dont want to see it or anyone else beside me.Privacy please"
"My account completely crashed. So I tired to make a new account off of my personal for clothing and when I went back to my personal and clicked on the account icon, the whole screen went black and it kept doing that over and over again I uninstalled and restarted and everything nothing work please fix this so I can have a normal working account"
help me pleasee. i need help logging into my account because somebody has used my email but i never verified it? so now i cant even log into MY personal account because i violated community guidelines by using my password to get followers and likes.
Personal account glitch. Im in personal account and I dont have the music I want even tho Im not in a business or creator account
Customer service doesnt seem to care. I have a family account that my husband and I share as well as a personal. The family account said I was under 13 and disabled. Ive been logged out for almost a month. Ive sent in the appeals and done everything they told me to do as far as verification of ID. Still nothing. No contact and they dont seem to care because I know of several people that have had the same issue. The app is fine but customer service is awful. I usually NEVER leave a review but this has been annoying and they need to fix this
Love the App. It has honestly transformed our cabin vacation business.  Incredible
This new update. This new update actually sucks... literally no one uses shopping it was better to access when it was a folder in the discover tab. I like when the likes were beside my profile it was easier to keep track of and easier to move around the app... but other than that reels is stupid no one uses it and when they do there using tiktoks good try but youll never replace tiktok
"Decent. I enjoy sharing and viewing photos. Easy app. However, the auto-play of any and all videos is quite a deterrent. We used to have an option to not use data and turn off the auto-play, but theres no longer an option for that and it keeps me from scrolling and getting on the app. Sometimes I dont want to watch a video, nor have it be the reason my loading slows for a slight second, but there is no option to turn it off"
"new update :(. my personal account has not gotten the new update while my spam has. why is that? please fix this also, i got action blocked on both my accounts for no reason :("
"video quality. i cant share my video with HD or fullHD quality, the program automatically upload video with bad quality,i already changed the setting data usage to high quality upload but a same problem"
"Version 177.0. Since the most recent version 177.0 3 days ago, I can no longer repost any videos to any of the 3 IG pages I own. Everything was working just fine 4 days ago, then, video reposting either thru a repost app or directly thru IG (+), gone. IG keeps sending me a notification when I attempt to repost a video we will attempt again when the connection is better. I have tried on WiFi, off WiFi w/ cellular data, strong cell connection/signal, still doesnt work. This has to be a bug in Ver 177.0. ):"
"Still cant login on the app after about a year. I can login on the app on other phones and on any browser but anytime I try to login on my personal phone, it says ERROR Sorry, theres was a problem with your request. No matter how many emails I send or how many times I try to report a problem, Im not given a single response"
bug:((. I cannot share posts to my story after this recent update i have been unable to share posts to my story not only my own posts but others posts too. at first i thought it was someones privacy settings but it isnt an option at all on any posts:((((
"Can no longer share posts to my story. On my personal account I can no longer share posts to my story, can only send directly to individuals. But on my other account I can? How can this be fixed ?"
IM NOT GETTING THE UPDATE. To whom it may concern:I was recently informed about a new insta update. It involved the ability to change the heart reaction (on DMs) to another emoji. I am frantically searching around on how to do this. It has come to my attention that I have to update the app but no update is available at this time. This is an issue that is really personal and important to me and I need someone to do something about this. Kind regards

"Music Sticker. My music sticker wont even show up anymore after switching to a personal account. When I had a business account, a bunch of random songs popped up instead of the usual song library. Please fix this problem or I might as well delete the app"
Locations no longer allow for my personal creation that I've been using. Wish I could flip and mirror the GIFS like we used to be able to do
"Bug. Currently a bug where you cant save photos received as DM because it needs camera roll permissions, even though these are enabled in privacy settings. iPhone 8 - iOS 13.3.1"
"Ive never left a review but I HAD to for this. Your update with the shopping tab is completely disgusting and ridiculous. In other words IT COMPLETELY BLOWS I will 100 percent jump ship if you keep this update, get rid of the shopping tab and put the photo upload button back. This update is horrible and speaks volumes about what a nasty sellout youve become as a brand and it makes me feel unsafe as a loyal customer about how much of my personal information you are sharing. "
Too many issues. I have two businesses and a personal account. Theres always some kind of issue with this program because it doesnt seem to be able to recognize who I am. Sometimes it takes away my ability to post or blocks my account or just removes the account access. Theres no one to talk to for help. Frustrating
"New update. I love the new update, but It seems I cant experience the new features on my main account but when I went to go to my second and third account theyre all updated. Other people are experiencing this glitch and I hope it gets fixed soon as its quite frustrating that I have to log into those accounts to see the new features. And for some reason on my main account I cant edit my personal information"

New glitch. I cant change my tags in privacy settings the app just freezes and crashes plz fix
privacy issues. clear search history doesn't work. blocked accounts come up in search which doesn't make any sense
"Learn Your Role, IG. Became unbearable after Covid.  Way too pushy with all the vaccine nonsense, and as time goes on I become increasingly concerned how these weasels were monitoring my data.  Twas a shame, enjoyed using IG for years but they turned into cuckolds and lost my trust"
Cant hide profile category. I switched my profile back to personal account and it still says blogger
Got hacked and wont help. Ive had my account for over 7 years and someone hacked it last Monday (2/07/2022) and I reported it and said I would be contacted within 2 to 3 business days and they NEVER messaged me about anything and they (the hackers) have FULL access to my account now and I cant change anything and theres no point of making a new account after having mine for so long and am not getting help to get it back
Music feature still not working in Personal account. Currently not working after followed all procedure to bring it back
Account. My account was hacked/disabled and Im unable to recover it. I used the help form and tried submitting the questions but its not allowing me to do so. Its been disabled for two weeks now. Please reach out to assist thank you
Reels. Why is it that Im able to create 60sec reels on one of my accounts and only 30sec reels on my other account and theyre both linked together as personal and business account ?

Im dissapointed. You guys disabled my personal account @GotBars510 for no reason
"Cant publish videos - iPhone SE. As of the most recent update, version 177.0, I cant post videos on the iPhone SE (1st gen). Ive seen other users post on Twitter that they cant publish videos either. I immediately get an error at the top of my home feed saying well post the video when theres a better connection even though Im connected to my phone service which is paid on time so there shouldnt be an issue with data. The issue is in the Instagram software after the newer update. Please fix this bug as posting videos is just as important as posting pictures on Instagram. Thank you"
New updates are horrible. Dont update or even download this app. New updates just want to sell you stuff while pumping more ads down your throat
Problem. I can not go in to my personal page an cannot see my post
"Notifications. My notifications arent working.Ive restarted my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app, looked at my pushed notifications, used the help centre and logged out of my account than logged back  in. I dont know what else to do"

"Notifications & Deleting Conversations. Ive been having the same problem for a month where I do not receive notifications at ALL. It is really annoying because this is where I contact most of my friends and I dont see a notification for like another 4-5 hours. If I delete a conversation, it also shows back up as if never deleted. Please fix this Im tired of this"
"Direct Messages. The direct messages need to be policed a little heavier, I deleted all of the spam messages I receive less than a week ago, and I already have 16 again. My page is private, how are these scammers messaging me? Its a trivial but irritating issue. Can this be looked into?"
"The app is good. The app is good but i want to know if i can log into my account that is linked with my personal. I dont have access to the email anymore and theres no there way for me to log in. There are personal photos there that i would like back. Is the account able to be logged into again? Thanks, Aileen Flores"
"Wrongful Deactivation. the other morning I woke up and  My account was flagged and deactivated for pretending to be another person? This is absurd because this is my photography page. Theres no way that I could have been impersonating someone else. Furthermore, this is my personal page that I use for business and this is a severe inconvenience for my and my business opportunities. Please if theres any way I can regain access into my account. I started this account over 7 years ago. I hate to lose it like this. Please reconsider this deactivation"
"Paedophiles can send your childs private account messages. Limit who can dm who. Strangers should not be allowed to roam free and message private accounts they dont follow. Its not hard to code this feature in. You need to do better, rather than respond with cookie-cutter directions to your substandard privacy guide terms"
Suggested followers. Can you all consider taking the random people off our time lines....its like we are being force to view people we dont want to see or follow...that should remain on the explore page not our personal time line

"Add yours sticker not working. The add yours sticker does not work on my main and oldest account Ive reset my phone, Ive deleted and redownloaded the application, Ive changed my account from personal to business and still nothing brings it back It worked one time and now its not available to add to my stories nor can I click on the add yours in others peoples stories to add to.

Please please please fix this, I shouldnt have to make a whole new account that works just fine when Ive had mine since 2014. Please help, I love this feature"
Good app. Very good and fun app however my account got hacked and I want them to remove the account permanently but its very hard to get in touch with them if they ban all the hackers and stuff like that then I will be happy but if anyone has ever got in contact with them pls lmk how you did that because I have sent them loads of emails and all I want is a simple request and that is to remove my account because I have personal posts thank you
"Notification wont load, spam, & bots. Im having a problem with my Notification Center where it will show me on the home icon theres something there but when I go to the Notification Center it says couldnt load? And its been like this for days. Also, the spam, bots, and fake pages on this app is ridiculous"
"One account wont update. I have two IG accounts (business and personal). One of my accounts hasnt had new features in two years, while the other is constantly updated"
Blue labile. I asked many time for account verification and I didnt get a clear feedback why did they refuse it
Annoyed. MY STORY FONTS WON&#39;T UPDATE I have 2 accounts: personal &amp; business. The business one has all the updates but my personal won&#39;t update. IG never responds to my requests to fix the problem. I&#39;m so annoyed What can I do? I have the latest version of the app and I do have the updates and fonts on my business account on the same phone
Reposting stories/posts. I have two accounts. A private spam account threat can REPOST OTHER PEOPLES POSTS TO MY SOTRIES BUT MY MAIN ACCOUNT CANT its getting really annoying and it was like this for a while
"This is Not a review. I figured I would reach out on here and see if I get an answer. So for 2 or three weeks now I have not been able to sign onto my main account. The first time I reported a sign in problem I got an email with the steps to recover it. I followed the steps and havent heard anything back. I have done the recover/ reset password option several times since. I know that after inactivity accounts can be deleted but that is after a warning email according to Instagram help center. Its really frustrating that I cant reset my password to get back in my account, especially since I still get emails for that account to check out this or that. I dont know if I have the energy or desire to start a personal page all over again on this platform so figuring this out would be nice. Can someone from the company please respond???"
"I have this weird glitch with my Instagram music. So for at least a week now my Instagram music has just..broke. its kinda hard to describe but I&#39;ll give it a shot. Basically, My Instagram music has only bald men, Russian people, k-pop and weird background music. It doesn&#39;t come up with any popular artists that it would of before this all happened. I have searched up nirvana, baby shark, Melanie Martinez, babooshka and many other songs and it just comes up with no results found as if it doesn&#39;t even exist.  The thing I think is weird is that 1. in the search suggestions it comes up with songs but they don&#39;t apparently exist 2. This type of music is something I have never listened to or seen in my entire life 3. I don&#39;t listen to music that could be in the same genre as these random songs. I have attempted to redownload Instagram around 4 times now? But it had no effect. My friend also thought that it could be because of copyright since I had a business account, I became a personal account and it still didn&#39;t work.  Also i haven&#39;t heard of anyone else experiencing this sort of glitch so when i google stuff its kinda a dead end And its just hard to put into words.This glitch is really been bugging me because i like putting music on my stories because it just adds an element to pictures or just helps me kinda secretly announce a mood I&#39;m in. Im completely open to any ideas you guys have, i just really want to fix this"

Buggy. 1.) Cant switch back from professional account to personal. 2.) Hide creator category on profile doesnt work. 3.) When on a persons following tab your mutual followings doesnt show up first
Subscription. I cant download the app because it has my billing information saved for some fraud subscription . Cant add the app or remove my card until it successfully breached my bank
Bug: Pin stuff to stories isnt working. Cant pin text to stories Also cant share posts to stories from a personal account
"Notifications. The notifications refuse to work despite them being on in both the in-app settings and phone settings. Deleted and reinstalled, still had the issue. Extremely annoying"
Move clips feature in Reels is gone. I would love to give Instagram a 5 but I cant unless I figure out why my ability to reorder clips in Reels continues to be inaccessible in my additional account for my blog. The feature is still accessible in my original personal account but the feature is missing I my second account. Its frustrating to load a bunch of clips and not be able to rearrange the order. Ive tried to get help on this issue and have been unsuccessful
add to story. my add post to story button has never worked on my personal ig and its extremely frustrating because theres no way to fix it
Forced Birthday. Wont let u log on unless you divulge personal information
"Fonts. Though it is a personal opinion, I dislike how the font sizes of each word change depending on the spacing. Other than that inconvenience, it is a great app"
"my music isnt working??. Apparently i cannot use the music on this app anymore due to the fact i have a business account, however i do not actually run a business, it was purely for the aesthetic on my profile. I keep reporting this issue as i would like to have back the music feature for my account (which is personal)"
No internet. Every time I tap on the app it tells me no internet. Unusable since last update. Connect to wifi or mobile data still doesnt work
Not working. The I cant access my email or phone number option isnt working
You guys are failing me. I sent you guys an email and made a report and left a voicemail and you guys havent responded BACK. My acct was hacked and thanx you guy I had to make a new acct and lost alllllllllllll my personal picture.  Please get back to me
New update - not good. Putting the shopping button where the like button was... is the worst. And now switching between personal and business accounts happens by mistake- please fix. Notifications barely work anymore
"Not happy with update. Wish i never updated the app, my notifications dosent update me anymore. It switches between my personal and business account when I attempt to view my home page which is annoying.I am no longer able to align my photos I post, so it looks very zoomed in when I post a picture, compared to my previous photos where I was able to see the whole pic. I also have to constantly refresh my page, just to see the updates. Preferred the old version compared to this new one"
"Im starting to hate it. This stuff is making me mad , I cant play every time I log in it say cant refresh screen , and I got WiFi and data and service"
"Log in problem. While Im on WiFi the app lets me log in just fine with no issues at all, but when Im not at home and Im just using my cellular data the app keeps telling me there is a network problem. Then I uninstall the app and install it again and it works just fine with the cellular data but only for a while before it goes back to giving the log in error. I dont know if its just my app or something in the settings but Ive checked everywhere and everything is fine. ITS ANNOYING"
"Used to be 5 stars. Was a 5 star app until it glitched (across multiple devices, and yes I have done the troubled shooting). I have reported my problems but no contact back or ticket number tells me they would rather me create a new account than fix the established on I already have. Basically I tried to change from a personal account to a professional account and it glitched out and left me with the following issues:- cannot change type of account from personal.- activity log will only display when i am tagged. No likes, other comments, follows, or views.- push notifications will not come through, despite all notification settings on device and in-app are set to on.Really wish I could get a response"
Tee. I Definitely Luv The New Updates U Guys Did Over The Last Few Months Myself Definitely Keep Em Coming Unlike Other People That Has Complained About The Updates Dont Mind Them At All Me Personal I Dont Understand Y They Would Hate The Updates U Guys Provide For Us Users But Anyway I Definitely Luv &amp; Appreciate It Myself 
Why I give this a one star. When Ever I try to login to my personal account it says sorry we couldnt log you in
Fix it. um yea idk whats going on but yall beed to fix it. I have post notifications on for peothe the notifications dont come to my phone till HOURS later. literally and yall need to put the post picture button back at the bottom like yall doing way too much
"Notifications dont go away. Both my personal and business account constantly  have notifications or message alerts. I did not have any messages, and the notification saying I have one wont go away. And none of the notifications go away when I click them so I always have 20+ notifications all the time"
"No Way to Help You Recover Hacked Account. Both my email and phone number was changed on my account by a hacker. There is no easy way for a user to report the hack and recover the account. All the solutions offered does not work for me due to the nature of how my account was taken over. Im furious that IG: why is there no option to report an account for being hacked? They have tons of users, this happens a lot, and they dont even have it as an option. Why? Because it doesnt effect their profit margins, and would be more work to take care of the problem? They cant hire a few more people?"
Cant download. I cant even download the appBc Apple keep saying I need my credit information on here
Two accounts. I have my personal account and then my business account and I cant seem to figure out why I cant get the same music choices as I do on my personal for my business. Ill go to search music and it never allows me to pick a song but when I use my personal account no issues. My options for music on my business account are very limited and half time I dont even know the artist. How can I get the same music for my business account?
"Glitchy. My account has been terrible since I switched from a personal account to a business account. It glitches all the time, I can not get it to sync with my FB and now I cant get into it all. I officially hate this ap"
"i got logged out for no reason ??. it says thanks for providing your info We&#39;ll review your info and if we can confirm it, you&#39;ll be able to access your account within approximately 24 hours. well its been much longer than 24 hours and I STILL cant log in fix this"
Doesnt let me make my account a business account. Whenever i try to make my personal account a business account it doesnt let me. It keeps saying You have reached the limit for the number of businesses you can create at a time. but i have no other business accounts. Please fix this asap
"Story posts. My Add post to story function completely disappeared on June 7th 2019 and has been since then. I cannot even share my own personal posts to my story. I have tried refreshing the app, turning my phone off and on, updating the app, logging in and out, and even updating my phone software, to no avail. I had the function prior, so I do not understand why I would lose it. This appears to be a widespread problem to other users as well, and would appreciate it being addressed or some feedback as to why this is happening. As a content creator, this inability to share even my own posts onto my story is detrimental, as it makes me unable to give more exposure to my work. I would appreciate some action or update to be done to fix this problem not just for myself, but for other creators and businesses that may have this problem"
Great except one thing. I have had aloe of different accounts and stuff and they show up because I have a personal account and a business account but they I got to the area where you can switch your accounts it shows all of the old accounts I have had. And Im POSITIVE that i deleted the accounts permanently So if yall could fix it that would be really nice :)
5 stars. This is the greatest app evet you can watch videos an tex people this is the greatest ap download it
"genuinely awful. they deleted my account for NO reason, i was messaging my friends in our groupchat, and then my app crashed, and when i reloaded it, it said there was suspicious activity and i was logged out. they said i had 30 days to follow to steps to get my account back and stop it from being disabled, but they just straight up deleted my account instantly? i dont know about any unusual activity anywayidk if i couldve been hacked or what but this is the second time ive lost access to an account for nothing"
FaceTiming is not working. Ive recently tried to FaceTime and it says call failed to connect.. my WiFi and data is working and it wont work for my friends and family.. I was wondering if you could get back to me. Other than that your app is very good
"Worst Customer Servics. Hello,I\'ve been trying to get in contact with your support team for about 5 days now in regards to my account. I have contacted you through the proper channels first and even submitted a request/verified myself through a selfie and have gotten nothing back. I have done that twice now and will submit a 3rd request today.My account was only used for personal purposes and I\'ve never violated the terms of use or service so it is unclear to me why my account would ever be disabled, especially without notice. I have a lot of photos and friends that I can only keep in contact with through the accounts so I would very much like access to it returned back to me. At least, get back to me and explain why it was necessary to disable my account in the first place so we can discuss that. I think its ridiculous that I would have to go to these lengths to get in contact with someone"
"Add yours sticker not working. The add yours sticker does not work on my main and oldest account Ive reset my phone, Ive deleted and redownloaded the application, Ive changed my account from personal to business and still nothing brings it back It worked one time and now its not available to add to my stories nor can I click on the add yours in others peoples stories to add to.

Please please please fix this, I shouldnt have to make a whole new account that works just fine when Ive had mine since 2014. Please help"
annoying update . I dont like this new update because you wont know if the other person has vanish mode on and I dont think its good to have the screenshot notification too I dont see the point of vanish mode it stupid in my opinion I think people should have their privacy and not be scared to say certain stuff and not knowing that the other person can take a screenshot or use vanish mode
No songs for stories. So rubbish  Why would you update it to hardly any actual music ? Awful range of songs.  No point in even having the music feature on stores if you cant even add songs personal to you. Worst ever
My captions key getting deleted. Something so simple but yet no information on how to rectify it
"Pics to art and heart. Personal to perused and posted to share with family and friends to provide a message to envoke or joke or poke at whatever said or shown.

"I got Hacked and IG wont give me my account back. I had been using IG for many years now. I had countless meaningful memories on my account. One day I fell for a DM from a friend whose account had been hacked. Within seconds I had lost all access to my account. Because this happened during work hours I didnt realize until after work that IG had sent me an email that could have helped me possibly save my account. By the time I pressed the revert action  option, the link had expired and the hacker had changed all of my information to theirs. Ive been trying for a week now to proof my identity through a selfie video that IG requests from me, however, I keep getting denied Ive lost hope of ever recovering my account. I used to love IG, but their security system is truly disappointing. Now the hacker has successfully hacked many of my followers despite the multiple reports being made to the account and my MULTIPLE attempts to recover my account. I wish there was a better system in place. This is a total invasion of my privacy and its placing so many others at risk. I feel sick knowing that a total stranger has complete access to my account and is impersonating me online. :( wish Ig would help me and others in my situation"
Too difficult to post.  And someone hacked my identity. Not really
"Thank you. Hello,I would like to verify my account. What are the steps to become verified?  If you need me to help you with any beta data testing or filling out any reviews Im happy to help you with that. I I appreciate this app as it allows me to connect with people all over the world. but would like to become verified if possible. I appreciate your time and helpThanks,Gregorio Martinez Jr253) 332-1500"
"updates. so, ive updated the app. but i cant do all the new update features like pinning, etc. on any other account rather than my personal???"
"Music. I have two accounts, my personal account and an account for different pictures. But however I cannot post music on my personal account but everyone else can? Its stupid how I cant post music"
"Personal Account made into a Business Account magically. Somehow my personal account has been made into a business account without my doing. I have a completely separate profile for my business so this was completely unnecessary And unfortunately each time that I try to switch it to a business account I am given an error and that it is unable to switch back to a personal account. Sadly, I am not a huge account yet so no one from Instagram or their team has tried to fix this for me"
"Last update wont work with cellular. This latest revision (v230) does not work at all with 5G data, only works for me with wi-fi. Turns out that somehow cellular data was turned off for IG only in my settings. Dont you  do any testing before shipping a new release?"
Glitchy. Ever since Instagram added reels its becoming increasingly difficulty to use the feature. I prefer to make my reals in advance and then post on later date to avoid the crunch of editing. I have had to re-create the same real several times because the app is so glitchy and will not save my data or I have to force close and delete the app because it just wont work at all. The editing tool for reals is extremely horrible. It has a lot of bugs in when I finally can post a real the sound has been unsynchronized in someway not at all what I edit it to
"Dissatisfied. My page has been hacked all of your tips information is useless if you dont have the password and the person who hacked my page has also changed the phone number. So l cant delete/change password or anything.  No way to get assistance, very frustrating"
"IG REELS KEEP DELETING MY CAPTION. I dont know why or whats happening but nothing is helping. Ive logged out, deleted the data, deleted and redox loaded the app. It REGULARLY posts my reels with no caption. Even though I typed one out for it. It is so frustrating Maybe 1/10 times it will actually post it all. Wth?"
Date miners. Stealing my data
Nothing will load and its not a network problem. At first I thought I got hacked but I logged in through the browser but it works fine the app itself wont work at all my account isnt loading I cant access any posts without saying to check internet Ive reinstalled it and nothing Happens
"No connection. WILL NOT work on WiFi despite having top notch internet. Only loads on data. Comments mostly, posts sometimes"
"HACKED. MY ACCOUNT IS HACKED AND LITERALLY NOTHING ON UR WEBSITE HELPS GETTING IT BACK AT ALL, THERES NO ONE TO CONTACT EITHER I DONT UNDERSTAND"
Hacked with no help. Someone was able to hack my original account and change my email and phone number. Posting money scams. Absolutely no way of contacting meta or Insta. No wonder why they are losing money on shares
"wont allow me to update messaging. this app is not allowing me the feature to update messaging or use cross-app messaging. i have updated the app, deleted it and then re-downoaded it, and logged out and logged back in and i am still unable to access this feature. this is VERY frustrating i dont understand why most other users can have a feature that i cannot please fix"
"Horrible. My account has been hacked, they changed the phone number and email...when I tried to use the emails I got because they were hacking it did nothing it just said link is invalid now"
"Account disabled for no reason. My personal account was wrongfully disabled, and its been a couple days since I tried appealing it, yet I still have not gotten a response. Shameful"
"Not working, no response. Going into the app, I cant access anything at all and even reloading it doesnt do much. I tried resetting my phone, turning it off and on, and reinstalling the app and it doesnt work at all. My WiFi connection is fine and even using data it doesnt do anything. Please help I really love this app so much and I met some of my friends on there"
"Music isnt working?. Even though i switched back to a personal account, the music still wont give me usual artists like doja cat, and ariana grande. Ive deleted it and redownloaded it but it wont work. Its annoying because i cant post music on my story anymore. Fix this please instagram"

"Account hacked. My account has been hacked and blocked me they changed my info so I cant log back in, they have been messaging my friends to send their bank details @halle_maclean"
"Very displeased. I deactivated my account for personal reasons. I went in to activate and was notified that I would have to receive a SMS code since my device was recognized. I decided to contact the support team and they emailed me saying my account had been disabled by them. I replied and told them it was NOT disabled, I had deactivated on my own accord. I then received an email requesting that i send a photo of myself, holding up a piece of paper including my full name, user name, & code they provided to me. I replied with the information the next day and i have yet to hear anything or gain access into my account.For 4 days now, I have not received one SMS code or email from the support team.. i have reached out multiple times since then and i feel i am being purposely ignored. This needs to be resolved soon, this is my account I understand safety features to prevent an account from being hacked but this is extreme....One star is way too nice...

"Help. I cant get access to new update feature like changing chat themes and reacting to messages with emojis, I have try every method there is such as updating, clearing data, uninstalling. Pls fix my account"
Recommendations on disabling accounts. My page has been disabled mistakenly.  This disabling accounts thing is getting out of hand. Can yall make a different punishment like suspending accounts for days when not following guidelines because I had really important information and a lot of personal things I need on that account. I have had this account for about 3 or 4 years and I have never experienced this kind of punishment before. So I highly recommend yall suspending accounts ( not being able to log in your account temporarily)  for 1 week if they dont follow guidelines instead of permanently disabling an account
"New update not great. The new update/format is subpar. If you have multiple accounts, it is more cumbersome  to switch between accounts (ex. personal and business)"

Las nuevas actualizaciones de instagram. Las nuevas actualizaciones de Instagram son realmente malos (horribles)Más que ahora bloquean las cuentas muy frecuentemente por cualquier pequeña cosaComo por seguir a más de 20 gente o por dar más de 20 like o por ver otras cuentas Ami en lo personal Instagram me bloquea la cuenta todos los días no hay un día que no me lo bloquen aun que yo espere 7 días sin usarlos igual pasa lo mismoEn palabras cortas espero 7 días para que todo esté bien y que pueda usar mi cuenta normal Pero eso no sirve para nada son días perdido Realmente Ami me gustaba mucho más el Instagram del comienzo del 2019 las actualizaciones eran mucho mejor Y no habían tantos fallos como ahora

Im reporting that when I click on privacy blocked accounts more than half the accounts Ive blocked are not showing up in my list, but when I search for these accounts they show up and they say unblock user which means theyre blocked but I thought when you block a user they stay in your block list and you cannot see them in a search result and why when I click access data see blocked accounts all the accounts appear in that list but not the other one where I can see their profiles in the main list its strange and there has to be a glitch/bug that needs to be fixed immediately and to add also when I block more people the list wont show me the full amount of accounts Ive blocked I just updated the app today and still that did not fix the issue"
"Account recovery is broken. Currently the method to recover a hacked account is broken, and goes through a loop that never actually gets to the point where you can send info to the support department.Note sent to Apple to remove from App Store until account recovery system is fixed"

Ive uninstalled and reinstalled, logged out and logged back in, offloaded the app, tried it on my laptop and none of that worked at all. I can comment on posts, make posts and stories and i can @ people in my stories and posts and receive messages and message notifications as well but every time i try to open a DM im stuck with an endless loading screen.

Does not work with 2g or less. This app does not work with 2g connection or low-speed connection. The Use less Data option does NOT work well or does NOT save data. You should create a Lite version or I just have to delete the app and use the Web version from safari
"Music. My music has been glitching the last couple weeks. Its been showing me old music that Ive never heard of. Like kpop and old music from the 70s , and autobiographys . I reinstalled Instagram many times no results. I also changed my account to a personal blog because I thought it might have been due to copy right and it still hasnt worked. Please fix this problem"
"App isnt working, maybe its a sign for me to stop using insta . Cant post at the moment telling me connection issues, and it wont let make carousel posts. Also if you changed the need to crop an image square if its not the first image in a carousel, thatd be incredible"
"Cant repost a share on stories. On my personal account, the option &#34;Add post to your story&#34; (when I hit the little airplane icon), doesn&#39;t appear. It doesn&#39;t matter if the person who posted it has a public profile, in fact, I have another account (a business one) where I don&#39;t have that issue. I&#39;ve checked configurations up and down, looked everywhere on the internet and couldn&#39;t find any solution.I cant even add my own post to a story :(Please help"
"Why do I not have reels still ????. I have updated this app with every update for months as well as updated my phone. Im an avid user and planned to keep using to expand my business and personal profile ... however, I dont have reels and I really want to use them for promo work and even personal fun ... what is it gonna take to get them?"
"Messages dont work. Theres a bug that keeps me from being able to see my direct messages. It was working fine for years and then all of sudden it stopped working. Reported it several times and nothing has been done havent even gotten a response. I have multiple accounts; business, personal, and a funny one for my dog. My personal account cant receive or send messages because its been sticking buffering a black screen for over 6 months"
Share posts feature not working. I have 2 accounts (one personal &amp; one work) and my personal account will not bring up the option to share someone elses post to my story.   My work account works fine
"Its been a great social platform but. I have two different accounts, one for my art and personal life. Im very active on both and love posting. My complaint for this year, is that the app has been crashing like crazy. It happens all the time Ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared storage on my phone and app, upgraded the app and my phone, even gone to the Apple store. Really nothing works, unless I get a new phone, whichs way more expensive than it needs to be"
"Great but -. Theres a few glitches. I love posting stories but sometimes the stickers dont move when theyre supposed to. Also, my business acct and personal are not equally updated. And I cant see some reposted shares in my inbox. It will say something along the lines of  must get the updated version when Ive already updated Otherwise. Love IG"
Add Post to Story. Please fix Add Post to Story on my personal account (@martinvolinsky). Its been over a year of communicating the issue and no solution. Please fix since its a very useful and important feature for brand growth
"New update saves low res photos. The new version compresses the edited photos it saves on my iPhone. I realize it would compress them on the Instagram app/site for others to see (and to reduce data from MILLIONS of users and even more data), but it used to save a full resolution version with any filters or edits I would make on my phone. Now I have to keep two versions of every photo: original unedited and compressed/pixelated/low res version with edits/filters. I didnt notice until I zoomed in to text and it was no longer sharp (even though I used the sharpen edit tool).I hope you fix this"
"Error logging into account. My account went blank while refreshing not allowing me to like or refresh or see any of my posts, my followers and following gone. I decided to log out and reset my password and log in. Now i cannot log back in and all i get is error on the screen. I thought this meant my account must be reported or removed but when my friends search up my username i am still there with all the data. What is going on"
Cant access and I dont know why. The app doesnt work for me anymore and I cant get any support as too why I cant log on the app at all I just get an error message
the update is terrible. the developers refuse to listen to the users and what they want instead made the entire app revolve around businesses. not what it used to be
Blank screen when switching between profiles. Screen keeps blanking out when I switch between personal and business profiles. Never had this happen before so its probably the new update and its getting VERY annoying Ive tried everything to fix it
Yay. Hey so I love this app I use it 24/7 and my only complaint is that they should have a timer on photos so we can take pictures. Thx 
"stories dont work. so when i go to my story and swipe to create and select multiple, i select the pictures and try to create it but it wont let me use all of the photos. WHATS THE POINT OF LETTING YOU SELECT MULTIPLE IF YOU CANT USE ALL OF THE PHOTOS??????"
"Wont refresh. Before the recent update, I was to scroll for hours. Now, I cant see the first three photos without it saying error refreshing or cant refresh feed IT SO ANNOYING And Ive tried everything from turning data on and off, turning my phone completely off, and then deleting the app and reloading it, but it still wont work. If it werent for them slowing the app down so that I was forced to update it, I wouldnt be in this situation to begin with"
So much fun. Just love IG. Both my dogs and my personal account. Ive met a lot of new friends around the world. Some amazing people Thank you

"30 second reels available on a 0 follower account but not on a 800k?. I thought 30 second reels would have been standard for ALL accounts yet Ive been waiting months for 30 second reels to be available on my main page just like the feature is available on all my other pages (including 0 follower finstas) but Ive yet to be able to post a simple 30 second reel on the account I want this feature most on, what gives? Ive changed the type of account, privacy, uninstalled reinstalled, VPN, using the help section to report the problem, and just anything you can think of. I love Instagram but Im very upset about this situation, please fix this AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"
"App stops working out of nowhere. Whenever I go on instagram it keeps going blank and the app seems to just give up on working after 2 minutes of use. I cant post pictures because it goes blank and turns off.And I also cant post anything on my story because it updates for days and at some point it just deletes itself.Very frustrating, I also deleted and downloaded the app like twice to try and fix it, nothings changed?"
Spam. Your new spam notifications that can&#39;t be turned off further downgrade this junk of an app to below 0 stars
Add yours feature. I would love if you could add my account to your list of everyone else that has that sticker Ive tried deleting the app and upgrading and phone off and on and updates and personal account to biz account and nothing works. Locations also seem to change. Id love and appreciate if unceded territory of the Mikmaq was still an option. Can someone please reply?

"Action blocked for no reason. My personal account @themonster195 has been action blocked for several months now for no good reason. Ive tried many different things, including sending a support request, but had no luck"
"awesome experience. been a long time using this app for personal and business purposes, one word is enaugh and that is just AWESOME.thanks"
"No service at all. My account was randomly deactivated out of the blue (I think it was hacked) and was deactivated. I proceeded to ask IG for an appeal via the app to look into what had happened. A few days later, after verifying my identity, I was told that my account would be once again made active. I was excited to be able to access my account again but instead when I tried to log in it said my account doesnt exist. I have tried so many time to get in contact with someone and couldnt find a contact or any support at all. I would really like someone to contact me ASAP"
"Cant hide likes. Ive seen other friends hide their likes but I cant hide none of my likes, I keep updating the app to hopefully it updates my posts in my privacy settings, but its not working. Can you guys please fix that"

Ahora ya no, no sé a los demás pero a mi en lo personal si me encantaría que volvieran esa opción, de poder volver a ver quien vio nuestras historias después de 24 horas. Ustedes personas de Instagram, deberían que prestar atención a todos los comentarios para mejorar la app. Les pido porfavor que devuelven esa opción. Muchas gracias"
NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I GOT HACKED JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO AND IM TRYING TO GET IN CONTACT WITH SUPPORT BUT IM GETTING THE RUN AROUND DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOUR ACCOUNT ISN'T SAFE EVER

"hacked. It blows my mind that this is a multimillion dollar organization and you provide no technical support for people. my account was hacked and there is no help whatsoever on how to get it back, trying to log back in is impossible when the hacker changes the email and phone number for the account and thats the only email you send the verification code to how do you make it so easy for hackers to steal and keep access of someones account"
I cant log in. It keeps sending me in a loop saying Ive used other apps to gain followers when I literally havent. And I follow the instructions it gives me and it STILL wont let me log in. My review will be 5 stars whenever I can actually access my account
Videos wont play. All other content will load but videos wont play on either WiFi or on data. Deleted and reinstalled the app but nothing has changed. Very disappointed this app usually works really well
"Pictures from Earth. My visual trip resume, To fast track into understanding each other more, a picture tells a thousand words Less blah blah blah Is that good ?A picture can be stamped on the soul"

"personal problem. I lost the ability to repost posts on my story. I had the option before and nothing has changed but I tried posting a post on my story, and I didnt have the option to all of a sudden. This problem for me needs to be fixed. dont know why I dont have the feature anymore"
Wont let me recreate my business account. Keeps telling me I have reached the limit? How could I reach a limit when all I did was switch to a personal then try to go back to my business account?
Faults. Keeps telling me that there is a fault everytime i try to edit who can view my story. When i press unhide or hide it tells me it cant do it and theres an error. All in the privacy area
Someone hacked my account. And I dont know how. And I have had zero contact with anyone even though Ive reported the problem on MANY different avenues. Its like they just dont give a crap that Ive lost access to my account
"Problemas con los Reels. No se porque pero a veces Instagram me quita la opción de publicar reels, me ha pasado varias veces y luego me la colocan de nuevo, hace 1 semana me quitaron los reels y aún no me los colocan, según son problemas con las actualizaciones, tengo ese problema con mi Instagram de trabajo y con mi Instagram personal, pero en otra cuenta que tengo donde no publico nada si tiene la opción de los reels entonces no entiendo qué es lo que está pasando"

I logged out and can literally no long access my accounts on the app at all.Any attempts to login have been met with sorry a problem has occurredDoes not matter how I try to login, if its on the app, its not letting me on.I cant use the app anymore because of this and all of my support emails have been ignored"
"im not a fan of the 14 day name feature. i am really a big fan of instagram, i have been able to post pictures that i love and share my personal aesthetic with many people and make great friends. however, im so frustrated by the new update which only allows you to change your name twice every 14 days. im someone who loves to experiment with different icons (such as  and etc) but because of the new update, if i put an icon i dont like, i am pretty much stuck with it. i wish instagram would remove this feature or only apply it to business profiles"
Fix please. It doesnt want to load no matter what I do not on data nor internet it doesnt show a update eitherThe filters just wont show up and nothing is working for it to show up wont let me post at all either
App not refreshing in the background. Instagram notifications dont seem to be working. I do think this is because the app refuses to refresh for me in the background. I have ensured that all the iOS 14 Notifications settings have been enabled for Instagram. I have also ensured that DM messages have also been enabled in the Instagram settings. I have ensured that background refresh is also switched on for Instagram in the settings app. I have also made sure that do not disturb is on. Still notifications dont work and the app refuses to refresh in the background. I am very disappointed as nothing I do seems to work and Im unable to receive any notifications on my Lock Screen
"Password Reset. I got a message that my account has been hacked and that I need to change my password, but it gives me a link where I need to input my current password before making a new one which is stupid since Im hacked, and I also dont remember what password I was using before I got hacked either. Why cant they just send me the same reset password link that gets sent to your email? Im really upset because Ive been using Instagram for a long time but theres no way to contact live support or to recover my account as I have only connected my phone number to the account. Please help"
"Likes. Hi, I really enjoy Instagram. However when I like peoples dms to me its all weird. I preferred the original likes without the emoji and flying hearts. This is just my personal opinion and although I think its cool, Im not a fan of change lol. Yeah, so yeah"
"Serious glitches. For the past two weeks my IG will not work on cellular data. Every other app on my phone works, yet IG says NO INTERNET CONNECTION. Ive uninstalled and all. Its broken. I know Im not the only one:"
"Horrible system. When you delete the app and reinstall it with the correct login info, you have to go through a 2-step Authenticator THAT WILL NEVER SEND YOU THE CODE. Oh and same with the email. Then, you have to take a picture holding a code on a piece of paper with your face? Horrible system. Will not use again"
My rate. I love this app so much for some reason I cant get in my account and every time I re-downloaded and try to get in but it just says feedback
"Music doesnt work. Tried business acc, creator acc, and personal and none of them let me use music but tons of my friends that live in Canada are able to"
"music glitch thingy. on ig, i want to add music to my story... but envy time i try, the music is like spanish old music... i switched my account to personal, and deleted the app and downloaded it back, and it still wont work. honestly instagram is very disappointing, there has been many things wrong with it lately"
"Thank you for your service and creativity. Amazing app, details incredible"
"Fix. Im reporting that when I click on privacy blocked accounts more than half the accounts Ive blocked are not showing up in my list, but when I search for these accounts they show up and they say unblock user which means theyre blocked but I thought when you block a user they stay in your block list and you cannot see them in a search result and why when I click access data see blocked accounts all the accounts appear in that list but not the other one where I can see their profiles in the main list its strange and there has to be a glitch/bug that needs to be fixed immediately and to add also when I block more people the list wont show me the full amount of accounts Ive blocked I just updated the app today and still that did not fix the issue"

"Highlights  disappears. I used to be able to make story highlights, and I havent been able to for quite some time. I can on my business account but not my personal account. Why is this?"
"What happened. Whenever I click on the personal icon, bottom right, the screen goes black"
"Add yours sticker still not working. The add yours sticker does not work on my main and oldest account Ive reset my phone, Ive deleted and redownloaded the application, Ive changed my account from personal to business and still nothing brings it back It worked one time and now its not available to add to my stories nor can I click on the add yours in others peoples stories to add to. It works on my other accounts, why the heck does it not work on my main account? Its not fair or right. Please please please fix this, I shouldnt have to make a whole new account that works just fine when Ive had mine since 2014. Please help"

Please note Ive tried updating my app and reinstalling it a few times now. It works perfectly on my business page but not my personal account. Please update this feature for me"
Not put to help. Need to speak to someone... MULTI BILLION FORTUNE 50 company. Zero customer service how is this even possible. Music on stories NOPE instead a bunch of hacks on signing in and out and switching from business to personal. Get it together
"Bugs. Lately I&#39;m having trouble accessing chats. It doesnt load, neither on mobile data nor on wifi and this is really bothering me. Hope it gets fixed soon"
Would give 0 stars. App refuses to update so stuck with a old out dated version of it. Im on a iPhone 12 Pro so its not my phone
"Major app crashing. Instagram has been crashing and wont even allow me to sign in (on iPhone XR, iOS 14) for the past two weeks or so.  Ive redownloaded the app several times, restarted my phone, deleted app data, etc. and to no availGiving this app 1 star because if I cant even get in it doesnt do its job on any level"
"Music access change. This music access change is bad, when I try posting a song like from nirvana it doesnt show up, the name shows up in the search bar when I type it but doesnt exist, instead it shows all these weird russian, bts songs that no one has ever heard of. I switched my account back to personal and nothing has happened. This is really annoying and I hope it gets fixed soon. I reported it to Instagram about it and havent received a response back"
I was hacked have nothing to do. Please help me get my account back. I did everything to get the account back and reported the account so it can get deleted because the hacker is pretending to be me. The hacker changed the email and phone number and I think password. Either he changed the password or logged me out then turned on the setting where you have to request to log in. I have all the evidence you need that it is my name Brenon Thiel even the profile picture is still me so can you help me get my account back before he says something bad to somebody I know and they think it is me. The username is brenonthiel
"Chat Names. Dear Instagram , with this quarantine you have a lot of time on your hands to develop this new suggestion wish im sure have been voiced before , with this next update me and my fellow instagram users would like if we could rename personal one on one dms , or chat messages as you could in three or more chat conversations. this would improve mine and others time and usage of this app tremendously and my rating shall remain a one star until further notice when things change. sincerely,                  Bobbie &amp; others"
"Impossible to delete DMs. The theory of the app is awesome but the coding is apparently poor. You can delete a DM as many times as you want, in a day or so it will reappear. Got a harassing message or a spam DM that you have reported, blocked, and deleted? Look forward to seeing it again next time you check your messages. Problem has persisted for more than 6 months, so it isnt just an update concern. It also makes me a bit nervous to what they are doing saving all the data that cannot be deleted"
"Redownloaded the App. I cant even log in after redownloading the app, it kept showing feedback required and i cant access my accounts at all"
Blurry Profile images jpeg but nothing worked. Still blurry images on profile picture Tried every method Great Data connection jpeg vs LS Photoshop please fix thanks guys 
"Music feature is gone. Music feature one day just disappeared. I tried to switch from business to personal, didnt work. I switch to creators, didnt work. I texted IG help, no answer"
Minds Data. Program uses significant amount of battery life while mining data
please fix bugs. app is showing my creator title on profile when i have it set not to and wont let me change my account back to personal
Yes but. Sometimes I DO feel like Im being spied on but generally I waste as much time as anyone else here so i must accept the consequences of it. The adds are a bit much and Im quite sure my number and info is prob being sold but its probably my fault for clicking on those adds sometimes
Mucho anuncio. Por qué ahora vemos tanto anuncio publicitario en nuestra cuenta de Instagram? En lo personal no me agrada ver tanto anuncio
"Notifications??. I dont know where this got lost in the coding or etc, but you guys need to get the notification game back on track. Most of the time I dont even get notifications anymore. Plus, no sound notifications when someone goes on live? Why was this feature taken out? Regardless, get it back on track. Come on now"
Hacking issue. I see the Russian chick still has my account I also see you refuse to close the account that doesnt belong to her and is not her name
Fix log in. I had to delete my Insta for a personal reason and when I redownloaded it I could only get into my main account not my other ones and its very frustrating cause I worked hard for them so when someone downloads it again pls let them log in imgoing thru a lot to log back in so pls help me
I cant retrieve my ig. I am completely unable to get in to my personal/ business again. I cant change the password and now I have to wait till ig gets around to see in two days. There seems to be a glitch or something because the app sends me in circles or tells me they are unable to have a new password to change it again . But I can sign in my other two accounts but not my main one . Its really annoying that this has happened. So many hoops to jump threw to get my ig back . But these hackers can get in an take our information. I just hoping this gets resolved really soon
"No help from support. Had my account hacked, finally regained access to it only to have it disabled a week and a half later. Support doesnt work at all. Can message them all you want through their support never responds just automated emails. Please help fix this"
"Please fix. Im reporting that when I click on privacy blocked accounts more than half the accounts Ive blocked are not showing up in my list, but when I search for these accounts they show up and they say unblock user which means theyre blocked but I thought when you block a user they stay in your block list and you cannot see them in a search result and why when I click access data see blocked accounts all the accounts appear in that list but not the other one where I can see their profiles in the main list its strange and there has to be a glitch/bug that needs to be fixed immediately this has never happened to me before since the last update"
Darkness. This update has made the app unusable. Nothing loads. Doesnt matter what wifi or data Im connected to I get nothing. I redownloaded it and it worked for a couple minutes then went right back to nothingness
"I dont like it. I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD It wont let me delete a convo that I never has for one. For two THERES a hack going around stealing ppls passwords. Three its just boring. Ik these might be personal problems, but its still very irritating.They also spam you and I mean SPAM you with notifications about following people that u dont even know.  And about other stuff"
"My ig is missing and no one helps. My ig is missing, I can not log in and neither find the account anymore. IG log me out and asked to  verify by cel phone, when I tried that they never sent me a code and I have received a notification that I have 30 days otherwise my account will be permanent deleted. After that I tried to request report for my ig account and there is a glitch where I can not send the request because the keyboard does not goes down and I cant hit the bottom to send. I tried to contact IG and it is impossible I can not believe that I will lose my account that I have for more than years with all memories of my personal life. I never received any email about anything. I feel very invade. Honestly it is very disrespectful"
I cant use reels. For some reason one my personal account I have access to making reels but on my business account its not available and everything I do to try and fix it doesnt work
Best market for scammers. Ive been hacked. The girl  lovely_maria40400 was able to change all my passwords emails phone numbers and try to scam thousands of my friends out of money. Best part is Instafool has no one to contact and give her more help then me. I was actually restricted from making another page so I could see what she was doing on my page
Time. Im really frustrated they removed the ability to see the time in the app. They are just trying to spend more time in the app by losing track. Its really annoying. I use this app during my lunch break and get really stressed when I cant see the time within the app
Maddison. Can you fix it so that I dont have to write my number or my personal email on it I dont want people to know
Versatility and creative. Incredible app to be able to express ourselves through photography and model quality photos
Bugs and glitches. I have a personal blog page People have been managing to message me directly into primary inbox without me accepting their messages. I am not able to see how many people are following my page or how many people I am following. I cannot repost or share any posts or stories from any other pages. I have reinstalled the app and reset the password many times and still glitching Please someone get back to me on this
Generally I really like this app but. Its glitchy AF for me for the past few months. I still dont have reels on my main business account but I have them on my personal account on the same device.Ive sent them so many messages about it but nothing has changed
"Incredible. This app is so amazing I 100% recommend if you like to be creative and like showing the world what your made of~ Its so fun to post things that can inspire people in so many ways, its so heartwarming to get comments from people going through the same things as you. You can make friends from all over the world and create great bonds with them as well Take it from a person whos had this app for a long time, It has really changed my life in a positive way, and I believe it can do the same for you Why not give it a try?"
Needs Updates. Please consider removing former usernames. Or even giving the option to hide those to the public eye. Its for privacy reasons
Terrible customer support. I got my phone stolen and couldnt access my two step verification anymore. I contacted help and they verified my identity but still didnt solve the issue. They were basically useless and Ive lost access to an account Ive had for many years
Needs another update. Cant delete spam conversations or old messages

"Bug. NOTHING is loading. I have tried data and wifi, both work on other apps. For some reason after uninstalling several times i still cant get it to load. Please fix"
Unable To Upload Videoclip. What a joke. Each version get more problematic as IG concentrated on data harvesting. Takes 10 minutes to upload which used to take 10 seconds. Nice work IG
"music. so I used to have a creator account but I switched back to a personal account a while ago , like 2 days ago I chose to switch back to a creator account just to do it and all my music changed.. I on my had music in languages I didnt know... I looked it up and it said try switching back to personal or just reinstall the app , literally neither worked so now I cant use the music, it told me that business accounts or creator account couldnt use the music because of copyright but any other time I was able to.. idk if its just a glitch but Ive seen like 5 people I follow have the same problem; please fix this"

notification issue. the app is great but ever since i got a new phone and downloaded the app there is no option to turn on my notifications for the app
Bugs Galore. After most recent update. My personal stories do not load for me anymore. They disappear after a few hours of posting. All of the stories in my highlights have disappeared as well. Need a fix now
No customer support. I have been trying to switch my account to personal so I can make my account private for months and I cant because I keep getting a glitch that says I have pending promotions when I tried to delete the pending promotion it would not let me so I cant make my account private and theres absolutely no one available to help. Please offer SOME sort of customer support
Add to story not working. My add to story button just disappeared and I dont even have the resharing button in my privacy anymore
UGH. I HATE THE UPDATE. STOP TRYING TO SELL ME STUFF AND PUSH VIDEOS. BRING BACK THE NOTIFICATIONS AND NEW POST AT THE BOTTOM. I WILL WRITE A BETTER REVIEW IF YOU CHANGE IT BACK
"Account Disabled and Locked. Help My account was disabled or deactivated by IG today. I dont know what I did, but I am desperate to get it back. I know this: my username and first/last name is still showing, my page says user not found and my account was not hacked. However, I am unable to verify account because my phone and email are not receiving the 6 digit verification code. Please help And no spam comments please, I am only seeking real advice and tips. I already reached out many times to the help page today and sent in requests. What the heck is going on??"
Update is TERRIBLE. They trained us to tap in one spot to check notifications and then WHAM They switched it up so it takes you to the new store to push product. We hate companies that are sell outs and start to lose what made them unique and appealing
"ZERO customer service availability. I like the idea  of this app and have had an account for years, but use it so infrequently that I tend to forget my password and have to reset from time to time. No big deal.However, I just tried to log on and couldnt. The button to send password reset info didnt work. It says  Sorry, we cant send you a login link. Contact Instagram for help. My issues with this are:1) I have an email set up with them that is linked to my account so there should be no reason that I cant receive my reset information. Ive received reset emails in the past and receive daily junk mail from them (just info about people I follow, etc.). How are they able to send me these daily account updates but not a password reset link??2) There is ZERO customer support outside of the FAQ online... which is not helpful in my situation. I even emailed some old email address I found (which was returned undeliverable) and I called a phone number and waited forever to leave a voicemail - but even on the recording it said that the voicemail was rarely checked so it would probably not do any good.I understand that a company this large probably would be fielding quite a few phone calls and emails, but Id be satisfied to leave an email/voicemail and get a response several weeks from now if I knew it would be coming. So Im kind of in a pickle. Cant access my account, but it is still active (Ive been able to confirm that at least). But doesnt seem Ill ever be able to access it again, as I cant seduce why they wouldnt be able to email me a link and cant get ahold of anyone to assist"
Lack of support service. Ive been locked out of my main due to being hacked. The hacker changed my email and phone number so I cannot send a link to myself to recover the account. I cant find anything to fix this on their help center. There is also no support line to call
Unable to reshare stories. I cant reshare a story from an account that I run to my personal This is very upsetting
"Where is my music sticker. I used to have it and it has completely disappeared. Ive tried everything, deleting the app, logging out, switching from business account to personal. Help"
"Wheres the music gone?. Switched back to a personal account and I still cant access my usual music, so annoying"
"Just A Few Complaints. Hi Instagram,Lately Ive been having this problem where Ilol like something and then it will unlike itself, then Id have to go back and re like it. Its quite annoying and its happening on all the accounts I use. Also just a personal complaint of mine- I dont like how videos or pictures on my explore page will automatically go to the next thing. I liked the option of scrolling to see the next post rather than an automatic jump.Thanks for an amazing platform"
Fix this. Please make it so i am able to make my account private. I have reached out multiple times. I cannot switch to personal account because i have active promotions running when i do not. I cannot end these promotions because they are not approved. I cannot navigate your new update. Being respectful and polite gets you no where. I have plenty of money and time to sue. My lawyers will be contacting you soon if this issue is not resolved
Keeps getting worse. Whatever update makes reading long captions impossible has about ruined this app. Anytime I try to just slightly scroll down to read a long photo caption the app just slings me to the next picture making reading any captions so difficult. What is the point?
Bugs everywhere. I no longer recieve any push notifications from my personal or business account (yes I have tried everything with the settings). When on the app it states I have three messages on my business account. There are no messages. This happens everyday.I highly doubt anything will be done about these issues. A once great app is now a riddled mess of errors
"Doesnt let me log into my personal account. Ive been trying to reach out and I have no answer as to how I can login into my personal account.  I deactivated my account and I wanted to re activated.  Somehow I was able to change the password but It still doesnt let me log in telling me that I need to confirm its me.  It only sends me to a help center with no accurate answer.  I need my account back, please help"
"Not working. I have had IG for years now.  I just decided to make a business page and it wont let me make more than 22 posts.  Why is that? This has been disappointing, my personal page has over 1000 posts and I have never encountered any issues. I just posted on my personal page yet I cant post on my brand new business page? Ridiculous"
Music Sticker Wont show up. Its been like months since the music sticker came out for stories and at first I had it but then I didnt and its been months and I still dont have it. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled like 100x switched my profile from personal to business and back Ive logged in an out all that and still no fix
The Grege Show. I love sharing my personal and professional life in a safe and supportive space. I love the creativity that Instagram has offered making my journey a bit easier#GregeMorris
"Needs some improvements. Please add feature to save photo templatesSometimes my drafts dont save or get deleted when I try to open them back up after previously saving to add more picturesBring back photo bordersDont censor anti-gov, anti-capitalist, anti fascist voices, dont censor nudityAllow more privacy features for who can comment, etc"
love this app. The new features in the update are incredible
"dms are broken. i run a business account as well as a personal. on my business account dms arent coming through essentially at all. i get the first message, then the notification wont go away and yet still when i reply i cant see what they have sent. please fix this issue, this is my work"
"Account hacked. I can not log into my account  Please help . I was using it this morning , refreshed the stories and a pop up came to enter my password and email . Nothing is working . Please help"
Absolutely Enjoy this app. Able to connect with so many people from all over the world that share in the same interests and hobbies as myself its truly incredible I really love it so much
"Toooooooo many ads. Anyone else notice how every 4th post is an ad? Youre making all this money off of selling my info, and now youve dramatically upped your game at wasting my time too?"
Nice. The thing Dey chop data Biko 
Hey Guys. They locked my account all i was trying to watch some fortnite 
"I Have Been Unable To Access My Account For Over A Week. I havent been able to log into my account for over a week after receiving a suspicious activity notification when I attempted to log in on another device. I received a text message with a number to confirm my account and I got a message that said I would gain access to my account in roughly 24 hours. It has been well past that obviously and now when I attempt to use my email or phone number to log in it says that no account can be found. When I use my username and password it simply says that something went wrong. try again over and over. I have also tried to go through the forgot password process and it says that my account is attached to an email that Ive never seen. I also tried to report my account as hacked and even though it said it would send me an automatic email to confirm, I did not receive one. There is no way to contact any form of support for the app, which is absurd for such a major app, so I cant do anything else. I really need my account back as there are a large amount of irreplaceable photos/videos and numerous friends that I only have contact with on the app. Can anyone suggest how I could potentially get my account back? This has been a ridiculous process"
"Unfortunately Hacked. Hacked three times this year, people stealing my identity"
"Please fix these issues . These are personal issues but I feel like I should report it. The color for the text messages for the dms are not that appealing to the eye i do miss the dark theme for the dms and the new dms icon at the top right is also not appealing to the eye. Thats all, Be safe and have a nice day"
"Terrible New Update. Why are your notifications buttons at the bottom now to shop and or make reels?  Now everything personal to you and your account is squished off to the side. People you follow posts, notifications, messages, etc while pushing to look at things to shop that you may or may not have zero to no interest in"
"Acting glitchy. The app is not showing me data on my main account and would not text me a verification code, instead telling me to try later"
"Worst app performance in phone. The app uses too much battery for the little usage I give to the app, it is killing the battery life of my phone and data usage also is too high, developer needs to fix those issues"
"Cant post videos to my story. Every time I try to post a video on my story that may result in multiple slides, it automatically fails and wont let me post it. I have to save each individual video it breaks it down into and post each individual video. This was never a problem before and now it is very aggravating and time consuming. My data doesnt seem to be the problem either because the issue happened regardless if Im on wifi or cellular data. Please fix this issue ASAP because Im sure Im not the o my one going through this headache for no reason"
"Messages not sending. My messages wont send unless I delete the app, then re download it. It makes for a very difficult conversation to have"
"Multiple photos post feature gone. A couple days ago I noticed the multiple photos post feature disappeared. Since then Ive tried reinstalling the app, logging out and back in, rebooting my phone and erasing the cache data but its still not there. I asked two other iPhone users and theirs is gone too. Is this a glitch??"
Crashes. On my phone everytime I try to open the app it crashes and exits me out the app. I have no access to my Instagram. Only if I log in through safari
Vanish mode is not safe. Please fix vanish mode so nobody can be notified when screenshots are taken I find that to be very invasive of privacy I dont want people to know when I take screenshots or if they take screenshots of chats. That makes people think theyre being stalked Very dangerous feature if you ask me Disable PLEASE
"No music for my posts. Ive been using IG for years and recently for personal and business use. I noticed that the add music feature has vanished. Ive changed phones since, reinstalled the app and also updated it, but I have no add MUSIC feature. Ive messaged and emailed for help and no response Its not on IG"
"i cant hide my category. my account is set as creator and i made my category just for fun. i want to hide the category because it says that you have the choice to hide it or display it, but no matter what i do it will not let me hide it. ive tried updating instagram, refreshing instagram, restarting my phone, but nothing has worked. ive gone to my other accounts to check and see if the category was visible to others on my account but it still is and i have no idea how to fix it. ive tried switching back to a personal account and then going back to the creator account but still it has not worked. idk what the issue is but id like for it to be fixed. ive already reported the issue on my instagram, but i have yet to hear a reply"
Music in Story NOT working. I am in Canada and have a biz account.  Tried everything in the books to get the music option to work in story but no success. Then switched my account to personal but still doesnt work.  I am seeing all my colleagues posting with music with a biz accounts set up.  Am I doing something wrong??  Help pls
"Horrible service when hacked. My account was hacked now someone is harassing and scamming friends, family and random people. At first I gave up on the account and created a new one. Now the person is using my new post on the hacked page. Ive tried using there methods to gain access back to my account or get it deactivated. This has been going on for months"
Hacked. I have been hacked. My email and password have been changed. Unfortunately I didnt know until it was too late. I have tried everything in my power to try and fix this. I have even recorded a video of myself to show proof that it is me in my now hacked accounts pictures. I received an email stating that the information couldnt be confirmed. Ive tried using the security code options and nothing seems to be working. Not even the Authenticator codes that I numerously keep putting in. I tap on the I cant access email or phone number option and takes me to another link that just loads Nothing happens I am so frustrated. This is literally my last resort in reaching out to someone from IG. Please help me
"Direct Messaging. I have made many reports about a bug I have experienced in direct messaging and none of it has been resolved. For months I have experienced issues with sending videos through dm and it seems the issue only occurs with videos, not pictures. When I try to send a video it loads for a long time and eventually says there was an error. I have tried on different WiFis and on my own data and it continues to happen, therefore it cant be an internet issue. Please solve this issue"
Not working with WiFi. This app has basically stop working for at least 6 months if not longer unless Im on cellular data. This makes it very difficult since I live in the mountains and have 1 bar of cellular. Ive basically given up but reading other people reviews and seeing that it not just me is really disappointing that it still broken 
It keeps logging me out. I tried to log in so many times after updating it and it keeps logging me out when i do manage to Access my account there is nothing there the account is blank. I have tried resetting my password but it doesnt let me it says the page cant be found. I deleted it and then installed it again but its still the same problem This has never happened before in the 4 years i have been using this app. And i know the problem isnt my phone as i can log into my Bourdieu da without any issues
"Login issues. I run a nonprofit account alongside my personal account, and I cant log in to my nonprofit even though all the information is right. Just says error occurred and I know many others who have this issue. So I have to login on safari and make posts which is not ideal or convenient. Of course theres no way to talk to an actual support person and the website doesnt help at all"
Unsatisfactory. Someone hacked my original account. I need help retrieving it
"Constant glitches. If it werent for the people and communities on Instagram, I wouldve deleted this app a long time ago. Constant glitches almost every month. Today all my messages would randomly disappear within an hour of sending them, just vanish I tried deleting the app and downloading it again in hopes it would fix the problem and it did, but it also made Instagram so much worse. All of my features disappeared and all my unique things are gone, I had set all my emojis to be my own personal list that resonated with me, and now I only have the read heart. All my chats had special unique themes depending on who the chat was with, now theyre all just black. I am extremely sad to have lost all of this. I know its just small unimportant things but knowing that it was kind of original to my and my patterns was nice and now its all gone. I am extremely sad, I hope it can go back to normal soon"
someone hacked my account. its annoying please help me get it back
Hate the new layout. I think IG forgot the reason why so many people love it. Our pics in it. Not the sellers reels or whatever else is now crowding the place we had our happy buttons...Legit failI havent been able toOpen DMs in my personal account for over a week NO ONE cares to buy in IG more than their DMs...Reels are useless. Stop trying to copy tiktok. Youre slowing down the app for no reasonGo back to your basics which is why people love the app
"Post quality isnt good unless its 1 picture per post. Why will I upload a video post &amp; it uploads fine quality but then all the sudden everytime i get to it, it is super blurry?? It is not my internet connection because ive tried multiple different wifis and also my data. Also please fix the quality of uploaded pictures when posting multiple pictures/videos in one post, they always end up blurry and super unflattering"
Afghanii. Theres just one problem my _nichill page cannot even switch back to a personal account whats up with that
"My account. I had a problem with my account, it was temporarily blocked.  And I don&#39;t have access to the security data, the email doesn&#39;t exist anymore and the number doesn&#39;t either.  I need another way to recover my account"
New update is awful. Its auto-playing pictures disguised as videos.It continuously scrolls while wasting a tremendous amount of battery and data
Take some feedback. The shopping tab should have been placed where you put the notifications. What are you doing ??????
Music on stories not working. Music option on stories no longer works. I switched back to a personal account and it still wont work
Cant search music on personal acct. Idk whats up with IG lately but it will not let me search for music for the past couple days does this need to update again?
"Slow. I use this for personal and business, and its slow, way slow, like a 100% bounce rate not loading slow"
"wont post stories or pictures. i tried to post something but it was stuck on sending. i turned my wifi off and on again, i switched to data, i restarted both of my devices, and i even uninstalled it and installed it again but it still didnt work. i waited 10 minutes and it was still stuck on sending. when i tried to post something on my story to complain about it, the same thing happened. it was working fine a few minutes ago. did your website just crash when i tried to post two things in one day? because i know it isnt because of my connection because all my other apps are working too. for an app whose entire purpose is to post photos and stories, this shouldnt be a problem"
Freezing. Please fix the app  Every time I try to watch stories it constantly freezes up. Doesnt matter if Im connected to WiFi or using cellular data. I have the latest update as well. PLEASE FIX
Needs updating. Recent updates have made the app massively data heavy. If I open the app then whatever Im streaming instantly freezes
Missing notifications. I have the notification settings turned on in the app and on my phone but I still get no notifications until I open the app. This is really annoying because I follow a lot of limited time selling shops and I turn on post notifications. It also just ruins conversation flow if I forget to open the app and check my dms again Ive uninstalled the app 3 times and still have this issue
So many bugs for multiple accounts. I have two different IG accounts. One is personal & one is for business. It seems like every update my business account messes up somehow. I make my money through IG & for the past week I have not been able to see any of my messages. I have emailed about this issue. It keeps making it seem like my DMs updated or something. But on my other account. No problems. Its frustrating. I literally have to look up someones name to see if they sent me a message
Thank you mark very cool. Pretty sure Im being spied on but I dont mind it I get funny memes
AmaZingly. Amazing app for business and personal use and am shocked its free. 
Black screens. My personal homepage is pure black
"REELS not working. I have reels on my personal account but not my business account. I have reported this issue more than 10 times over a course of half a year, but nothing. It seems the Report feature is just a gimmick - I wonder how many reports they have but dont give the e time of day to respond/fix"
Hacked. App works like it should. But keep getting login notifications from all over the world
"Some bad shots here, and some really good photos. Great spot to share rubbish shots, but there are some really professional images here that need a place like Flickr to give some EXIF data and better descriptions....  not nearly as good as Flickr"
Amazing. I text My friends and stuff Incredible 10/10 Should download
"Horizontal for Ipad Users. I use my iPad continuously in the horizontal mode to accommodate a Bluetooth keyboard, as do thousands of others like me. It would be incredible if I could go to my Instagram app and work there as well instead of having to switch to a vertically mode"
Annoying notifications. The so and so recently posted a story type notifications are beyond obnoxious. I run 2 work accounts in addition to my personal account and I dont appreciate my personal phone constantly blowing up with these random notifications. Yet theres no way to turn them off. Ive literally had to unfollow people who post stories often because of the constant annoyance
"Login error. Im connected to WiFi but its still giving no internet connection, I even tried using my mobile data and it still doesnt work this app stinks fix pleaseeeee"

They dont fix the problems you report. I have been having this problem for about 2 weeks now where my saved will not load. It is not because of my wifi because I have tried it on other wifi and my data. It is stuck in a forever loading symbol and they have yet to fix it even though I have reported the issue several times
"Internet. Para los que no saben aún el chisme. Ahora instagram espiará nuestras caras con nuestras camaras del movil cuando reacionemos a cada publicación de la app según las nuevas políticas y usos de la aplicación, tendrá acceso a información personal también de cada usuario y esto es para &#34;recomendarnos&#34; contenido que más nos agrade ver. De nada"
Old account. I have an old account that was hacked by my ex when he stole my old phone years ago. He has changed my email and password. So I no longer have access to the account.

"Music Option is Nonexistent. Ever since I updated, the music option doesnt appear. I cant do a reel without music and the option is just not there for stories nor reels. I can add the music to reels and stories I create on my personal account, but not my business account"

"Pretty rad, lotta bugs. If I click on a notification without the app still in my tabs, they dont load, and crash the app, If I try to use the music sticker, I cant see what Im typing in the search bar, just a plain white rectangle, and as of this morning I can no longer like posts. Its an incredible app but good lord there are so many bugs that its almost unusable. Filters are really cool though, the pride ones slap"

They were racy and he knew that telling me to continue with the same smut it sells you know that . Anyway I got a bar on top that said change your theme . I was incredulous . I didnt think that you would censor a messages by a 57 year old woman who spent last year recovering from a severe ischemic stroke that almost took my life . I am unable to do many things I did before . In messenger it is a shared account and besides too easily hacked . So this seemed perfect for both of us now Im scared to continue . I dont use word its too complicated for a old woman like me . And since the stroke my eyes both are not so good but Inhave this keyboard pretty well memorized and I can see"

VIDEOS WITH SONGS WONT SEND. These vids are 15 seconds and are fairly short, however they keep failing to send with no retry option. I have repeatedly checked to make sure my app was updated multiple times but that seems to not be the issue. Ive even checked my network and data connections and they still fail to send.

Music glitch?. Music isnt working. I have the sticker to add music but its limited to the Facebook songs now. Ive made all my accounts into personal and nothing has worked. Ive deleted and reinstalled the app several times. Logged in and logged out. Nothing changes this and its one of my favorite features on the app. Sad
Cant sign in. I tried to sign back to my personal account and spam account but I wont log me in. I tried to sign in with Facebook and send a link to my number but still wont log me in still. I went delete it and re-download it but still wont work. Please fix it. And now I cant sign in my other account now. It always says that theres a problem with your requests. I just want to be back with my accounts again. This app is being racist to me
"turn off screenshots and vanish mode. i dont appreciate the vanish chat mode and screen shot notification feature this is an invasion of privacy and downright disgusting , remove this update asap"
"Rarely works. App continues to crash, wont download anything on WiFi or using data"
"eh. Has a weird bug where when we I try and make a reel it throws the threes a crowd filter on every single time also it would just delete the reel that Ive created for no reason. Also the fact that my account got hacked three times and customer service didnt help me once, Id wouldnt even  surprised if there was no human customer service. Shouldnt have to go through hoops for help. But you also shouldnt take our information.  Fix your app"
"Loading problem. This app is incredible but can you please help with the loading system. I enter the app everyday but when it came today Pepe loading, its not my WiFi because its full bars and I already restarted, deleted and re-downloading the app but its still not loading....please help"
¯\_()_/¯. Aight soI deleted the app so I could reinstall it because my notifications were broken and now I cant re-download it. Mf Broke 
"Get Rid of Suggested Posts. Great app, been using it for years. The suggested posts are borderline spam and should have a enable/disable functionality"
"Profile error when editing. Still cant edit my profile. Despite the many bug reports, app reviews, and help submissions for solution not working Receive error messages or a message saying to connect to data or WiFi. Wish they would fix this soon. Its happened to a ton of people"
"No notifications. Hey, I don&#39;t know if this has to do with the new update or something but my notifications don&#39;t seem to be working at all, I have to go on the app to see them"
STILL unable to log in. when will the app be functioning again?? at this point you are stealing my money because i am paying for an app that wont even allow paying users to access their content. this is unacceptable
Awesome Tax Service. Personal & Business
"Music Issue. Had a business account and got their notification that I can no longer use the normal music library, but I then switched to a personal account and still cant use any normal music. Fix this please"
"Bug fixes. Hi Im loving the new update with the filters, but Im having trouble with my music feature. Its not allowing me to find mainstream artist or their music. The only thing its showing me is music from random people and I really hope you all fix it. On one of my business pages it allows me to find these mainstream artist, but on my personal page it does not allow me to find these people. Even if I were to type in Megan Thee Stallion nothing pops up. I dont know if Im the only one with this problem, but I hope its soon to be fixed so I can start back adding music to my videos and pictures"
Unable to access my personal account. I have not been successful in getting logged back in. I have no idea how to regain access
Soaks. I needed to make a personal account and have a separate account but it saying I can&#39;t conform my email this sucks
Please help me log into my account. I need a 2 factor authentication code to log into my account. I do not have access to the codes since my account is disconnected from DuoMobile. I have sent multiple  request forms and called the phone number various times and no response Please help me get my code so I can log into my account
"Things not working. My music icon and reels icon completely disappeared. I tried logging out , even deleted the app and reinstalled it over and over again . I tried switching from business to personal and then personal to business account .Still I cannot see the reels option or the music option to put on my story . I hate this .If this doesnt get fixed Im just deleting this stupid app"
"No Explore Page. Im pretty upset about losing the explore page to reels. It uses so much more data to constantly be loading videos, and provides a lot less selection"
Wont download on my iPhone 13 mini. Had issues when I initially set up my new phone. The Instagram toolbars were overlapping and app wouldnt work.Deleted the app to reinstall it and it just refuses to download. App tech support cant figure out the issues
"Music glitch. For the last two weeks, my music under stories isnt working. I have no American music (I.e. Ciara, Morgan wallen, etc.) its Russian, instrumental, Mexican and other international music. I keep getting an error saying that I didnt have access to certain music because of my business account but I havent even had a business account in months (switched to personal). This is so annoying because I run my side biz through social media and need normal music back"
"Keep crashing. Iphone ios 13.7 Instagram is also up to date. The instagram keeps crashing itself even before logging in page pops up. Tried deleting all the data, app itself, reinstalling, turning off and on the phone, and even wiping out the phone data entirely, but still the app wont work. It drives me nut but seems like I cant do anything.. anyone gots similar issues?"
Account not working. Can not access my account. All it says is something went wrong every time I try to log in. I tried resetting my password but would not load after the page that says to make sure all my information is still correct
"Won't let me login. Recently I created a second acc for personal use, but it keeps sending me a suspicious activity alert. After I enter my phone number, the security code doesn&#39;t send"
This is full of hackers and scammers. I will not download this App ever again . Get rid of the garbage that is on this App .    My rate is   -0 its the worse App  on the Internet
Beware Do not download. The update contains bugs that randomly log you out of your account and prevent you from accessing it
Im just confused as to why my DM icon is still the paper airplane. and I dont have the option to update messenger. I originally thought its because I live in the UK but I literally just made another account and it has the updated icon. But my personal account is still the old version
I cant login. My account is corascoloringz AND I POST SO MUCH U THINK IM HACKED. IM NOT. now I just have this thing where I have to verify who I am. THATS NOT MY PHONE NUMBER PLEASE FIX THIS I NEED A LOT OF HELP. just please help this situation
"Stolen/Hacked. My account has been hacked and stolen, and I cant workout how to stop this"
"Glitches. Majority of the Video content I view on Instagram are showing up blurry or patchy. Its really weird because I have a personal and professional account that is linked, and Im only having this issue with my personal account. Ive been using Instagram since it first came out and Ive never had this issue until December 2020. Ive tried updating, deleting and reinstalling the app but the issue still remains. I even reached out to Instagram but I didnt get a response. Another issue is, if I exit the app while its on the Reels tab? The sound from the reel will continue to play"
"Turning off tagging. Until I HAD to update on 4/26 l, I was able to comment on posts without having backlash via tagged comments from people I dont know. I cannot find a way to block comments from people I do not know. Ive tried to do what I can, but its not working. I should be able to, under FREE SPEACH, comment on posts without getting tagged with hateful comments responding to my unpopular opinions. Especially if my profile is private. People should be able to respond to posts without being pummeled by hate when its not accepted by pandering opinion. AKA my conservative views. So very sad for you. Not everyone is welcoming to a hateful debate. Invoking hate speech when it doesnt fit the left agenda. Good job"
"Where is my update. I feel so behind, but am I the only one without the new story updated features? I dont have the reels options, I dont have the new text fonts. I only have it on my small business account but not on my personal account. It bugs me because its been a while since everyone on my feed has had these new features and I havent lol"
"Support is non existent. Changed password, went to login, had to enter a code sent to my phone number which I never received no matter how many times I try. There is no one to reach out to. Ive filled out the forms sent pictures verifying my identity and thats about the extent of it. There is nothing wrong with my account, no one hacked it, my email and phone are still connected yet I cant login because of a code Im not receiving which isnt my fault. I dont have the recovery codes. This is ridiculous and it doesnt seem like theres any way around it. No option to have it sent to my email instead. No option to do anything but hope one day the code actually sends"
"Cant access my account. Hey , does anybody know how i can get in contact with employee so they can help me ?"
"Last update wont work with cellular. This latest revision (v230.0.0.20.113) does not work at all with 5G data, only works for me with wi-fi. Dont you  do any testing before shipping a new release that breaks the app?"
"Irritating. I don't have the same features on 2 profiles that I own, on the same phone. Literally the app looks totally different on 2 different profiles on the SAME phone. It's so frustrating, why does this happen? On my main personal profile I have old features and can't update it. "
Single login for multiple accounts. Please bring this feature back. Why change it?Now the app is just a headache to use. I have multiple business accounts/personal so this is a MAJOR inconvenience now and will only make me use the app less. Please bring it back
"The app is glitching out. The app was randomly ending calls, and etc, but now its saying it cant load my pages or ANYTHING. Extremely disappointed. I checked my wife, data, and everything was working well"
Ask. Why can&#39;t I reply to a message in a personal relationship?
Whack. Still upset the photos arent shown in chronological order. Crashes every now and then are annoying too. Theres ads on reels now that you cant skip. Its more of a marketing site than a personal blog type of thing now
"No reels for me :(. Im a big fan of this app, BUT for some reason I cant use the reels in my profile, I have tried many different options but still any of them is working for my profile, I have deleted the app, change the account from personal to public, then the other way around, update the app, and many other without any success "
The new update to messages is awful. PLEASE change it back to grey or at least make message color personal instead of shared
Shopping icon. This shopping icon is stupid and annoying. I want my notifications back where it was. Annoying thats its not easier access for the notifications. CHANGE IT BACK Im not going to use the shopping center ever All you guys care about now is money and its sad
"I cant remove account. I dont like how you cannot remove an account, after youve already made one on a phone. I made my personal account on my moms phone and I cant even take it off. I dont know maybe theres a solution but its kind of annoying"
"Inconsistent. I had the Music option on Stories, which I used all the time, taken from me recently. No one else I know has experienced this. If I did something to make this happen - why am I not notified? How am I supposed to fix this? It feels personal and its entirely unfair that Im the only person I know that no longer has it. Where am I supposed to seek help for this? Who am I supposed to call? Ive messaged and tweeted IG. No responses"
"DMs not working. Ive used this app for years but suddenly my DMs on my personal account are broken. Ive tried everything.. everytime I send a DM to someone I cant go back to the text, cant be added to any gcs, etc. this is ridiculous"
":|. This app literally seems to be getting worse with every update. Why would you place the reels button at the bottom center and move the regular button to post? Posting pictures in the main thing with this app. And then moving the button to check notifications to prioritize a shopping section?? Placement says a lot about priority. And now the vanish update? Why?? What is the point?? You want to make it more difficult to keep up with conversations? Basically, everything added thus far recently has been pointless and more so annoying especially considering that yall are just taking features from other apps"
"Easily hacked with no help from customer service. My account of many years was hacked and the hacker changed my account password, email and phone number. I tried contacting customer service many times and you cant speak to a live person all you get is web page instructions that gives you the run around in which I lost total control of my account while these hackers post stuff to lure people to talk to them while they pretend to be the owner of account that others know you. Theyve been reported multiple times and yet its been 3 almost 4 months and Im still not able to get my account back. Multibillion dollar company but they cant afford customer service representatives to assist us when needed"
Very wrong. I cant get into my account because someone changed my email and phone number that hacked my account very unfair
Music update glitch?? Help. So all of the good music on the insta sticker just fcked off I guess? I thought maybe its bc of copyright so I switched to a personal account from a business account and deleted the app then re-downloaded it. It hasnt been fixed. I miss the good music
cant react to messages. so i have a few accounts on this app (my spam acc &amp; main/personal) and only got the emoji reaction to messages update on ONE account:/ please fix this id like to have the update on all my accounts
Bull crud. Youve locked me out over a post I know nothing about. Sent a shot of the post too small to read.  Now to re-activate my account you reference an E Mail address that doesnt exist and a phone number that had to be scrapped from all the spam calls I was getting after using zip recruiter. Whatta racket
Spy ninjas. I join you guys
Cant login. I am having issues logging into my personal and most importantly my business account It keeps saying invalid parameters Ive never had this issue before until today.... dont know if it has to do with the update or what.... Ive tried deleting and reinstalling
"Please Fix This Account Issue. I want to be able to have two separate accounts, one for a memepage, and one for my personal page but Im unable to. Each time I try to create a new account, it says, Your account has been disabled for violating our terms. And when I try to create a new account with my current account/add an account, it says, Error: Were sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again. I dont know whats going on or how to fix this issue. I would very much appreciate it if there was a solution to this problem"
"Update. Fix issue and keep information in on devise and mute all #hashtage for hidden all info for me, block people,close all activity for close friends"
"Its usually pretty good. Recently, there have a few issues that have come up in the app, that werent there a week ago. A big issue is the not allowing 2 photos in the same post. As an artist, this is very hard for me to cope with, as I usually include a reference image or a picture of a different aspect. The second issue could be more of a personal thing, but its not showing my reels to anyone. I work really hard on my art, and in the past, Ive gotten anywhere from 100-1000 views in the first hour. Now, I get 100 veiws in mabey a week. Please fix this"
issue. within the past couple of days ive noticed notifications still pop up after youve logged out of an account... ive been logging out without saving log in info and im still getting notifications afterwards
"Update ALL accounts. Its the hardest thing when my personal account, my creator account &amp; my business account are all on different versions. One account I cant even add music to. Please fix this"
"Cant respond to group messages. On my personal account I have the ability to reply to a specific message in a DM group thread, or to use an emoji response. But on my professional account I dont have that ability at all. Its extremely frustrating because Im using the same device Ive even tried switching devices (iPhone vs. iPad) and it doesnt help. WTH?"
"Story music doesnt work. For some reason I cant get that to work. Used to work a while ago, but now Ive changed my account to personal account, still doesnt work"
"Meesenger features. I&#39;ve been updating regularly every time a new version is rolled out and still have ZERO access to the new messenger features. I&#39;ve tried deleting/reinstalling, logging in/out, restarting my phone, but to no avail. Not even updating the iOS changed anything. So the app, in actuality, isn&#39;t even updating anymore"
I constantly have a notification that I cant get rid of. There is always a notification on this app for no reason
Enjoyable. I enjoy scrolling and posting pictures on here. You see some incredible photos
"Awesome photo shoot. more than a photo session, it is an incredible experience  super talented and professional.  highly recommended"
"No update on main account. First of all this is a wonderful app, great app but my main problem is that my main account has not updated, I have three other accounts and they all have the new message update but my personal account does not, can you help me resolve this issue please"
"I m Sad . I am very sad. I have a private account, and when my posts are sent by my followers to their friends, my name does not appear like it was before, it was written for this personal account to see the post continued ... But now nothing is the worst thing that happened to me I became depressed because of you"
"Please Fix Compression on Carousel Posts. Instagram Team, I run a photography page on your platform and its extremely frustrating to post a carousel post and have all the frames so compressed that it seems more like I stole the photos rather than posted the full resolution 24.2MP files from my camera. Its gotten to the point of posting every picture that would be in a carousel as its own post and thats just becoming extremely frustrating. I understand carousel posts require a lot of data to be uploaded and compressing them lightens the load on everything but please fix the terrible resolution. I understand why I cant post all 24 megapixels but at least make them 1080p to fill the pixels on most peoples phones so the compression isnt immediately obvious. Thank you, any feedback or changes would be greatly appreciated"
No General inbox of flagging for personal account. Switched my account from creator to personal so I could make it private. And now I lost the ability to have a general and primary inbox and all my flagged DMs are no longer flagged. No option of flagging them
App will not let me log in. Its been 4 days and still cant access my account that Ive had for 9 years. Ive tired resetting my password but wont let me  get pass the page that ask me if all my information is still correct. Ive reported the problem on my other account and still have not gotten a response back. Is anyone else having this problem? If so please spam the reviews here so they see it
"My notifications stopped working. I deleted the app for a few days downloaded it back, and notifications dont come anymore"
Disabled. My account keep deleting disabled. I send email and I have not response  &amp; Now I cant log in into my personal account
"Instagram Notification Via whatsapp. Hey guys, my friend just received a notification to reset his password from instagram in whatsapp. Is that even possible that this was done by you guys. Or is somebody else trying to get into his phone"
"Problem. I cannot use the app normally, it doesnt refresh post neither with Wi-Fi or Cellular data, I need you to fix that problem, I just updated the app with the latest version.Today is November 10, 2020.Please fix this bug"
Oh you know what you did. Thank you for sell our informations Hope you rotten executives go to prison someday 
"Frustration. I have 4 accounts. 3 personal, and 1 public creator account. Of all these accounts, the creator account is the only one that cant access 60 sec reels and its the only one I want to make 60 sec reels with.Ive reported countless times for months and there is zero response or resolution"
". Instagram te hablo de la manera más seria posible... Ayer mi amor Jisoo quizo subir tres fotos a su cuenta personal de Ig y pues resulta que no pudo y las tuvo que eliminar, se puso muy triste y se tuvo que disculpar por sus historias, así que O ME SOLUCIONAS ESE PROBLEMA O NOS ARREGLAMOS A MADRAZOS PORQUE NO SOPORTO VER A MI BABY JISOO TRISTE gracias por la atención bye"
"Fake notifications. I have turned off all my notifications in the account settings, and yet persistent spam messages keep triggering notifications Why cant the biggest app in the world fix a simple bug like this? SPOILER: they dont want to. It drives engagement to see the little red icon, even if the notification is fake, they got you to open the app, where you will spend a few seconds, maybe see another advertisement, and have your time sold to some marketer"
Great app until hacker steals your account. Good luck getting help when your account gets hacked.  If the hackers change your email and you cant log in-their solutions under the help section wont work.  There is no phone number or email address to contact for help
Push Notification not working. My all notification access is given but then also Im not getting any kind of push notification on my phone. Even I also gave a reset but still its the same. Ive made report several times but then also it hasnt solved yet. All the accesses are given but still i am not getting any notification unless i enter the app. This is very annoying
No 5. NEVER giving a great rating till you ALLOW EVERY FUNCTION TO BE USED BY INTERNET ...NOT just the stupid no good ALWAYS HACKED app
"Issues with Reels. I love Instagram, and I love being able to create reels without having to get a tiktok- but its SO. BUGGY. Im not kidding. At one point, an entire animation video I was making crashed and I lost over an hour of progress. An issue will happen sometimes where Ill go in to edit a video, click the preview button, and itll glitch and repeat the same half second of my recording without allowing me to exit or even save it. I have to clear and reopen the app for it to work, and by then Ive lost my progress. Aside from that, theres issues where audio doesnt post with the video, captions are stretched out or dont line up with time stamps I set them to, or the audio wont begin to play when I hit record. My camera lags as well. Instagram is relatively user friendly and while solely the reshare button sucked (I liked that you could put custom pictures behind it though) the rest of it is pretty good. Just please. P l e a s e. Fix reel glitches oh my GOD"
cant log in. ever since i switched phones to an SE Ive been unable to log into my 2 accounts. I ca n log in to one on other devices except my own and my main personal account has been showing error on any device ever since Ive tried to log into through my phone
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BRING BACK CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE. Ive heard its available again but the function is not working for both my professional and personal accounts. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this
My account got deleted for some reason. My account was deleted for personal reasons and I didnt do that I was hacked someone else changed the password and now its disabled please help. also my user is @idk_your_sus dont judge the name I has nothing else in mind
Update info. Why isnt the update described?  Jackin a dog
No help with hacking account. I have tried everything that I can my information for the account has been changes and the needs more help signing in is not working. There is no one to message or speak with. Also they are doing nothing with the account even though me and my family have reported it along with some of my friends
Bugs on iPhone 11. I no longer receive notifications from this app. It worked fine until I updated my phone to IOS 13.6. IG had an update around the same time. Ive gone as far as to reset all data and settings on my phone and doing a complete reboot but its still not working. I  searched google for a resolution and found that its fairly common. Please send an update to fix this issue
Please fix this. After receiving a message and reading it or even after sometimes deleting it the message comes back and then wont allow me to delete it and says error try again later and then if the same person messages again then it shows as if they have two accounts in my messages when they dont ....pretty annoying and doesnt give you much privacy if someone was to go through your messages
Apply settings to multiple accounts. I love the messaging chat updates (themes)But I dont understand why it cannot be applied to multiple accounts. I have a food account and a personal account and Im unable to use these new chat themes on both and its really really annoying. Fix this please
"PLEASE fix notifications. I do not know what happened in the last update but it has completely broken all notifications in iOS. I get ZERO, not even badges, and have tried everything to fix it. Signed out, uninstalled and reinstalled, turned notifications on and off. It is very frustrating. My husband is on a Samsung Note and has zero issues. He gets all of his notifications, including sound alerts. It would be annoying enough just for personal users, but for people that use IG for business its a huge problem that affects my ability to use the platform. It is an iOS issue and seems like a pretty major problem to give some attention to fixing"
Ads. Ive been paying for ads on 2 different business pages and always experience issues. Such as now my ads arent Visible or delivering. Unfortunately IG doesnt have a way to just go in and fix it. Yes Ive already checked everything else to make sure its running fine. This app is extremely glitchy and problematic. My personal page is great though. The fact that Im spending money should allow for a great experience if not the best. Yet here i am taking a hit on both businesses due to all the issues
Follow button wont work. The last 4 weeks have been a headache when I cannot follow any users when the follow me. The follow back function is not working and this came after the latest updates. Tried uninstalling and deleting app and data and still to no avail Send halp Thanks
Dear instagram. I love you so much....thank you for keep my pictures and status privacy love Mandy kiss and hugs @instagram :)
"Someone hacked my deleted account. I deleted my account over a year ago. Yet, I received an email that someone logged onto my account. I had someone look on their app if my account was active and not only was it active, but I was following more people than I was when I deactivated the account. This is frustrating What am I supposed to do?"
So upset. Im so upset that I cant upload a video all it comes up with is  Will upload when better connection iv tired Wi-Fi and data but still the same issue comes up I never used to have this issue until recently. I have searched online and it says about converting it to H .265 whatever that means  Fix this please as Im not happy
"PLEASE FIX BUGS. Idk if the last update screw some stuff up. But the past few days i keep getting glitches. Like my feed will endlessly load. But not update. I can receive a meesage, but cant load the vid they sent. If i send a video or a pic. It sends for 5 hours and randomly spam send everything after. Ive reinstalled the app 3 times in the past 3 days. Restarted my phone countless times. Its not my data or internet because everything else loads with no problem at all. I love the app and this is honestly my first problem. But this is absolutely ridiculous"
Account Recovery. I am very surprised that accounts are not recoverable over a grace period. My original account of 8 years was deleted before I even got the notification that someone had accessed my account after my e-mail was hacked
Dont download unless you want to get risked getting hacked. Using this platform since middle school never have I ever been hackedwell until now and not very satisfied with the customer service they try to help but they are not even helping me on my account they keep sending my old one
Hacked. Can you please help get my account back its asiababy777 someone hacked into it now I cant get into it
"Stop bloody autoplay. Theres no way to stop the annoying videos, even when selecting less data option. Literally just irritating"
"Hacked. You guys make getting hacked so easy and then its impossible to get back into an account. Send me my code please. And how come I can log into my connected accounts but not my personal? This makes NO sense. Clearly if I can get into those, with the same password and phone number and email then I AM THE OWNER OF ALL ACCOUNTS. Have a better system in place. Everyone is sick to death of being hacked and then you not even having a system set in place to be able to contact someone and get it fixed This is now the second time Ive been hacked. I sent in a form and got zero response. Now Im upset. Do better please. FIX THIS thanks"
Someone help plz. Im not able to access any of my accounts anymore. I can make new accounts but I cant log into them at all. Plz help :(
Blurry videos. Scrolling down my feed and every single video is blurry (super pixilated) this has been happening since the latest update with WiFi and on data
"New update. Newest update is trash, let me scroll through my older posts, if I wanted to see suggestions I would go to that section, made it very un-user friendly.Give an option to turn off auto play on iOS to save data"

Theres no way to stop her from showing up over and over again. You have to stop her at once before she returnsGet rid of Glitter Face before I do You dont want that, do you? Then get rid of her hideous face before I do"
"Music sticker missing in stories. I love the app and I use it for personal use and as a blogger. However, my music sticker is been missing on my blog accounts for months. Ive reported the problem and it still hasnt been fixed yet. Id appreciate if this would get fixed especially since it works on my personal account and not on my blog account. Thanks"
"Tried & True But This HUGE Issue is Driving Me Insane. I love Instagram for the most part. Its probably my most used app. However I believe their linked accounts feature is glitchy at best. I have a Squarespace website that Im trying to link my business account to and Im simply not working. Ive tried everything. Although the personal and business accounts are linked and should have the same password, when I try to sign into the business account it says the password is incorrect. When I try to change the password it automatically signs me into my personal account. When I try to unlink the accounts Im not given the option to create a new password for the business account. Its insane. And of course theres no person to talk to in order to fix it. I need some type of elevated customer service because this isnt it"
Its not the end of the world. Basically i am trying to remove an ex from my bio after we broke up and it keeps saying failed so Ive been going to places with good wifi and using data and such even using different devices it wont work. Please fix it
Notifications. I cant get rid of the notification in the upper right corner of the app. I have looked everywhere and addressed every notification but the app icon still shows a notification and I cant get rid of it. Its super annoying and would love for it to go away
Disgraceful app. This app has many bugs and viruses shouldnt be available to download Get rid of app
Need support. My account has been recently hacked. They are impersonating me as well. They managed to changed the email and phone number so I am unable to secure my account.Can I have help getting @florr_abella back to me or deactivated as I dont want them scamming people. They are saying Ive invested in bitcoin which obviously I have not
I. Keep navigation private and Mute and block null not transfer my location and information
"Inspiring. By following the right accounts, a whole new world of inspiration unfolds. Weve discovered so much through scrolling these squares. Weve also inspired others and enables them to make their own personal discoveries "
Feedback error. Idk why this keeps popping out but real annoying just because I have 2 accounts one for work no personal it always logs me out of one nd the feed back error come out like cmon now
music. i recently got all the popular music taken away due to copyright which i understand but i switched to a personal acc so i can obviously get it back and it does not work yet after several times of reinstalling and logging in:(
Bug with audio. The audio to video doesnt work correctly. Every time I want to hear the sound of a video I have to click the silent button on the side of my iPhone on and then back off for it to play audio. Like do you guys fix anything or do you only care about selling data? Speaking of which why dont I get a cut if youre selling my data isnt it my data?
"Needs to be updated again. I love using my IG app for my personal and business pages but after updating the app, DMs notifications are not cleared even after seeing and reading the messages. Its getting annoying because I cannot tell if they are truly messages or not. Please fix the glitch as soon as possible"
Lay update bug. After the most recent update there have been many occasions where the content wont upload new all day. Sometimes for two days and this is on data as well as WiFi
"Story Reply DELETES CHAT. Horrible bug: I replied to my sister&#39;s story and when I went to our conversation, only that recent exchange was there in the thread. That, and her account information and our mutual followers, which I assume is a new feature at the top of NEW chats. My sister and I have had conversations on IG for many years and I hate to think they&#39;ve been lost forever. So far, not a fan of IG&#39;s new message update"

When I attempt to log into a different (personal) account, I start typing my user name and it pops right up, once I click it I get a red sorry, there was a problem with your request and then the app freezes"
Trouble Logging. The app completely refuses to let me log into my profile. Every attempt i make in logging in it will just say please wait a few minutes before trying again and I have been trying for an hour now. I tried clicking on forgot password? And putting in my information but it would just tell me error. Also the need more help? I clicked on that and it just keeps telling me error something went wrong. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???
Dont have access to reels. My art account still doesnt have reels on it While my personal one does Its unfair that I am not able to utilise this tool for my business How do I get it? Everyone else in the uk has it?
"App keeps Force Closing. Ive been using this app for a long time. Ive noticed over the last year, when I go to post a story, when Im finished taking a picture or video, the app force closes. Its to the point where its doing it almost every time I go to post a story. Makes me want to stop using the app and find something else. My app automatically updates, but the updates obviously havent fixed the issue"

"Update is garbage. I never write reviews. EVER. But since IG wants to ruin a good thing and become QVC, this has become a place for scammers and third party sellers trying to sell their crap quality items instead of a place for people to post pictures"
Hackers. Yall need to make a better way to recover your flipping accounts. I was hacked and they changed my email. You keep sending the reset info to the hackers  thanks for nothing
"Impossible to use. Hii  Using an iPad regularly and since the update the iPad doesnt seem to allow it to work. It calls people without me asking it to, jumps around all the time and its so frustrating. Please note that I am almost on 1k on one account and I cant delete it. My phone isnt the best for battery life and dont always have access to it. Please make it more suitable"
Always seems to be crashing and getting worse and worse. As of the Month of late September 2021 there has been nothing but problems. From crashing to making me change my passwords it has been horrible. October has topped it all with the down times. I have a personal account and store account as well. It has been so bad lately. Saying there is no internet connections when the Wifi connection and cell service is there. All these updates for nothing. Horrible. Sad this app was sold off to the king of selling off info and making sure profit comes before its members. What was once great is a shell of what it was. Keeps getting worse and worse
"Let me use the full size picture. It would be an incredible improvement to the platform if the entire photo could be used instead of being forcibly cropped. I could spend a lot of time going back through my pictures to edit them and make them smaller so I can get ever family member in a large group in the picture I post, but I dont have the patience to do so. Im sure I'm not the only one. I would post much more if uploading wasnt such a chore. Thanks"
Problem with the app. I had two accounts under the one log in - now one account has been deleted but the app will not let me login. I can only gain access to IG via computer mode - why is this?
"Music. Why does the button to add music on your story just randomly disappear???? I updated insta AND I'm on a personal acc, please find a way to fix this"
Cant log in to my other accounts. I cant switch my business account back to a personal account. I keep getting told I have promotions running when I dont
"The Messages. This may be a personal problem, but it keeps saying I have messages when I actually dont. So I leave the chat and refresh it, I cant see any previous chat history and then my whole phone glitches out"
Fix please. It doesnt want to load no matter what I do not on data nor internet it doesnt show a update either
Inconsistent roll out of features. I have fallen out of love with this app. With all the new features and changes it would be great if they could make the changes consistent across all accounts. My main creator account has never had reels added even though the roll out to the UK was months ago. My personal account which I rarely use has this feature and it makes no sense as to why one account would have it and not another
Customer service. I need help accessing my personal account I dont have access to my old email that is used to verify my account
Jecade. This happed on many occasions. The pictures on Instagram are fuzzy. A friend told me to delete it and re-download the app and now I cannot access it at all. It used to work very well. I have other friends who have the same problems yet others have none. These glitches before and after loading the new IOS 14 on my iPhone. What can I do to fix this?
"Story Sound Disappeared. Since the last update, when I try to share videos and reels on my story they do not have sound. on both of my accounts, Business and personal. This problem has occurred since I updated the app this morning, needs to be a quick fix. Liking stories isnt important but having sound is :("
"Glitchy. I dont receive private message notifications even though theyre switched on. I have tried deleting the app, reinstalling, updating, checking notification settings - everything"
"Login Issues. I literally cant even login into the app. Sorry, there was an problem with you requestEvery single time I try to login that comes up and its getting annoying, Im only trying to login so I can use the new features but info elsewhere says that you can block my ip on my phone or something? so I won&#39;t login because of certain things ive posted"

"I have not been able to login to my account for weeks now. Its been weeks and I havent been able to login to my account. Ever since I switched from a personal to a professional account, Ive been having problems with my IG where certain accounts cant even see my page. Then I deleted the app one day to take a SM break, then when I was ready to login again, I couldnt. Nothing works. The page just reloads every time I try to login. Ive tried resetting my password but I can never get past the see if anything changed part . I click done and nothing happens. Not sure what to do at this point"
166.0 update makes the app not work. Ive been stuck on the same page with no old or new content for the entire day. I have cellular data and wifi on and its still not allowing me to see anything but the homepage. Ive come to the conclusion that the update last night is responsible for this. Please fix this issue I really like the app
"Location isnt working when posting. My creator account relies on tagged locations to grow, but out of nowhere, it wont let me find the exact location when posting. When I use the explore page, it does, but not when posting. Also, my personal account can find it when posting, but not creator account. Its really hurt engagement. Ive reported it multiple times, but no response"
"Would give 0* if I could. Waste of time, the data collection, all of it. Just no"
"Unable to add music to IG stories. Like the title says, I cant add music. Regardless of what I do (uninstall/reinstall, switch to personal account, etc) the music sticker doesnt appear in my options. Terrible app"

"You are a trillion dollar company, get your app sorted. Crashes, doesnt load and what not. Reels are very difficult to edit via editor, which constantly crashes.

"Buggy and no customer service. My old 6yr old account got blocked as someone tried to hack it, can unlock it as i have no access to the phone number and email attached to the account and the customer service is not helpful, keeps telling me to use email or phone number, bots. Apart from that I still dont have the new update that came out like six months ago, no new message features like different color fonts or different reaction emojis, have no idea how to get that, no help in the help section or anywhere on the Internet. I love this app theres way more bugs that needs to be fixed, especially the customer service, as Id really like to get my account back because all my College work and contacts are on that account. It has been a year since my account has been blocked, and and I still cant get on it, more than that now I cant even contact the customer service, the button to contact them is fully gone"
Ummm what?. Its a good app but out of no where I cant get any notifications so I deleted it then got it back to see if its work but now I cant even download it :/
"My old account. Its fine and all, but it wont let me log into my old account. I made my old account private, but now its public and I cant get into it. I secured the account with an email, but now its saying i secured it with a number i havent heard of. I have personal and embarrassing stuff on that account, and would love for it to be deleted or privated at least. I dont have access to the account at all. Im a simplistic person, my passwords hardly change. This account apparently has none of them"
"5/5. This is deff a 5/5 for me, the only thing about this app is that it automatically stopped sending me my message notifications? If anyone has a resolution for this please give feedback"
Annoyed. Cant make more than 2 accounts I have a private and public account and I wanted to make one more for me and my friends to use but its not working. Me and my friends wanted to make a business account because were selling new products for our small business. Please help
NO REELS. I cant get REELS on my business IG page. I tried to reach out to IG with no response. I have the most up to date and I have it in my personal IG but not my Business
Story repost bug. The reposting of stories as a black image is maddening. The upload failed try again message is a personal attack on sanity
This is my favorite app but the notifications have not been working. A lot of people including myself have been experiencing a problem relating to the notifications not working for the past weeks or months. This needs to be fixed right away
"I cant send messages. Despite me having good connection and even switching between WiFi and data I cant send messages, I have tried deleting the app but to no avail. Its kind of irritating but nothing else is being affected. Can you look into this"
Mcornishdesign. I love this app and usually it is incredible however currently their seems to be some issues? Pictures arent loading or sending yet my wifi is good connection

Supposedly my account has been compromised more now than it had been in the past six years Please try and solve the privacy issue or protection issue, its worrying me a lot"
"Cant delete multiple accounts. My biggest frustration with IG is that Im unable to delete accounts that are either old or useless to me. Had I known, I would not have created them in the first place. Before, I was able to easily delete an account, no problem. Now I have my main art page which I worked very hard to get it where its at. I would be devastated if it accidentally got deleted. I have another page dedicated to something else that I now want to delete. My personal IG account has been blocked and no matter how many passwords I try Im unable to get in. They have a link they can send to your email. Only problem is that Ig provided me with their own email for me to create, and I now have zero access to it. Ive emailed customer support but they didnt get back to me for months and when they did, they tried to provide me assistance for an OLDER personal account that I created years ago. There is no easy way to go about deleting an account without risking deleting your main account. Youre unable to reach out to customer support, youre screwed with unwanted accounts because deleting them is a nightmare. If anyone knows how to delete an account, PLEASE let me know"
"Cannot take a picture when creating a new post. On my iPhone XR with iOS 14.4, the option to take a new pic is gone. I can only select photos from my camera roll. I reinstalled and reset my iPhone to factory settings and still the same issue. Switched from personal to professional and back , no results. I can take a new pic on my galaxy phone. I made sure I have camera access enabled and all that stuff. What am I missing??"
"Cannot update my phone number. Ive been trying to update my phone number for months already but whenever I try to get a confirmation code, it doesnt send me anything at all. I really need to update the number as soon as possible. Ive been going to the settings &gt; personal information and tried changing my number but again, it wont send me the code that I need. I have a business profile so my real contact information is on there, but on my actual account its a different number Ive never even seen before. My user name is @alenkakukinIf there is anyway you can help me out, please let me know. Thank you"
"Notifications not working. For several months now the notifications function (badges, notification screen preview, etc) has not worked. Ive tried everything from deleting app data &amp; reinstalling, signing out and back in, and making sure notifications were turned on in the app and in my phone settings. The only way notifications show up (as a badge on app icon at least) is AFTER i open the app, which kind of defeats the purpose of notifications in the first place (background app refresh is turned on)"
"Cant see reels. Whats up with only half the accounts being able to see reels? I can only see reels on my private account while my main has no access to the reels feature? Ive tried everything from logging out, updating, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesnt work"
"New interface is horrible. Theyre just trying to turn into Tik tok. Reals are taking over. Notifications and even the new post buttons are pushed to the side not even on the main bar (I thought new posts are typically important to apps run by posting) tons of glitches, every time I get a post notification and click it I go to a blank comments screen and have to return to the main page and search the account rendering it useless to have notifications. Put the shop off in the corner, not notifications and post creation button. Youre based on posts and pictures, stop selling out to trends and creating marketplaces for revenue"
"Low quality stories. Hey guys, anyone got problem with blurry stories even after checked option ,,high quality uploads,, and uploading over cellular data ? Help me fix it please :/"
"They dont have no customer services. Its been almost a MONTH since my account has been mistakenly locked. They never send no security code to my phones and I didnt link my email so I have no access to my Own account. This is ridiculous as I tried literally everything I fill out forms everyday, changing my passwords, searching for ways to solve this problem but NOTHING EVER WORKED Its gonna be Christmas and New Year I cant imagine my life without my account. As I want to call them, they only give me help center which is useless. I sent all of my private info to their mail include my passport and my pictures but they never reply. They caused my depression now I do self hurt everyday, crying for my lost account. Why they do this to me, I even got scammed for 120 dollars because I thought maybe hackers can help but it turned out they are indeed scammers. I request customer services"
"Fix security code issue. I was trying to change my password, as for someone had gotten into my account, and I was trying to change the email as well; because MY OWN personal phone number was not working. instead, it kicked me out, didnt let me use the new email, and will not send the code. You guys need to fix that non-sense"

"Constantly Crashing. The app has been crashing on me practically every time I try to use it. This has been happening for a very long time now. I make sure updates are current, and my phone has great service, unlimited data, a ton of storage. This is literally the ONLY app I have had a problem with. I used to love Instagram so much and I still try to get on every day. But now its more of a frustrating hassle and a headache than anything else. Developers: Please let me know what can be done to solve this issue. I used to be a 5-star rater. Ill continue to only give 1-star until this issue is fixed"
Terrible Customer Service. My account has been hacked for days. There is no customer support and no reliable way to recover the account. Deleting the app and selling all of my shares of the Company as this experience is likely indicative of how the Company is run more generally
"Riverside Fossil Jewelry. We are enjoying sharing our jewelry creations made from 3 million year old sand dollar fossils, as well as, some of our personal adventures with Instagram followers. Thanks Instagram"
"Are you this dumb?. If you cant tell that this is just another way for child trafficking, data mining and they sell out to big brother. Most sheep wont pay enough attention to it but at least Im not brainless"
"music problem. it happened again. i changed back to a business account to see insights , it wasnt anything serious but i noticed that you removed my music AGAIN. i find it annoying that happened. i use the music option quite often so its disappointing this happened. i even turned off being a business account and changed it to a personal account. please give it back. my @ is @christinexr please give it back its honestly pissing me off. this is the second time its happened"

Ghost message notifications are making me go crazy. I have never had an issue with Instagram before. I have 3 accounts (personal and 2 business accounts) and there is a ghost message notification that keeps jumping from one account to another.

Music glitch. Im going crazy not being able to get the music to show up on my IG STORY like they use to I dont get any type of popular songs any more just very strange background music. My app is updated. I switched from personal to business and thats when it started about a week ago... so I switched back from business to personal to see if that would make a difference but it didnt. Its driving me insane. Please help
Mi cuenta @maria_cano200. Me saco de mi cuenta personal me salía que decía que estaba comprometida y eso no me gustó 
buggy and slow. IG used to be great. Now its buggy. Videos dont play back smooth and take a while to load. New updates are altering UI making some business data difficult to access this taking more time to compare numbers between posts and reels. Things might be different in a few weeks but lately thats been the issue as of 03-04-2022
"Just wondering. Why does the music sticker appear then suddenly disappear from my IG? Please dont tell me to - update the app, log out and then back in, delete the app and then download again, report the issue in the app, or to change my app from business to personal or vice versa. You know why I said dont tell me not to do that? Because Ive done all of that and its still haphazardly there and then not. Whats the problem?"

Ive called my internet service and my router company and they have no advice. App works just fine on other WiFi and with data. Its only at home. No troubleshooting is helping"
I get bugs a lot. I have two accounts my main/personal and my meme account. I tried to go to my meme account to like my post that I posted on my main but it was like I was blocked and it didnt show up. I tried to see if I accidentally blocked myself and I didnt.

"DMs update. Im not normally one to write app review but this new update where the name shows up instead of the username is terrible and most people can agree that it should go back. Not only is it confusing when messaging people with the name, it also makes it extremely easily for someone to fake conversations or text notifications for their own personal gain. Bring back usernames in messages"

I understand that this is a business and your main goal is to sell things, but I find it incredibly annoying that the heart button on the main menu has been switched with the shop button, thereby making me go to the shopping section by force of habit when I am trying to go to my Feedback and likes. Its now more complicated to get to the feedback and likes section, which is significantly more important, as I am incredibly confident that I will never buy anything from you after this"
Good app but not letting me log into my biz account and my personal ac at the same time. Sent a msg to there help team and have not had a response weeks later. I would like to log into my 2 accounts but it will not let me. Bit frustrating

"Missing Music Sticker & Additional Bugs. I, as many others, have been missing the music sticker for some time. I have changed my account from business to personal, logged off my account, reinstalled the app, etc. yet still no solution. As a long time user, this is disappointing as I cant fully enjoy the Stories &amp; new Reels feature on the app.Also, my new stories arent showing up to be added to my present story highlights.Note: I have reported the first problem into the Report a Problem twice (a year plus ago &amp; months ago) and it hasnt been resolved"
Notifications. Hey my notifications are not working can you fix it and how do I turn them on on a iPhone XR
Latest update for iPhone has a glitch. I had to uninstall 2x because the stupid app keeps freezing and wont upload my story or post I have reset my data and restart my iphone so it is NOT an internet or phone issue
"Notification error. I keep on getting a notification saying i have one new message but whenever i check my private messages, theres nothing there? Is there a bug on the app?"
My dms wont work. For almost a whole year now I have sent in multiple complaints about my dms not working and nothing has been fixed. When I log into my spam account and I slide to dms nothing is there I have to create new message  to see them and then I cannot see if theyve replied unless I switch to my personal account and then switch back to my spam and re create a new message. Its very annoying to have to do this and I know Im not the only one who has this problem. Please fix it
Its ok need help with this notification glitch. So I turned off notifications on my settings do to spam from the ground chat I was in and now when I go into settings again the option to turn it on and off has disappeared and Im not trying to uninstall it because I dont remember my password and no longer have access to my email lol sooo yeahh
No reels feature. My creator account has no access to reels. I tried all the troubleshooting tips and submitted the issue to IG. I dont expect to hear back. Im in the U.S. my personal account has reels and Ive experienced this issue on 2 different devices...so I know its an account issue unfortunately. Would love to grow my brand but Im kind of at a stalemate with this. Womp
"Might change to a one star. Ive been seeing people complaining a lot about being blocked, and every weekend I am blocked for a hour.. I dont use the app a lot week day but weekends if I dont work I use the app.. normally when I am blocked I report the issue, mind you this happens EVERY WEEKEND... and after a hour it fixes it self.. last weekend over 100 of my drafts disappeared ... annoying but fine whatever... this weekend they not only have blocked me from liking post, I cant even post myself.. ive sent pictures of my phone data that proves its me using this app.. im not using a 3rd party app which should be made pretty clear considering I am also answering messages from people during this time... I understand people have abused your program but you are also punishing people who arent abusing it"
Audio constantly cuts out of video. Basic bug that should have been solved a decade ago. Almost like they are using it as a form of tracking in the algorithm
Reel has been removed. I have 2 creator accounts for my businesses and a personal page. All 3 had reels on in a d now for some reason reels has been removed from one of my creator accounts and there is no where to get help to re add it. Very frustrating
User Experience is not a priority. The new layout was not designed with user experience in mind. It is horrible. Its almost a game of hide and seek to access comments or anything other than the tiresome Reels. Roll it back to the layout that works
Old account. Hello. I wish I was able to access my old account @lovingmelovingyou. I was hacked on 9/9/19 and not able to access it again

"Missing Music Sticker After update 2020. After the automatic update November 2020 I no longer have access to the music sticker. I deleted the app and reinstalled, switched from business to personal to creator and still no music sticker for stories or audio for reels. Any other suggestions?"
Reel update. I like the reel feature but I have two accounts. On one account it allows 30 seconds. But on my second account only 15 seconds which is annoying. I can post my 30 second reels on h personal but for my business page I am having to re edit it to 15 seconds. Why is this?
"Fake Notifications. I have 3 linked accounts. My personal, my book review, and another. I dm with people on my review account a lot and I normally only had a notification on that account but lately my other two are showing that I have an unread message. I finally got it to go away on my third account but I cant get it to go away on my personal. I tried everything and did everything it says to try online. Nothing. I do not even have one DM on my personal account anymore. I deleted them all but it is still saying I have a message.This is plain frustrating cause I use the red dot under the profile to know if I have a DM on my other two accounts"
"Lovely app, its the music feature thats the problem. I have tried absolutely everything to add music to my stories/reels. As a business owner, adding an upbeat touch to these would be great I have no music option as a sticker, I have no audio option in reels either. It keeps saying IG music doesnt work with some accounts Ive logged out, deleted the app, reinstalled and its up to date completely. Ive changed my business account to personal, back to business and set it up again.. still nothing. HELP"
No Reels?. My accounts do not have the Reels feature I cant watch or create them. I simply do not have the option I have tried every fix available on google. Written to IG MANY times with no reply. There is virtually no way to get assistance. I find this incredible frustrating and discriminatory as someone that is trying to grow a following - without access to the features that feed the algorithms. Fix this please
i lost my account. i lost my main account and im currently using my second account but is messed up cause i put in my info on my main just in case this situation happened and every information i put was correct but when i was trying to log in it was missing so many things like my email it was missing 3 letters this is sad
Very disappointing. Extremely poor customer support. My personal account got hacked through a phishing site and I have been trying for the past month to get my property back and communicate with my family during these hard times but they have yet to solve my issue even after a month of attempts and continuous help requests . @elevenismynumber
"Invalid parameters. Invalid parameters every time I try to login, its getting super annoying as I have a business and personal account saved on the app"
"Been reporting for 1 year, reels still dont work. Reels have been around in Australia for almost a year and yet I am still unable to use them on my business account.I have reported the problem over 5 times and yet no solution.If youre going to set up your entire algorithm around them, why not just make them accessible to everyone. Also they are available on my personal account but not my business one where I would actually need them. ACC - @nainisnibbles"
Multiple video post never uploads. Every time I try to make a post including multiple videos it always says something went wrong and when I press the retry button nothing happens and I have no choice but to select remove. This has been the case over about 7 updates and none of the bug fixes appear to have amended it as of yet. Nothing to do with wifi or data connection. Ive noticed this isnt a problem for everyone but I know a few people who also experience this. Very annoying please fix
"No. Theres so many buttons on the Home Screen now. Its so cluttered. Reels is awful, let tik tok be tik tok and stop trying to steal everything from every popular social media app. Also, Theres so many spam bots"

"I love it but. The app just stopped working. It says it doesnt connect to the internet even though its working. Since then Ive tried everything, by turning off my phone, switching between Wi-Fi and personal data, logging out or deleting the app and downloading it back but now I cant even log in. The phone is definitely not a problem as its the only app that does not work. It just wouldnt load or let me do anything"
Bugs and errors. This is my most used app and its incredible however theres glitches happening and its bugging me as I cant talk to my mates or do anything because it keeps coming up with errors occurred
"PLEASE NEW UPDATE- VIDEO CHAT AVAILABLE FOR LAPTOP. The app itself is amazing. Filters and other are incredible. Though, I notice that my phone batterie too fast with &#39;Video Chat&#39; on my phone, especially, when I am calling for a long time. Making this options &#39;video chat&#39; available on &#39;LAPTOP&#39; would be amazing. Support developer for a new upgrade"
"Business Location. Ive placed numerous request to get my business location updated on IG and have gotten NO RESPONSE. Ive done it with both my personal IG and my business IG several times. My Business is called @OhCrapiCracked located at 7653 Pines Blvd Pembroke Pines, FL 33024Its correct on Google and Verified but IG puts my business 5,500 miles away in the Ocean.

Sleepwalking into insanity. A third of the world manipulated by an insidious malware masquerading as a free application on your little phone. Data collated and not paid for. Given freely. All you have to do is spend your waking life interacting
New Update glitchy and horrible. New update is glitchy. Refuses to upload things to my story OR will upload 2-3 copies of the same video or picture. Will change review when I notice an improvement. Everything else is fine besides the terrible choice they made a while ago to not have the home page in order of date and time
"This aint it. FIX THE MUSIC STICKER It doesnt appear as an option now for me on my business and personal accounts. Also, reels are terrible"

I experienced it with my friend and it was awesome, please can I get a developer feedback it would be nice...And also please give me these features Theyre amazing"
. Its si slowly for loading data
"Disappointed that this is all video reels. This is such an incredible resource for art, design, small business owners etc. The transition to mostly video is obnoxious, redundant and has lost so much of what we loved. Horrible change made recent. I can barely access it with it showing 80% reels"
"Cant login. Been getting a notification when I open the app: no internet connection, but internet access is fine and other apps work"
Worst app. This app is the worst it literally stopped working for no reason and I have a lot of information on there so 
keep Watch button. Can you get rid of the keep watching function when videos are playing. Its so bloody annoying
Get rid of the shop button. PLEASE get rid of the shop button where the notifications button used to be. This is so dumb and not user friendly. I promise all users would rather have quicker access to our notifications instead of shop
60 second reel option disappeared. My 60 second reel option disappeared off of my business account with the new update 2 days ago. I still have the option to use it on my personal account. Can someone help me restore this feature ASAP?

update bad i think. hi please get rid of the reels thing and also put notifications where it was. this is a photosharing app not a store and its not tiktok sorry babe
Change the way it looks back to how it was before the update. look this is a personal preference but ive come across multiple people that have the same input i think it was better before the update where you could actually slide out of the dms instead of having them down where the like used to be other than that really enjoy the app but would suggest putting it back to normal
"No update. I have no update for a year, there's no possibility for me to update the app. I live in Italy where reels are available for a year or so, still I don't have them. Neither I have new functions of messager. It says that I have the newest version, though I understand that everyone but not me really have it. I tried everything: changed the data, delete and install the app, I even changed the phone-same result. I asked for help though the team didn't reply to me. So I'm dissatisfied and still wait for some response"
Cant log in with a new phone. When you reset password on a new phone it blocks access and your account eventhough you have the correct recovery credentials. Useless
Need to fix. Love the app just wish for are settings we can have are same gmail on different accounts just makes sense . also I have 2 accounts one for Business and the other for personal and it keeps telling me to add my gmail and when I do it keeps saying I cant enter that email and is already used on my other previous account I just feel like that should be changed because just helps me manage my accounts
Todo lo ves no lo tomes personal. Muy buena plataforma
"Eww so much for my data. Reels is bad enough, but could we get a. Option where they don&#39;t autoplay? I don&#39;t want this stupid tiktok-copucat crap eating my data. Heck, I don&#39;t want it PERIOD but really"

"Great when it works. Was good up until a month ago. DMs stopped loading now the only way I can see them is by making sure the app is closed and clicking on notifications when they come through. Tried everything I could read online to try to get it to work again. logging out, deleting data and reinstalling but no joy. Messaged support which is non existent. Apparently the only way I know how to fix it is by creating a new profile which I dont want to do"
"Music is broken. My music is broken, I try to put music on my stories and the only music that comes up is weird songs but no popular artists, and its really annoying. I tried to switch back to a personal account and it still wont work. I dont know how to fix this problem"
Wont send verification code. I recently was able to use my account until I decided to visit my second account only to receive a verify your own account so I accepted and Waite side the code.Several minutes went by and nothing came up.I began resending the code and it stopped and wouldnt allow me to log back into my personal account so I deleted the app to reinstall until it logged me out of my account as well whenever it send the code it either doesnt send the code or just says error like really? Not cool.Please know that I love this app more then anything But just dear lord help me. This has taken all of my patience away and I need my account for privacy so please respond QUICKLY with a method to fix this..My account doesnt have a email since its already used but my phone number NEVER gets a verification code when I ask for it.ITS GETTING OLDREALLY??? After making a new account you decided to restrict me from content??? Not only that but you wont let me post??? What the hell NOT COOL

"Well try again when theres a better connection error message. Ive tried using wifi &amp; data, deleted the app &amp; redownloaded. I havent been able to upload my scheduled post Please help"
"Terrible. I dont know how I can even rate this garbage app because it literally wouldnt even allow me to access my account. I created one, and if I try to log into it, it says the account doesnt exist, but when I try to re-create the same account with same information it tells me that there is already an existing account with that username/passcode. So, no matter what there is always an error. All I can say is, personally, I wouldnt recommend this app, because all it did was frustrate me"
Push notifications not working. I have checked all my setting uninstalled and re-installed the app. Signed in and out and still no fix to this issue. Kind of hard to keep track of customer trying to get a hold of me if Im not notified via push notifications or notification icons on app. Please fix this
Account help. Hey Ive been having trouble accessing my other private account. I know the password and username but it keeps saying its wrong and trying to send a code to my old number. Can I please get some assistance to retrieve my account back please??

Fr. Incredible app you can do hatever do you want
"Why doesn't IG rotate on the iPad. I use a keyboard case with my iPad (6th Gen) and this is the only app that doesn&#39;t rotate sideways like every other app. It is bit annoying  to have to constantly flip my iPad off of the keyboard to use IG since I use it for uploading my art work and whatnot. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#39;t for this lacking feature. If you are going to be charging me my personal data to use your &#34;free&#34; entertainment service, the least you could do is make it convenient across every device. C&#39;mon man"

Disable auto play. Please for the love of god give us the option to disable auto play for videos. Its horribly non-inclusive for those of us with visualdifficulties and nausea Not to mention it eats up your data and clogs your phone memory.Is IG really thay callous that it purposefully doesnt cater to disability?
No reels. Its been over 6 mo. since reels came. I have 2 accounts and my personal have reels but my other one dont. Can you please make it available to everyone? I really want to use reels on my creator page more than my personal
"No reels. I dont have reels still And I strictly mean my personal account, all others my accounts have it just now mine personal. And its so frustrating"

Once I got all my data, When I tapped Continue, this message popped up, saying that they couldnt accept my request to create it Thats why I keep deleting my gmail account. Now Im angry.

Idk. To be honest the app is good and everything but one problem I have is the update. Im logged on to atleast 3 accounts since Im an editor and not all of the accounts have the same update?

Bug with audio. The audio to video doesnt work correctly. Every time I want to hear the sound of a video I have to click the silent button on the side of my iPhone on and then back off for it to play audio. Like do you guys fix anything or do you only care about selling data? Speaking of which why dont I get a cut if youre selling my data isnt it my data?Update: this app has even more audio problems than before. You guys are trash at fixing issues. Why is it when I turn the volume rather up or down it automatically mutes all the audio? Close to deleting this app like everybody else I know
"Can only post one photo??. i updated, cleared data and cachpa(??)) , undownloaded n redownloaded n nothing works"

FIX DM. Fix DM switch (between personal and general chats). When I switch it I dont see recent chats. Its really annoying to restart an app just to see my messages

Account login. Ive been having trouble trying to access my account for the pass few days &amp; nobody was able to help.

Horrible. Terrible. With new update it only gives me the option to watch reels and not even search for any other pictures or people I know

Hey. Theres no notification in iPhone
"Fix the audio glitch. Youre one of the largest companies in the world, yet, the issue with audio cutting in and out persists for over a year where the only solution is to restart my phone or delete and re-download the app. Maybe take a 5 minute break from dreaming up new ways to abuse users data for profit and fix this absurd glitch"

"App keeps crashing. Ive noticed over the last few months, the app will crash randomly. It happens 3-4 times a day. Ive redownloaded the app and updated my phone and its still happening. Also, if yall could consider putting the notifications tab back at the bottom that would be GREAT Or at least let users customize based of their personal preferences. Lets be honest, people care way more about that than the shopping tab"

"Horrid. Used to be my favorite app, but now it crashes every time I open it. Probably because the entire app is just an overwhelming amount of brands and people trying to sell me things. Also there isnt an original aspect of this app at this point, developers just keep adding in a ripoff element of every new app that comes about. Miss the days where we could post fun pictures in peace. Bad"

Working fine until today. Working fine but now wont load anything. Will open but says no internet connection but have tried on wifi and data and no difference. This update fixing bugs is a joke more like making bugs
A nail in humanitys coffin. A proponent and encourager of narcissism....A gatherer of residual data....An encourager of jealousy and envy....A source of desperation

"Disable double tap switch account feature. The new feature that allows you to switch between accounts by double tapping on the bottom right of the Home Screen is driving me crazy. Its so sensitive to my touch that its constantly jumping back and forth between my accounts, which is awful. Will you please allow this feature to be disabled or remove it altogether? I have a personal account, and three others I manage for work and this feels like a nightmare. I had no issue with the former protocol for switching between accounts. It worked really well.

Crashing. No matter how many updates I get on my app. It always seems not to let me search for any artist of my liking.

"Suggestion. Hey, so I was wondering if this could possibly happen. I have noticed that on some apps you have the option to search through a conversation with a simple keyword. And that keyword would pop up in multiple threads of a conversation you have with that person. Take discord for example. If you were to search up, for example: &#34;Hey&#34;, it would pop up all the &#34;heys&#34; that have been used in that conversation. And with dates as well. So, a similar addition to discord. I just think it would be helpful. Thank you :)"
All of a sudden videos stop playing midstream. WTH  Every single video stops/freezes up and wont play beyond a certain point. Never used to do this. I deleted the App and reinstalled. Nope  Changed data settings. Nope  What gives?  Fix this bug or Im off Instagram for good just like I deleted my FB account
Great experience. Its an incredible experience keep me entertained for hours lo
Crashes constantly. New update is absolutely terrible. Cant make a post without the app crashing. I need this for my personal business and using it has been an absolute hassle. 0/5
Updated app now crashes . App continually now crashing within 3seconds when I switch to secondary personal account. Very frustrating Was fine until update (yes iOS is up to date and phone has plenty of spare storage)
Reels. When ever I try and watch the reels it does not work it just waits there and loads and then goes then stops. Even tho I have full bars of wifi or when Im on my data.  Pls fix
"No more. Okay, enough with the Reels.  I have never once, for any reason ever, indicated any interest in dancing or in people who do dance, and all I have seen today is about 80 different people dancing at me when suggestions auto-plays their stupid videos. Which is great, because not only do I hate it, but it also drains my data"
"Password Reset Wont Work. Okay, so, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to fix an issue, but now Ive run into a new issue.Even though my email is correct, and I took a photo of it before logging out/uninstalling the app, whenever I try to get a recovery code for my account or to reset my password, nothing gets sent to my email and Ive checked in maybe 50 times in 18 hours. I tried calling their support number and they basically dont provide human help from it. And the email in which their site says to contact them on, doesnt work anymore either. This is a real big issue as I need my account back due to it having personal information and very important chats that I need"

Audio issues. Idk why but when I check IG today the sound refuses to work. Should I delete the app &amp; download it again?
Reels are rubbish. I am so sick of IG shutting down when I try to post reels. Please fix this issue Also on my personal profile no reels available whats the go? Sort it out guys its becoming a waste of time
Ruined the app. The shopping button has really ruined the fluidity of the app. Please switch it back. The bottom menu should be for our personal uses. Anything else can go up top of the main screen
"Really. Ive enjoyed this app for many years now, to be specific 2012. All of a sudden now, I cant access the app. I download it, log in, and it instantly crashes. Ive re-downloaded at least 10 times now and the same results incur. Any way to fix this, seems kind of unfair?"
"App doesnt work for me after changing my password. I recently got an email saying sorry to hear youre having trouble accessing your account, but that wasnt the case at all so I thought someone was trying to hack my account. I changed my password immediately, then tried to log back into my account with the new password, and now it seems like the log in button isnt working? Ive tried deleting the app and reinstalling and nothing has worked"
Constant Freezing/unresponsive mess. Ever since the iOS 15 update that allows you to stop cross-app tracking the app has done nothing but freeze more than it actually works. Have deleted and redownloaded the app numerous times and the same always happens

"Cannot sign up. Tried to use my email account to create an account, but failed. When trying to create again, it says my email account is already linked to a user, but i cant sign in with my email as it says something like cannot find user. I guess my email is blocked, just because i refuse to link to my facebook and phone number?"
App is crashing. Starting 5/30 the app is just crashing and cant open it.  How can i fix this problem?  I tried to delete the app and reinstall it but it says i will loose my data?
"Problems every time I change my passwor. I have two accounts - one business and one personal. Without fail, every time I change my password I ALWAYS have issues logging back into my personal account. I never have issues logging back into the business account - just the personal account. This happens every single time. I email the help section every time with this issue and they have never responded or offered any help whatsoever. Its ridiculous"

Inconsiderate. Get rid of the Reels tab and bring back notifications and posting the way it used to be this update is annoying and such a horrible design
"Weird Reel Issue. Recently, when i click the reels tab and swipe down to the next video, the first videos audio will keep playing. Just over the first shot on the video Im trying to watch. It happens every time I swipe to a new video.I have to swipe down again then back up, over and over, to watch the video.Ive tried using Instagram on data or on different WiFis and it still doesnt work. Please fix this"
The reels suddenly disappeared. I am very disappointed. I upgrade my device and since then I dont have reels It doesnt make sense. I have contacted you twice but I havent received an answer.

Incredible. Absolutely incredible app
"Vanishing needs to vanish. Since they introduced this annoying feature that cant be permanently disabled, Ive lost two conversations because i swiped up too quickly and accidentally triggered the feature. Devs should change that and use a gesture thats not one of the most common two gestures app users perform (swiping up and down), or better yet, make it something that can be turned on and off from a conversation setting rather than a common gesture thats used to navigate content. This really is bad design and makes no sense"
